This Repository contains FASS-BSLR, a dataset and a benchmark suit to facilitate developing and evaluating fully automated techniques for the step of ‘study search’ in conducting biomedical Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs). 

The SLRs Related works were acquired using various Pubmed APIs, given the doi of a work. Information such as Abstracts, authors, titles, publisher, and more were included. 

The overall repository is organized into 2 folders: Dataset, and Baselines.

Dataset contains the main 'output' of our overall work.

Dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before discussing the three sub folders in the Dataset folder, we will address the Covid_SLR_Dataset.xlsx file.

~~~EXCEL FILE~~~

The SLR dataset file contains some initial metadata about each of the 111 (2-112) SLRs. The DOI, PMCID, Abstract, Title, list of authors, and publisher are all included where applicable. Certain files were unreachable via PubMed's APIs, and as such, were filled in to the best of our abilities given what was readily available.

The file also includes the queries generated by ChatGPT. These are listed in columns K, M and O. 
Column K holds the queries based on just the SLR title, Column M contains the queries based on the title and Abstract of the SLR. Column O is deprecated.  

~~~Seeds.xlsx~~~
All the seed studies for each SLR.

~~~SetB.txt~~~
The index of SLRS that are included in SetB.

~~~slrDates.txt~~~
The publication date for each SLR. When searching through PubMed, we limit the search to retrieve all articles published before the specified date for each SLR.

~~~slrKeywords and slrTitles~~~

Keywords and the title of each SLR.

~~~FOLDS FOLDER~~~

The folds folder contains 5 folders, which each have 2 separate files: Excel and Json. These folders contain SLR files (n.xlsx, n.json) which contain metadata about the related works included in the SLR: Doi, Date published, Title, Abstract, Authors, ID, and ID Format. Publisher is listed under the 'Misc. Data' Column.

The master folder contains the SLRMapping file which contains the mapping of each SLR to one of the 5 folds. This mapping was done by taking the original 2-112 slrs, and assigning each a random number between 2 and 112. Based on the number assigned, they were recategorized into a fold (2-24 is fold 1, 25-47 is fold 2, etc.)


~~~QREL FOLDER~~~
The Qrel Folder contains 'qrel style' files for each of the folds. All dois found to be included in the SLR have a value of '1' (correct). 

The qrelSetA and qrelSetB.txt contain the relevance judgement for Set-A, and Set-B, respectively.

~~~ADDITIONAL FILES ~~~
There are two sub folders in the additional files folder.

The citationGraph folder contains the citation graph for the first 5 related works whose full texts can be retrieved from pubmed. Each paper on the citation graph contains the Title, Abstract, full text and list of Authors. References are stored as well. This section contains the most 'text-dense' information while still remaining tightly related to each SLRs general topic. 

The authorWorks folder contains the name of each author who contributed to those initial 5 works, as well as all the works they have participated in (so long as the works are published on pubmed) These works are stored as PMID (NOT PMCID!)

The master file contains the information of all the previous files.

~~~QUERIES FOLDER~~~
The Queries folder contains 6 files, (1) ChatGPT.txt  redirects to the file for chatGPT queries, which is Covid_SLR_Dataset.xlsx (C), (2) ElasticTitlesAbstsract.txt  contains the title as well as the abstract, used to query our Elasticsearch Database, (3) Human Made Queries.xlsx contains the manual queires for Set-B, (4) ChatGPT-PE Queries, No Seeds.xlsx contains queries crafted using the ChatGPT-PE method, (5) ChatGPT-PE Queries, with Seeds.xlsx contains queries crafted using the ChatGPT-PE method, considering seed studies, and (6) ChatGPT-Title Queries, with Seeds.txt contains queries crafted using the ChatGPT-Title method, considering seed studies.

~~~RUNS FOLDER~~~
The Cord-19 folder contains two sub folders: BM25 retrievals, and LM Retrievals. These retrievals were retrieved using an elasticsearch index containing the CORD-19 dataset.
The ChatGPT-PubMed contains the retrieval using ChatGPT-Title, and ChatGPT-PE methods. For ChatGPT-Title, we provided the results for 10 different runs, when run1 is the one used in our experiments.
The ChatGPT-PE-WithSeeds and ChatGPT-Title-WithSeeds folder contain the results obtained from ChatGPT-PE and ChatGPT-Title with seed documents.
Finally, PubMed folder contains the results obtained from posing the title, and the keywords to the PubMed.
