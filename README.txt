This Repository contains FASS-BSLR, a dataset and a benchmark suit to facilitate developing and evaluating fully automated techniques for the step of ‘study search’ in conducting biomedical Systematical Literature Reviews (SLRs). 

The SLRs Related works were acquired using various Pubmed APIs, given the doi of a work. Information such as Abstracts, authors, titles, publisher, and more were included. 

The overall repository is organized into 3 folders.

Dataset contains the main 'output' of our overall work.

Baselines contain 'gold standard' outputs of queries to the cord-19 dataset, as well as pubmed.

Source contains all code used to generate files in the Dataset and Baseline folders.

Below is more information about each of these three folders

Before discussing the three sub folders in the Dataset folder, we will address the Covid_SLR_Dataset.xlsx file.

~~~EXCEL FILE~~~

The SLR dataset file contains some initial metadata about each of the 111 (2-112) SLRs. The DOI, PMCID, Abstract, Title, list of authors, and publisher are all included where applicable. Certain files were unreachable via Pubmed's Apis, and as such, were filled in to the best of our abilities given what was readily available.

The file also includes the queries generated by ChatGPT. These are listed in columns K, M and O. 
Column K holds the queries based on just the SLR title, Column M contains the queries based on the title and Abstract of the SLR. Column O contains queries based on the title, Abstract, as well as the Title And Abstract of the 5 chosen related works. These 5 related works were chosen specifically as the full text of them is accessible via the pubmed api.

~~~FOLDS FOLDER~~~

The folds folder contains 5 folders, which each have 2 separate files: Excel and Json. These folders contain SLR files (n.xlsx, n.json) which contain metadata about the related works included in the SLR: Doi, Date published, Title, Abstract, Authors, ID, and ID Format. Publisher is listed under the 'Misc. Data' Column.

The master folder contains the SLRMapping file which contains the mapping of each SLR to one of the 5 folds. This mapping was done by taking the original 2-112 slrs, and assigning each a random number between 2 and 112. Based on the number assigned, they were recategorized into a fold (2-24 is fold 1, 25-47 is fold 2, etc.)


~~~QREL FOLDER~~~
The Qrel Folder contains 'qrel style' files for each of the folds. Because the queries performed by the original SLR were not performed here, all dois listed have a value of '1' (correct). 

The qrel.txt and qrelMod.txt files have the information of all folds, sorted by SLR number. The difference between these two files is simply in the formatting of spaces in the files.

~~~ADDITIONAL FILES ~~~
There are two sub folders in the additional files folder.

The citationGraph folder contains the citation graph for the first 5 related works whose full texts can be retrieved from pubmed. Each paper on the citation graph contains the Title, Abstract, full text and list of Authors. References are stored as well. This section contains the most 'text-dense' information while still remaining tightly related to each SLRs general topic. 

The authorWorks folder contains the name of each author who contributed to those initial 5 works, as well as all the works they have participated in (so long as the works are published on pubmed) These works are stored as PMID (NOT PMCID!)

The master file contains the information of all the previous files.

~~~QUERIES FOLDER~~~
The Queries folder contains two files, one redirecting you to the Covid_SLR_Dataset.xlsx file for chatGPT queries, and another containing the title as well as abstract, used to query our Elasticsearch Database.

~~~RUNS FOLDER~~~
The Cord-19 folder contains two sub folders: BM25 retrievals, and LM Retrievals. These retrievals were retrieved using an elasticsearch index containing the CORD-19 dataset.
Each of these subfolders contains a normal ...Searches, ...withSources, and ...WithSources_FILTERED file. 
The normal 'searches' file contains the retrievals upon searching for just the title. The WithSources file contains the retrievals from searching the title and abstract, the filtered variant contains only entries that are indexed on pubmed (According to the CORD-19 dataset).
