Global Seasonality of Human Seasonal Coronaviruses: A Clue for Postpandemic Circulating Season of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2? Background The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could recur as seasonal outbreaks, a circulating pattern observed among other preexisting human seasonal coronaviruses (sCoVs).  However, little is known about seasonality of sCoVs on a global scale.   Methods We conducted a systematic review of data on seasonality of sCoVs.  We compared seasonality of sCoVs with influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus.  We modeled monthly activity of sCoVs using site-specific weather data.   Results We included sCoV seasonality data in 40 sites from 21 countries.  sCoVs were prevalent in winter months in most temperate sites except for China, whereas sCoVs tended to be less seasonal in China and in tropical sites.  In temperate sites excluding China, 53.1% of annual sCoV cases (interquartile range [IQR], 34.6%–61.9%) occurred during influenza season and 49.6% (IQR, 30.2%–60.2%) of sCoV cases occurred during respiratory syncytial virus season.  Low temperature combined with high relative humidity was associated with higher sCoV activity.   Conclusions This is the first study that provides an overview of the global seasonality of sCoVs.  Our findings offer clues to the possible postpandemic circulating season of SARS-CoV-2 and add to the knowledge pool necessary for postpandemic preparedness for SARS-CoV-2.
Clinical Features of COVID-19 and Factors Associated with Severe Clinical Course: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Background: COVID-19 is a new disease which has become a global pandemic, and is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The disease is still not very well characterized, and factors associated with severe clinical course are not well known.  Methods: The main objectives were to determine the demographic, clinical and laboratory manifestations of COVID-19 and to identify the factors associated with severe clinical course. We searched the PubMed for studies published between Jan 1, 2020 and Mar 17, 2020, and included them if they were in English language, published in full, were retrospective or prospective observational or case control study with data on clinical, laboratory and imaging features of adult patients with COVID-19 disease from single or multiple centers. Studies that included exclusively pediatric patients were excluded. The demographic, clinical and laboratory data was displayed as n (%) or mean (SD). The meta-analysis on factors associated with severe clinical course was performed using the random effects model, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as the effect sizes.  Findings: We included 58 studies (6892 patients) for the systematic review on clinical manifestations and 21 studies (3496 patients) for meta-analysis on factors associated with severe clinical course. The mean age of patients with COVID-19 is 49.7±16.3 years with a male to female ratio of 1.2:1. Common symptoms and their frequency are: fever (83.4%), cough (60.5%), fatigue (33.8%), sputum (28.9%), dyspnea (22.1%), myalgia (20.6%), chest tightness / pain (16.3%), sore throat (13.5%), headache (11.2%), diarhhea (7.5%), nasal congestion / rhinorrhea (6.7%), nausea / vomiting (5.6%), pain abdomen (4.6%), and hemoptysis (1.7%). The comorbidities associated with COVID-19 are: hypertension (18.4%), diabetes mellitus (9.8%), cardiovascular diseases (8.8%), endocrine diseases (5.8%), gastrointestinal diseases (5%), CLD (3%), and COPD (2.8%). Among the laboratory parameters WBC was low in 27%, high in 9%, platelets were low in 22.9%, creatinine was high in 6.5%, AST was high in 25.3%, ALT was high in 22.7%, bilirubin was high in 8.8%, albumin was low 60.1%, CT chest was abnormal in 89%, CRP was high in 67.5%, LDH was high in 52%, D-dimer was high in 34.8%, CK was high in 14.4%, and procalcitonin was high in 15.4%. Factors significantly associated severe clinical course (with their ORs) are as follows: High CRP (5.78), high procalcitonin (5.45), age >60 (4.82), dyspnea (4.66), high LDH (4.59), COPD (4.37), low albumin (4.34), high D-dimer (4.03), cardiac disease (3.88), low lymphocyte count (3.22), any associated comorbidity (3.16), diabetes mellitus (3.11), high WBC count (2.67), high bilirubin level (2.55), high creatinine (2.34), high AST (2.31), hypertension (2.30), low platelets (1.78), High ALT (1.69), high CK (1.66), fever spikes ?39°C (1.59), diarrhea (1.55), male gender (1.47), and sputum (1.35).  Interpretation: Identification of these factors associated with severe COVID-19 will help the physicians working at all levels of healthcare (primary, secondary, tertiary and ICU) in determining which patients need home care, hospital care, HDU care, and ICU admission; and thus, prioritize the scarce healthcare resource use more judiciously. Many of these identified factors can also help the public at large in the current COVID-19 epidemic setting, to judge when they should seek immediate medical care.
Suboptimal Quality and High Risk of Bias in Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies at Chest Radiography and CT in the Acute Setting of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review Purpose To synthesize the literature on diagnostic test accuracy of chest radiography, CT, and US for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients suspected of having COVID-19 in a hospital setting and evaluate the extent of suboptimal reporting and risk of bias.   Materials and Methods A systematic search was performed (April 26, 2020) in EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane to identify chest radiographic, CT, or US studies in adult patients suspected of having COVID-19, using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test or clinical consensus as the standard of reference.  Two × two contingency tables were reconstructed, and test sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values were recalculated.  Reporting quality was evaluated by adherence to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD), and risk of bias was evaluated by adherence to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2).   Results Thirteen studies were eligible (CT = 12; chest radiography = 1; US = 0).  Recalculated CT sensitivity and specificity ranged between 0.57 and 0.97, and 0.37 and 0.94, respectively, and positive predictive values and negative predictive values ranged between 0.59 and 0.92 and 0.57 and 0.96, respectively.  On average, studies complied with only 35% of the STARD-guideline items.  No study scored low risk of bias for all QUADAS-2 domains (patient selection, index test, reference test, and flow and timing).  High risk of bias in more than one domain was scored in 10 of 13 studies (77%).   Conclusion Reported CT test accuracy for COVID-19 diagnosis varies substantially.  The validity and generalizability of these findings is complicated by poor adherence to reporting guidelines and high risk of bias, which are most likely due to the need for urgent publication of findings in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic.
COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Laboratory Findings, Comorbidities, and Clinical Outcomes Comparing Medical Staff versus the General Population This review compared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) laboratory findings, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes in patients from the general population versus medical staff to aid diagnosis of COVID-19 in a more timely, efficient, and accurate way. Electronic databases were searched up to 23rd March, 2020. The initial search yielded 6,527 studies. Following screening, 24 studies were included [18 studies (11,564 cases) of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the general public, and 6 studies (394 cases) in medical staff] in this review. Significant differences were observed in white blood cell counts (p &lt; 0.001), lymphocyte counts (p &lt; 0.001), platelet counts (p = 0.04), procalcitonin levels (p &lt; 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase levels (p &lt; 0.001), and creatinine levels (p = 0.03) when comparing infected medical staff with the general public. The mortality rate was higher in the general population than in medical staff (8% versus 2%). This review showed that during the early stages of COVID-19, laboratory findings alone may not be significant predictors of infection and may just accompany increasing C-reactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. In the symptomatic stage, the lymphocyte and platelet counts tended to decrease. Elevated D-dimer fibrin degradation product was associated with poor prognosis.
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Sex-Specific COVID-19 Clinical Outcomes To successfully mitigate the extraordinary devastation caused by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is crucial to identify important risk factors for this disease. One such neglected health determinant is the sex of the patient. This is an essential clinical characteristic, as it can factor into a patient's clinical management and preventative measures. Some clinical studies have shown disparities in the proportion between males and females that have more severe clinical outcomes or, subsequently, die from this disease. However, this association has not been unequivocally established. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the association between male sex and COVID-19 severity. We systematically reviewed the literature, identified studies that matched predetermined selection criteria, and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the proportion of males among four disease severity categories. Appropriate assessment strategies were implemented to assess and minimize potential biases. The results of this meta-analysis indicated that males constituted a significantly higher proportion of those who had adverse clinical outcomes and died from COVID-19. As the coronavirus spread from the East to the West, male sex remained a consistent risk factor. Our results support the establishment of the male sex as an important risk factor for this disease. Early identification and appropriate medical care for males with lab-confirmed COVID-19 may substantially change the course of clinical prognosis, resulting in greater numbers of lives saved.
Clinical Outcomes of Early Versus Late Tracheostomy in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Background: A significant proportion of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Tracheostomy is increasingly performed when a prolonged course of IMV is anticipated. Objectives: To determine clinical and resource utilization benefits of early versus late tracheostomy among COVID-19 patients. Methods: Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Embase were used to identify relevant studies comparing outcomes of COVID-19 patients undergoing early and late tracheostomy from January 1, 2020, to December 1, 2021. Results: Twelve studies were selected, and 2222 critically ill COVID-19 patients hospitalized between January to December 2020 were included. Among the included patients, 34.5% and 65.5% underwent early and late tracheostomy, respectively. Among the included studies, 58.3% and 41.7% defined early tracheostomy using cutoffs of 14 and 10 days, respectively. All-cause in-hospital mortality was not different between the early and late tracheostomy groups (32.9% vs. 33.1%; OR=1.00; P=0.98). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated a similar mortality rate in studies using a cutoff of 10 days (34.6% vs. 35.5%; OR=0.97; P=0.89) or 14 days (31.2% vs. 27.7%; OR=1.05; P=0.78). The early tracheostomy group had shorter ICU length of stay (LOS) (mean: 23.18 vs. 30.51 days; P < 0.001) and IMV duration (mean: 20.49 vs. 28.94 days; P < 0.001) than the late tracheostomy group. The time from tracheostomy to decannulation was longer (mean: 23.36 vs. 16.24 days; P=0.02) in the early tracheostomy group than in the late tracheostomy group, but the time from tracheostomy to IMV weaning was similar in both groups. Other clinical characteristics, including age, were similar in both groups. Conclusions: Early tracheostomy reduced the ICU LOS and IMV duration among COVID-19 patients compared with late tracheostomy, but the mortality rate was similar in both groups. The findings have important implications for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, especially in a resource-limited setting
Association Between Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With COVID-19 A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis ca
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients represent a vulnerable population that may be susceptible to more severe COVID-19. Moreover, not only the underlying NAFLD may influence the progression of COVID-19, but the COVID-19 may affect the clinical course of NAFLD as well.  However, comprehensive evidence on clinical outcomes in patients with NAFLD is not well characterized.   Objectives To systematically review and meta-analysis the evidence on clinical outcomes in NAFLD patients with COVID-19. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central were searched from inception through November 2020. Epidemiological studies assessing the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with NAFLD were included.  Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess study quality.  Generic inverse variance method using RevMan was used to determine the pooled estimates using the random-effects model.   Results Fourteen studies consisting of 1851 NAFLD patients, were included.  Significant heterogeneity was observed among the studies, and studies were of moderate to high quality [mean, (range):8 (6, 8)].  For NAFLD patients, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for the severe COVID-19 was 2.60 (95%CI:2.24–3.02; p &lt; 0.001) (studies,n:8), aOR for admission to ICU due to COVID-19 was 1.66 (95%CI:1.26–2.20; p &lt; 0.001) (studies,n:2), and aOR for mortality for was 1.01 (95%CI:0.65–1.58; p = 0.96) (studies,n:2).   Conclusions An increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection and admission to ICU due to COVID-19 with no difference in mortality was observed between NAFLD and non-NAFLD patients.  Future studies should include the mortality outcome to conclusively elucidate the impact of NAFLD in patients with COVID-19.
Epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care facilities: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care facilities (ACFs) often have devastating consequences.  However, epidemiologically these outbreaks are not well defined.  We aimed to define such outbreaks in ACFs by systematically reviewing literature published during the current COVID-19 pandemic.   Methods We searched 11 bibliographic databases for literature published on COVID-19 in ACFs between December 2019 and September 2020. Original studies reporting extractable epidemiological data as part of outbreak investigations or non-outbreak surveillance of ACFs were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis.  PROSPERO registration: CRD42020211424. Findings We identified 5,148 publications and selected 49 studies from four continents reporting data on 214,380 residents in 8,502 ACFs with 25,567 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Aged care residents form a distinct vulnerable population with single-facility attack rates of 45% [95% CI 32–58%] and case fatality rates of 23% [95% CI 18–28%].  Of the cases, 31% [95% CI 28–34%] were asymptomatic.  The rate of hospitalization amongst residents was 37% [95% CI 35–39%].  Data from 21 outbreaks identified a resident as the index case in 58% of outbreaks and a staff member in 42%.  Findings from the included studies were heterogeneous and of low to moderate quality in risk of bias assessment.   Interpretation The clinical presentation of COVID-19 varies widely in ACFs residents, from asymptomatic to highly serious cases.  Preventing the introduction of COVID-19 into ACFs is key, and both residents and staff are a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination.  Rapid diagnosis, identification of primary and secondary cases and close contacts plus their isolation and quarantine are of paramount importance.

Autopsy in COVID-19: what the clinician can learn from the dead? A systematic review protocol Importance: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated cardiac injury has been postulated secondary to several mechanisms. While tissue diagnosis is limited during the acute illness, postmortem studies can help boost our understanding and guide management.
Relative sensitivity of anterior nares, mid-turbinate and nasopharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2: rapid review Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are considered “gold standard” for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections, but anterior nares or mid-turbinate swabs (nasal swabs) are often used. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the sensitivity of nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs against a composite reference standard for the initial diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ambulatory patients. The study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020221827). Data sources included studies appearing between January 1, 2020 and March 20, 2021, identified by searches of PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. Studies included at least 20 subjects who simultaneously provided nasal and nasopharyngeal specimens for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, and for which confusion matrices could be constructed. Authors individually assessed studies for inclusion and compared assessments. Each author independently extracted all data elements; differences were reconciled by review of initial data sources. Extracted data included specimen site, patient characteristics, collection site, and confusion matrices comparing results for nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs. Assessed against a composite reference standard, anterior nares swabs are less sensitive (82% - 88%) than nasopharyngeal swabs (98%). For populations with 10% specimen positivity, the negative predictive values of all swab types were greater than 98%. Mid-turbinate and anterior nares swabs seem to perform similarly. The lower sensitivity associated with nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is justified by the ability to screen more patients and reduced personal protective equipment requirements. Our conclusions are limited by the small number of studies and the significant heterogeneity of study designs and study outcomes.
Does metformin affect outcomes in COVID-19 patients with new or pre-existing diabetes mellitus? A systematic review and meta-analysis Aims The COVID?19 pandemic is a global public health emergency and patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are disproportionately affected, exhibiting more severe outcomes.  Recent studies have shown that metformin is associated with improved outcomes in patients with COVID?19 and DM and may be a potential candidate for drug repurposing.  We aimed to investigate the effects of metformin on outcomes in patients with COVID?19 and DM.   Methods Databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Clinicaltrials.  gov and Cochrane library) were searched up to 10 April 2021 for studies reporting data on metformin use in COVID?19 patients with DM.  The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale.  Certainty of evidence was rated using the GRADE approach.  The primary outcome was mortality reported as odds ratio (OR).  A random?effects meta?analysis was carried out on both unadjusted and adjusted ORs.  This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020221842. Results In total, 2 916 231 patients from 32 cohort studies were included in the quantitative and qualitative synthesis.  The meta?analysis showed that metformin was significantly associated with lower mortality in COVID?19 patients with DM in both unadjusted (OR 0.61 [95% confidence interval: 0.53–0.71], P &lt; .  00001, I 2 = 70%) and adjusted (OR 0.78 [95% confidence interval: 0.69–0.88], P &lt; .  00001, I 2 = 67%) models.   Conclusion Poor outcomes in COVID?19 patients with DM can be attributed to inadequate glycaemic control and weakened immune responses.  Metformin has multiple effects that can improve outcomes in patients with DM and our findings highlight a possible role of its use.  However, robust randomised trials are needed to thoroughly assess its use.
Predicting mortality in severe COVID-19: a systematic review of the literature and external validation of clinical prediction rules for mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection Multiple prediction models for risk of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 have been developed, but not applied, to patient cohorts different to those from which they were derived. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science (WOS) databases were searched. Risk of bias and applicability were assessed with PROBAST. Nomograms, whose variables were available in a well-defined cohort of 444 patients from our site, were externally validated. Overall, 71 studies, which derived a clinical prediction rule for mortality outcome from COVID-19, were identified. Predictive variables consisted of combinations of patients? age, chronic conditions, dyspnea/taquipnea, radiographic chest alteration, and analytical values (LDH, CRP, lymphocytes, D-dimer); and markers of respiratory, renal, liver, and myocardial damage, which were mayor predictors in several nomograms. Twenty-five models could be externally validated. Areas under receiver operator curve (AUROC) in predicting mortality ranged from 0.71 to 1 in derivation cohorts; C-index values ranged from 0.823 to 0.970. Overall, 37/71 models provided very-good-to-outstanding test performance. Externally validated nomograms provided lower predictive performances for mortality in their respective derivation cohorts, with the AUROC being 0.654 to 0.806 (poor to acceptable performance). We can conclude that available nomograms were limited in predicting mortality when applied to different populations from which they were derived.
Effect of timing of intubation on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of non-randomized cohort studies Background id="Par1">Although several international guidelines recommend early over late intubation of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this issue is still controversial.  We aimed to investigate the effect (if any) of timing of intubation on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 by carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis.   Methods id="Par2">PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched, while references and preprint servers were explored, for relevant articles up to December 26, 2020, to identify studies which reported on mortality and/or morbidity of patients with COVID-19 undergoing early versus late intubation.  “Early” was defined as intubation within 24 h from intensive care unit (ICU) admission, while “late” as intubation at any time after 24 h of ICU admission.  All-cause mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) were the primary outcomes of the meta-analysis.  Pooled risk ratio (RR), pooled mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model.  The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020222147).   Results id="Par3">A total of 12 studies, involving 8944 critically ill patients with COVID-19, were included.  There was no statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality between patients undergoing early versus late intubation (3981 deaths; 45.4% versus 39.1%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99–1.15, p = 0.08).  This was also the case for duration of MV (1892 patients; MD ? 0.58 days, 95% CI ? 3.06 to 1.89 days, p = 0.65).  In a sensitivity analysis using an alternate definition of early/late intubation, intubation without versus with a prior trial of high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive mechanical ventilation was still not associated with a statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality (1128 deaths; 48.9% versus 42.5%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.99–1.25, p = 0.08).   Conclusions id="Par4">The synthesized evidence suggests that timing of intubation may have no effect on mortality and morbidity of critically ill patients with COVID-19. These results might justify a wait-and-see approach, which may lead to fewer intubations.  Relevant guidelines may therefore need to be updated.

The divergent protective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a systematic review and meta-analysis Background: Some studies have speculated that patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are more susceptible to adverse outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of administering ACEIs and ARBs to patients with COVID-19. Methods: Studies of COVID-19 were collected from the PubMed, Embase, medRxiv and BioRxiv databases. The pooled relative risk odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. Subgroup analyses were conducted by medication (ACEIs and ARBs) and geographical location (China and outside China). Inter-study heterogeneity was assessed using meta-regression. Begg’s test, Egger’s test and funnel plots were adopted to evaluate possible publication bias. Results: Thirty studies containing 10,434 adult patients were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled result indicated that the administration of ACEIs or ARBs reduced the risk of severe/death outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, a significant reduction in the risk of severe/death outcomes was observed to be associated with the administration of ACEIs or ARBs among COVID-19 patients in China, but this association was weaker for studies outside China. Furthermore, ACEI therapy was found to carry a significantly lower risk of an adverse clinical outcome. Discussion: Our systematic review and meta-analysis found that neither ACEIs nor ARBs worsen the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. On the contrary, we found that patients treated with ACEIs or ARBs have a reduced risk of severe/death outcomes, especially in Asia. Furthermore, ACEIs may reduce the risk of severe/death outcomes. Therefore, treatment interruption of ACEI or ARB therapy during COVID-19 infection is not recommended
Effect of sofosbuvir-based treatment on clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the efficacy of sofosbuvir-based antiviral treatment against COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials. gov were searched from inception to 15 August 2021. Studies comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir-based antiviral regimens (study group) with other antivirals or standard of care (control group) in patients with COVID-19 were included. Overall, 687 patients with COVID-19 were included, of which 377 patients received sofosbuvir-based treatment. Mortality was lower in the study group than in the control group [odds ratio (OR) = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30–0.79; I2 = 0%]. The overall clinical recovery rate was higher in the study group than in the control group (OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.20–2.76; I2 = 28%). The study group presented a lower requirement for mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.13–0.89; I2 = 0%) and intensive care unit admission (OR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.25–0.70; I2 = 0%) than the control group. Furthermore, the study group exhibited a shorter hospital length of stay [mean deviation (MD), –1.49, 95% CI –2.62 to –0.37; I2 = 56%] and recovery time (MD, –1.34, 95% CI –2.29 to –0.38; I2 = 46%) than the control group. Sofosbuvir-based treatment may help reduce mortality in patients with COVID-19 and improve associated clinical outcomes. Furthermore, sofosbuvir-based treatment was as safe as the comparator in patients with COVID-19. However, further large-scale studies are warranted to validate these findings.
Corticosteroid use in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical outcomes Background id="Par1">In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been worldwide debate on the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. In the recent RECOVERY trial, evaluating the effect of dexamethasone, a reduced 28-day mortality in patients requiring oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation was shown.  Their results have led to considering amendments in guidelines or actually already recommending corticosteroids in COVID-19. However, the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids still remain uncertain, and reliable data to further shed light on the benefit and harm are needed.   Objectives id="Par2">The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids in COVID-19. Methods id="Par3">A systematic literature search of RCTS and observational studies on adult patients was performed across Medline/PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from December 1, 2019, until October 1, 2020, according to the PRISMA guidelines.  Primary outcomes were short-term mortality and viral clearance (based on RT-PCR in respiratory specimens).  Secondary outcomes were: need for mechanical ventilation, need for other oxygen therapy, length of hospital stay and secondary infections.   Results id="Par4">Forty-four studies were included, covering 20.197 patients.  In twenty-two studies, the effect of corticosteroid use on mortality was quantified.  The overall pooled estimate (observational studies and RCTs) showed a significant reduced mortality in the corticosteroid group (OR 0.72 (95%CI 0.57–0.87).  Furthermore, viral clearance time ranged from 10 to 29 days in the corticosteroid group and from 8 to 24 days in the standard of care group.  Fourteen studies reported a positive effect of corticosteroids on need for and duration of mechanical ventilation.  A trend toward more infections and antibiotic use was present.   Conclusions id="Par5">Our findings from both observational studies and RCTs confirm a beneficial effect of corticosteroids on short-term mortality and a reduction in need for mechanical ventilation.  And although data in the studies were too sparse to draw any firm conclusions, there might be a signal of delayed viral clearance and an increase in secondary infections.
The Impact of Dementia on the Clinical Outcome of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Background: The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought large challenges to dementia patients. We reviewed the existing literature on COVID-19 to assess the incidence and mortality of dementia comorbidities in COVID-19 patients.  Objective: To investigate the impact of pre-existing dementia comorbidities on COVID-19.  Methods: We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for patients with preexisting dementia who were diagnosed with COVID-19. The statistical data on the prevalence and mortality of dementia comorbidities were examined. A fixed-or random-effect model was used to calculate the overall pooled risk estimates. Forest plots were generated to show the summarized results.  Results: A total of 265 articles were retrieved from the three databases. After removing duplicates and performing two screenings, 10 articles were selected for meta-analysis, including 119,218 participants. Overall, the meta-analysis of the 10 studies showed that the incidence of dementia in COVID-19 patients was (R: 9%, [95% CI: 6% to 13%]). Moreover, the meta-analysis of 9 studies showed that the mortality rate of individuals with dementia after being infected with COVID-19 was higher than that of individuals with no dementia (OR: 5.17 [95% CI: 2.31 to 11.59]). Substantial heterogeneity was observed in this meta-analysis. Significant publication bias was also found.  Conclusion: Emerging literature shows that dementia comorbidities are a high risk factor for the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. Our results should have an impact on preventive interventions and encourage more targeted approaches to prioritize older people with specific risk factors, such as dementia.
Ethnicity and clinical outcomes in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis Background Patients from ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the relationship between ethnicity and clinical outcomes in COVID-19.  Methods Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PROSPERO, Cochrane library and MedRxiv) were searched up to 31st August 2020, for studies reporting COVID-19 data disaggregated by ethnicity. Outcomes were: risk of infection; intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission and death. PROSPERO ID: 180654.  Findings 18,728,893 patients from 50 studies were included; 26 were peer-reviewed; 42 were from the United States of America and 8 from the United Kingdom. Individuals from Black and Asian ethnicities had a higher risk of COVID-19 infection compared to White individuals. This was consistent in both the main analysis (pooled adjusted RR for Black: 2.02, 95% CI 1.67–2.44; pooled adjusted RR for Asian: 1.50, 95% CI 1.24–1.83) and sensitivity analyses examining peer-reviewed studies only (pooled adjusted RR for Black: 1.85, 95%CI: 1.46–2.35; pooled adjusted RR for Asian: 1.51, 95% CI 1.22–1.88). Individuals of Asian ethnicity may also be at higher risk of ITU admission (pooled adjusted RR 1.97 95% CI 1.34–2.89) (but no studies had yet been peer-reviewed) and death (pooled adjusted RR/HR 1.22 [0.99–1.50]).  Interpretation Individuals of Black and Asian ethnicity are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection compared to White individuals; Asians may be at higher risk of ITU admission and death. These findings are of critical public health importance in informing interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality amongst ethnic minority groups.
Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Its Effect on Renal System, A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has infected millions worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein uses Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for entering and fusing the host cell membrane. However, interaction with spike protein receptors and protease processing are not the only factors determining coronaviruses’ entry. Several proteases mediate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus into the host cell. Identifying receptor factors helps understand tropism, transmission, and pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection in humans. The paper aims to identify novel viral receptor or membrane proteins that are transcriptionally and biologically similar to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 through a fuzzy clustering technique that employs the Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm for finding the optimal cluster center. The exploratory and exploitation capability of GWO algorithm is improved by hybridizing mutation and crossover operators of the evolutionary algorithm. Also, the genetic diversity of the grey wolf population is enhanced by eliminating weak individuals from the population. The proposed clustering algorithm’s effectiveness is shown by detecting novel viral receptors and membrane proteins associated with the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The expression profiles of ACE2 protein and its co-receptor factor are analyzed and compared with single-cell transcriptomics profiling using the Seurat R toolkit, mass spectrometry (MS), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Our advanced clustering method infers that cell that expresses high ACE2 level are more affected by SARS-CoV-infection. So, SARS-CoV-2 virus affects lung, intestine, testis, heart, kidney, and liver more severely than brain, bone marrow, skin, spleen, etc.
The possibility and cause of relapse after previously recovered from COVID-19: a systematic review The severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) is a novel coronavirus that is believed to be mainly transmitted via droplet and contact transmission. While research is focusing on epidemiology, transmission, vaccine development, and therapeutics for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is a possibility of disease relapse. There are reports of patients who tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 after clinical recovery and initial clearance of the virus.
The use of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review Background In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic with a viral infection called COVID-19. The disease usually causes respiratory symptoms but in a small proportion of patients can lead to a pneumonitis, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and death. Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) is considered a life-saving treatment for COVID-19 patients and a huge demand for IMV devices was reported globally. This review aims to provide insight on the initial IMV practices for COVID-19 patients in the initial phase of the pandemic.  Methods Electronic databases (Embase and MEDLINE) were searched for applicable articles using relevant keywords. The references of included articles were hand searched. Articles that reported the use of IMV in adult COVID-19 patients were included in the review. The NIH quality assessment tool for cohort and cross-sectional studies was used to appraise studies.  Results 106 abstracts were identified from the databases search, of which 16 were included. 4 studies were included in the meta-analysis. In total, 9988 patients were included across all studies. The overall cases of COVID-19 requiring IMV ranged from 2–75%. Increased age and pre-existing comorbidities increased the likelihood of IMV requirement. The reported mortality rate in patients receiving IMV ranged between 50–100%. On average, IMV was required and initiated between 10–10.5 days from symptoms onset. When invasively ventilated, COVID-19 patients required IMV for a median of 10–17 days across studies. Little information was provided on ventilatory protocols or management strategies and were inconclusive.  Conclusion In these initial reporting studies for the first month of the pandemic, patients receiving IMV were older and had more pre-existing co-morbidities than those who did not require IMV. The mortality rate was high in COVID-19 patients who received IMV. Studies are needed to evaluate protocols and modalities of IMV to improve outcomes and identify the populations most likely to benefit from IMV.
A rapid systematic review of non-invasive ventilation for the care of patients infected with COVID-19 Background: Mechanical ventilation is used to treat respiratory failure in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).   Purpose: To review multiple streams of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of ventilation techniques for coronavirus infections, including that causing COVID-19. (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020178187) Data Sources: 21 standard, World Health Organization–specific and COVID-19–specific databases, without language restrictions, until 1 May 2020. Study Selection: Studies of any design and language comparing different oxygenation approaches in patients with coronavirus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or with hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Animal, mechanistic, laboratory, and preclinical evidence was gathered regarding aerosol dispersion of coronavirus.  Studies evaluating risk for virus transmission to health care workers from aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were included.   Data Extraction: Independent and duplicate screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment (GRADE for certainty of evidence and AMSTAR 2 for included systematic reviews).   Data Synthesis: 123 studies were eligible (45 on COVID-19, 70 on SARS, 8 on MERS), but only 5 studies (1 on COVID-19, 3 on SARS, 1 on MERS) adjusted for important confounders.  A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very low-certainty evidence).  Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence).  Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy.  Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs.   Limitation: Direct studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported.   Conclusion: Indirect and low-certainty evidence suggests that use of NIV, similar to IMV, probably reduces mortality but may increase the risk for transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.   Primary Funding Source: World Health Organization.
COVID-19 infection risk to rescuers treating cardiac arrest Background There may be a risk of COVID-19 transmission to rescuers delivering treatment for cardiac arrest.  The aim of this review was to identify the potential risk of transmission associated with key interventions (chest compressions, defibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to inform international treatment recommendations.   Methods We undertook a systematic review comprising three questions: (1) aerosol generation associated with key interventions; (2) risk of airborne infection transmission associated with key interventions; and (3) the effect of different personal protective equipment strategies.  We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization COVID-19 database on 24th March 2020. Eligibility criteria were developed individually for each question.  We assessed risk of bias for individual studies, and used the GRADE process to assess evidence certainty by outcome.   Results We included eleven studies: two cohort studies, one case control study, five case reports, and three manikin randomised controlled trials.  We did not find any direct evidence that chest compressions or defibrillation either are or are not associated with aerosol generation or transmission of infection.  Data from manikin studies indicates that donning of personal protective equipment delays treatment delivery.  Studies provided only indirect evidence, with no study describing patients with COVID-19. Evidence certainty was low or very low for all outcomes.   Conclusion It is uncertain whether chest compressions or defibrillation cause aerosol generation or transmission of COVID-19 to rescuers.  There is very limited evidence and a rapid need for further studies.
Effect of convalescent blood products for patients with severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology: a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine whether convalescent blood products (CBPs) offer a survival advantage for patients with severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology.  Methods: Up-to-date trials were identi?ed by the authors through searches of the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and medRxiv databases from inception up to September 14, 2020. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model.  Results: According to the observational studies, patients who received CBPs showed a decline in all-cause mortality compared with patients who did not receive CBPs (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.56; p < 0.00001). However, the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed no difference between the intervention group and the control group regarding all-cause mortality (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57-1.19; p = 0.30). The use of CBPs did not increase the risk of adverse events (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60-1.29; p = 0.51). Using CBPs earlier compared with using CBPs later was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08-0.40; p < 0.0001).  Conclusions: Based on the outcomes of RCTs, CBPs may not decrease all-cause mortality. Furthermore, compared with later initiation of CBP therapy, earlier initiation of this therapy may decrease the rate of mortality.   • Convalescent blood product therapy has been one of the central interventions against COVID-19.
COVID-19 in pregnancy: systematic review and meta-analysis of larger case series OBJECTIVE:  To ascertain the frequency of maternal and neonatal complications, as well as maternal disease severity, in pregnancies affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.  DATA SOURCES:  MEDLINE, Ovid, ClinicalTrials.gov, MedRxiv, and Scopus were searched from their inception until April 29, 2020. The analysis was limited to reports with at least 10 pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that reported on maternal and neonatal outcomes.  METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION:  Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A systematic search of the selected databases was performed by implementing a strategy that included the MeSH terms, key words, and word variants for “coronavirus,” “SARS-CoV-2,” “COVID-19,” and “pregnancy.r The primary outcomes were maternal admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), critical disease, and death. Secondary outcomes included rate of preterm birth, cesarean delivery, vertical transmission, and neonatal death. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages with number of cases and 95% CIs.  TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS:  Of the 99 articles identified, 13 included 538 pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, with reported outcomes on 435 (80.9%) deliveries. Maternal ICU admission occurred in 3.0% of cases (8/263, 95% CI 1.6–5.9) and maternal critical disease in 1.4% (3/209, 95% CI 0.5–4.1). No maternal deaths were reported (0/348, 95% CI 0.0–1.1). The preterm birth rate was 20.1% (57/284, 95% CI 15.8–25.1), the cesarean delivery rate was 84.7% (332/392, 95% CI 80.8–87.9), the vertical transmission rate was 0.0% (0/310, 95% CI 0.0–1.2), and the neonatal death rate was 0.3% (1/313, 95% CI 0.1–1.8).  CONCLUSION:  With data from early in the pandemic, it is reassuring that there are low rates of maternal and neonatal mortality and vertical transmission with SARS-CoV-2. The preterm birth rate of 20% and the cesarean delivery rate exceeding 80% seems related to geographic practice patterns.
The novel 2019 coronavirus (nCoV) infection in humans: a systematic review protocol A growing body of literature on the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is becoming available, but a synthesis of available data has not been conducted. We performed a scoping review of currently available clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and chest imaging data related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, Scopus and LILACS from 01 January 2019 to 24 February 2020. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted using the clinical and laboratory data, and random-effects models were applied to estimate pooled results. A total of 61 studies were included (59,254 patients). The most common disease-related symptoms were fever (82%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 56%–99%; n = 4410), cough (61%, 95% CI 39%–81%; n = 3985), muscle aches and/or fatigue (36%, 95% CI 18%–55%; n = 3778), dyspnea (26%, 95% CI 12%–41%; n = 3700), headache in 12% (95% CI 4%–23%, n = 3598 patients), sore throat in 10% (95% CI 5%–17%, n = 1387) and gastrointestinal symptoms in 9% (95% CI 3%–17%, n = 1744). Laboratory findings were described in a lower number of patients and revealed lymphopenia (0.93 × 109/L, 95% CI 0.83–1.03 × 109/L, n = 464) and abnormal C-reactive protein (33.72 mg/dL, 95% CI 21.54–45.91 mg/dL; n = 1637). Radiological findings varied, but mostly described ground-glass opacities and consolidation. Data on treatment options were limited. All-cause mortality was 0.3% (95% CI 0.0%–1.0%; n = 53,631). Epidemiological studies showed that mortality was higher in males and elderly patients. The majority of reported clinical symptoms and laboratory findings related to SARS-CoV-2 infection are non-specific. Clinical suspicion, accompanied by a relevant epidemiological history, should be followed by early imaging and virological assay.
Reducing stigma and discrimination associated with Covid-19: rapid review Aims To develop recommendations for strategies and interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), through reviewing and synthesising evidence in relation to COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks and infectious/stigmatised conditions from systematic reviews and primary studies and recommendations from additional materials.   Methods Rapid review, drawing on the World Health Organization's (WHO) methodology for developing interim guidelines during health emergencies.  PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central and Campbell Collaboration searched up to mid-April 2020. Searches were supplemented by reference-searching and expert recommendations.  Searches were designed to identify: (1) systematic reviews (&lt;10 years), or (2) primary intervention studies (no date limit) reporting evidence on anti-stigma interventions (in relation to COVID-19 or other infectious/stigmatised conditions) or (3) additional relevant materials.  Data were extracted on population, intervention, outcome and results.  These data were compiled into evidence summary tables and narrative overviews.  Recommendations on strategies for COVID-19 stigma-reduction were developed using the WHO ‘Evidence to Decision’ framework approach.  The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (registration ID: CRD42020177677).   Results The searches identified a total of 4150 potentially relevant records, from which 12 systematic reviews and 29 additional articles were included.  Overarching considerations and specific recommendations focus on: (1) language/words used in relation to COVID-19 and affected people; (2) media/journalistic practices; (3) public health interventions; (4) targeted public health interventions for key groups and (5) involving communities and key stakeholders.   Conclusions These recommendations represent the first consolidated evidence-based guidance on stigma and discrimination reduction in relation to COVID-19. Mitigating the impact of stigma is critical in reducing distress and negative experiences, and strengthening communities' resolve to work together during exceptional circumstances.  Ultimately, reducing stigma helps addressing structural inequalities that drive marginalisation and exacerbate both health risks and the impact of stigma.  Administrations and decision makers are urged to consider integrating these recommendations into the ongoing COVID-19 response.
Psychological consequences of COVID-19 amongst affected individuals, healthcare workers and the general population A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted to examine the overall prevalence of psychological health outcomes during COVID-19. Seven databases were systematically searched to include studies reporting on at least one psychological outcome. The pooled prevalence of primary psychological outcomes was 26% (95%CI: 21–32). Pooled prevalence for symptoms of PTSD was 33% (0–86), anxiety 28% (21–36), stress 27% (14–43), and depression 22% (13–33). The prevalence of psychological outcomes was similar in healthcare workers and in the general population (34% [24–44] and 33% [27–40] respectively). High prevalence figures support the importance of ensuring adequate provision of resources for mental health.
The accuracy of chest X-ray, CT and ultrasound for the diagnosis of patients with suspected COVID-19 in a hospital setting: a systematic review and meta-analysis Purpose To synthesize the literature on diagnostic test accuracy of chest radiography, CT, and US for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients suspected of having COVID-19 in a hospital setting and evaluate the extent of suboptimal reporting and risk of bias.   Materials and Methods A systematic search was performed (April 26, 2020) in EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane to identify chest radiographic, CT, or US studies in adult patients suspected of having COVID-19, using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test or clinical consensus as the standard of reference.  Two × two contingency tables were reconstructed, and test sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values were recalculated.  Reporting quality was evaluated by adherence to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD), and risk of bias was evaluated by adherence to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2).   Results Thirteen studies were eligible (CT = 12; chest radiography = 1; US = 0).  Recalculated CT sensitivity and specificity ranged between 0.57 and 0.97, and 0.37 and 0.94, respectively, and positive predictive values and negative predictive values ranged between 0.59 and 0.92 and 0.57 and 0.96, respectively.  On average, studies complied with only 35% of the STARD-guideline items.  No study scored low risk of bias for all QUADAS-2 domains (patient selection, index test, reference test, and flow and timing).  High risk of bias in more than one domain was scored in 10 of 13 studies (77%).   Conclusion Reported CT test accuracy for COVID-19 diagnosis varies substantially.  The validity and generalizability of these findings is complicated by poor adherence to reporting guidelines and high risk of bias, which are most likely due to the need for urgent publication of findings in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Rate of intensive care unit admission and outcomes among patients with corona viruses: systemic review and meta-analysis Background The rate of ICU admission among patients with coronavirus varied from 3% to 100% and the mortality was as high as 86% of admitted patients.  The objective of the systematic review was to investigate the rate of ICU admission, mortality, morbidity, and complications among patients with coronavirus.   Methods A comprehensive strategy was conducted in PubMed/Medline; Science direct and LILACS from December 2002 to May 2020 without language restriction.  The Heterogeneity among the included studies was checked with forest plot, ?2 test, I2 test, and the p-values.  All observational studies reporting rate of ICU admission, the prevalence of mortality and its determinants among ICU admitted patients with coronavirus were included and the rest were excluded Result A total of 646 articles were identified from different databases and 50 articles were selected for evaluation.  Thirty-seven Articles with 24983 participants were included.  The rate of ICU admission was 32% (95% CI: 26 to 38, 37 studies and 32, 741 participants).  The Meta-Analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of mortality in patients with coronavirus disease in ICU was 39% (95% CI: 34 to 43, 37 studies and 24, 983 participants).   Conclusion The Meta-Analysis revealed that approximately one-third of patients admitted to ICU with severe Coronavirus disease and more than thirty percent of patients admitted to ICU with a severe form of COVID-19 for better care died which warns the health care stakeholders to give attention to intensive care patients.   Registration This Systematic review and Meta-Analysis was registered in Prospero international prospective register of systemic reviews (CRD42020177095) on April 9/2020.
Clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics of children with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background: With the global spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), health care systems are facing formidable challenges. Scientists are conducting studies to explore this new disease, and numerous studies have been shared. However, the number of studies on children with COVID-19 is limited, and no meta-analysis of this group has been performed.
Impact of comorbidites on the disease course in SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread across the globe at unprecedented speed and is showing no signs of slowing down. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to significant health burden in infected patients especially in those with underlying comorbidities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between comorbidities and their role in the exacerbation of disease in COVID-19 patients leading to fatal outcomes. A systematic review was conducted using data from MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases published from 1 December 2019 to 15 September 2020. Fifty-three articles were included in the systematic review. Of those 53 articles, 8 articles were eligible for meta-analysis. Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus were identified to be the most prevalent comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Our meta-analysis showed that cancer, chronic kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were independently associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Chronic kidney disease was statistically the most prominent comorbidity leading to death. However, despite having high prevalence, obesity was not associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCE COVID-19 has plagued the world since it was first identified in December 2019. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analysis were limited by various factors such as the usage of non-peer reviewed data and were also limited by the lack of clinical data on a global scale. Comorbidities are frequently cited as risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, the degree to which specific comorbidities impact the disease is debatable. Our study selection involves a global reach and covers all comorbidities that were reported to be involved in the exacerbation of COVID-19 leading to fatal outcomes, which allows us to identify the specific comorbidities that have higher risk in patients. The study highlights COVID-19 high-risk groups. However, further research should focus on the status of comorbidities and prognosis in COVID-19 patients.
Incidence and prognostic associations of myocardial injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a systematic review and meta-analysis Background id="Par1">The clinical significance of cardiac troponin measurement in patients hospitalised for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is uncertain.  We investigated the prevalence of elevated troponins in these patients and its prognostic value for predicting mortality.   Methods id="Par2">Studies were identified by searching electronic databases and preprint servers.  We included studies of hospitalised covid-19 patients that reported the frequency of troponin elevations above the upper reference limit and/or the association between troponins and mortality.  Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models.   Results id="Par3">Fifty-one studies were included.  Elevated troponins were found in 20.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.8–25.0 %) of patients who received troponin test on hospital admission.  Elevated troponins on admission were associated with a higher risk of subsequent death (risk ratio 2.68, 95% CI 2.08–3.46) after adjusting for confounders in multivariable analysis.  The pooled sensitivity of elevated admission troponins for predicting death was 0.60 (95% CI 0.54–0.65), and the specificity was 0.83 (0.77–0.88).  The post-test probability of death was about 42% for patients with elevated admission troponins and was about 9% for those with non-elevated troponins on admission.  There was significant heterogeneity in the analyses, and many included studies were at risk of bias due to the lack of systematic troponin measurement and inadequate follow-up.   Conclusion id="Par4">Elevated troponins were relatively common in patients hospitalised for covid-19. Troponin measurement on admission might help in risk stratification, especially in identifying patients at high risk of death when troponin levels are elevated.  High-quality prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.

Acute cardiac injury in patients suffering from COVID-19 infection; a systematic review and meta-analysis Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been widespread since late December 2019, with several symptoms related to the upper and lower respiratory system. However, its cardiac manifestations are less frequently studied. We aimed to analyze the available COVID-19 data on acute cardiac injury, using troponin and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels.  Methods: We performed a systematic review on Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases until March 25, 2020. Relevant records reporting the incidence of acute cardiac injury as well as troponin and BNP levels were collected from published peer-reviewed articles with further analysis according to the clinical status of the patients (severe, non-severe, and death).  Results: Eleven records of 1394 individuals were included. The mean age of patients with acute cardiac injury was 56.6 ± 33.4 years (males: 54.3%). The incidence of acute cardiac injury was 15% (95% CI: 11, 20%). Further analysis revealed that dead or severe patients had significantly higher percentages of myocardial injury, compared to non-severe ones (peer-reviewed: 44%, 95% CI: 16, 74% vs. 24%, 95% CI: 15, 34% vs. 5%, 95% CI: 1, 12%, respectively). Mean total troponin was 10.23 pg/mL (95% CI: 5.98, 14.47), while 13% (95% CI: 8%, 18%) of patients had elevated levels. Mean BNP was 216.74 pg/mL (95% CI: 3.27, 430.20).  Conclusion: Acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients is more frequent than what was expected at the beginning of the outbreak. Meanwhile, further studies are needed to investigate the utility of cardiac biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic tools for long-term cardiac complications of this infection.
Meta-analysis of sociodemographic and clinical risk factors, laboratory parameters and treatments associated with higher mortality in COVID-19. Objective Risk factors for in-hospital mortality in confirmed COVID-19 patients have been summarized in numerous meta-analyses, but it is still unclear whether they vary according to the age, sex and health conditions of the studied populations.  This study explored these variables as potential mortality predictors.   Methods A systematic review was conducted by searching the MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases of studies available through July 27, 2020. The pooled risk was estimated with the odds ratio (p-OR) or effect size (p-ES) obtained through random-effects meta-analyses.  Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were applied to explore differences by age, sex and health conditions.  The MOOSE guidelines were strictly followed.   Results The meta-analysis included 60 studies, with a total of 51,225 patients (12,458 [24.3%] deaths) from hospitals in 13 countries.  A higher in-hospital mortality risk was found for dyspnoea (p-OR = 2.5), smoking (p-OR = 1.6) and several comorbidities (p-OR range: 1.8 to 4.7) and laboratory parameters (p-ES range: 0.3 to -2.6).  Age was the main source of heterogeneity, followed by sex and health condition.  The following predictors were more markedly associated with mortality in studies with patients with a mean age ?60 years: dyspnoea (p-OR = 4.3), smoking (p-OR = 2.8), kidney disease (p-OR = 3.8), hypertension (p-OR = 3.7), malignancy (p-OR = 3.7), diabetes (p-OR = 3.2), pulmonary disease (p-OR = 3.1), decreased platelet count (p-ES = -1.7), decreased haemoglobin concentration (p-ES = -0.6), increased creatinine (p-ES = 2.4), increased interleukin-6 (p-ES = 2.4) and increased cardiac troponin I (p-ES = 0.7).  On the other hand, in addition to comorbidities, the most important mortality predictors in studies with older patients were albumin (p-ES = -3.1), total bilirubin (p-ES = 0.7), AST (p-ES = 1.8), ALT (p-ES = 0.4), urea nitrogen (p-ES), C-reactive protein (p-ES = 2.7), LDH (p-ES = 2.4) and ferritin (p-ES = 1.7).  Obesity was associated with increased mortality only in studies with fewer chronic or critical patients (p-OR = 1.8).   Conclusion The prognostic effect of clinical conditions on COVID-19 mortality vary substantially according to the mean age of patients.   PROSPERO registration number CRD42020176595.
Maternal clinical characteristics and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women infected by coronavirus (COVID-19). A systematic review Objective To describe the maternal clinical characteristics, maternal and perinatal outcomes in COVID-19-positive pregnant women.   Methods Articles in all languages on the SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women were sought from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and LILACS; China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) and Wan Fang Data between December 1, 2019 and April 27, 2020. Bulletins and national reports were also searched.   Results From 12,168 retrieved articles, 143 were selected for full-text assessment; 33 for descriptive analyses, and 4 case-controls for meta-analysis.  In 322 infected pregnant women, aged 20–45 years, the most frequent maternal comorbidity was obesity (24.2%).  Forty-two (28.4%) were asymptomatic at admission.  Cough (n = 148,59.7%) and fever (n = 147,59.3%) were the most prevalent symptoms.  In the meta-analysis, fever (OR: 0.13,95% CI 0.05 to 0.36) and cough (0.26,95% CI 0.11 to 0.59) were lower in pregnant women with COVID-19 than non-pregnant women with COVID-19.195 (60.6%) delivered, and 125 (38.8%) remained pregnant during the study.  Cesarean was reported in 99 (50.8%) women and vaginal delivery in 64 (32.8%).  The main adverse obstetric outcome was premature birth (n = 37,18.9%).  Thirty patients (10.3%) with COVID-19-related complications required intensive care, one (0.3%) died.  SARS-CoV-2 was absent in breast milk, amniotic fluid, placenta or umbilical cord blood.   Conclusions The maternal clinical characteristics of COVID-19-positive pregnant include frequently fever and cough; however significantly less frequently than non-pregnant women with COVID-19. Iatrogenic preterm birth is the main adverse obstetric outcome.  Current data does not support vertical transmission in the third trimester.
Laboratory analysis and outcome for patients with COVID-19; a systematic review and meta-analysis Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) poses substantial challenges for health care systems.  With a vastly expanding amount of publications on COVID-19, clinicians need evidence synthesis to produce guidance for handling patients with COVID-19. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examine which routine laboratory tests are associated with severe COVID-19 disease.   Content PubMed (Medline), Scopus, and Web of Science were searched until the 22nd of March 2020 for studies on COVID-19. Eligible studies were original articles reporting on laboratory tests and outcome of patients with COVID-19. Data were synthesised and we conducted random effects meta-analysis and estimated mean difference (MD) and standard mean difference at biomarker level for disease severity.  Risk of bias and applicability concern was evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies -2. Summary 45 studies were included, of which 21 publications were used for the meta-analysis.  Studies were heterogeneous, but had low risk of bias and applicability concern in terms of patient selection and reference standard.  Severe disease was associated with higher white blood cell count (MD 1.28 x 109/L), neutrophil count (MD 1.49 x 109/L), C-reactive protein (MD 49.2 mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (MD 196 U/L), D-dimer (SMD 0.58), and aspartate aminotransferase (MD 8.5 U/L), all p &lt; 0.001. Furthermore, low lymphocyte count (MD -0.32 x 109/L), platelet count (MD -22.4 x 109/L), and haemoglobin (MD -4.1 g/L), all p &lt; 0.001, were also associated with severe disease.  In conclusion, several routine laboratory tests are associated with disease severity in COVID-19.
Efficacy and safety of lianhua qingwen for COVID-19: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis Background Lianhuaqingwen (LH) has been proven effective for influenza.  However, the promotion of LH for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 remains controversial.  Therefore, our study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Lianhuaqingwen (LH) in treating patients with COVID-19 by a systematic review and meta-analysis.   Methods We conducted the literature search using six electronic databases from December 1, 2019, to June 2, 2020. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials.  Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of case control studies.  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality checklist was used to assess the quality of case series.  All analyses were conducted by RevMan 5.3. For outcomes that could not be meta-analyzed were performed a descriptive analysis.   Results Eight studies with 924 patients were included.  Three studies were RCTs, three were case control studies, and two were case series.  The quality of the included studies was poor.  Compared with patients treated by conventional treatment, patients treated by LH combined with conventional treatment have a higher overall effective rate (RR = 1.16, 95%CIs: 1.04?1.30, P = 0.01) and CT recovery rate (RR=1.21, 95%CIs: 1.02?1.43, P = 0.03).  Patients of LH groups have a lower incidence of diarrhea (5.6% vs.  13.4%), and have statistically significant (P = 0.026).  But the rate of abnormal liver function in the combined medication group is higher than that in the single LH group.   Conclusion LH combined with conventional treatment seems to be more effective for patients with mild or ordinary COVID-19.
The COVID-19 controversy over non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): a systematic review and meta-analysis of NSAIDs in adult acute lower respiratory tract infections Aims In light of the recent safety concerns relating to NSAID use in COVID-19, we sought to evaluate cardiovascular and respiratory complications in patients taking NSAIDs during acute lower respiratory tract infections.  Methods We carried out a systematic review of randomised controlled trials and observational studies. Studies of adult patients with short-term NSAID use during acute lower respiratory tract infections, including bacterial and viral infections, were included. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular, renal and respiratory complications.  Results In total, eight studies including two randomised controlled trials, three retrospective and three prospective observational studies enrolling 44 140 patients were included. Five of the studies were in patients with pneumonia, two in patients with influenza, and one in a patient with acute bronchitis. Meta-analysis was not possible due to significant heterogeneity. There was a trend towards a reduction in mortality and an increase in pleuro-pulmonary complications. However, all studies exhibited high risks of bias, primarily due to lack of adjustment for confounding variables. Cardiovascular outcomes were not reported by any of the included studies.  Conclusion In this systematic review of NSAID use during acute lower respiratory tract infections in adults, we found that the existing evidence for mortality, pleuro-pulmonary complications and rates of mechanical ventilation or organ failure is of extremely poor quality, very low certainty and should be interpreted with caution. Mechanistic and clinical studies addressing the captioned subject are urgently needed, especially in relation to COVID-19.
The effect of comorbid pulmonary diseases on the severity of COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and continues to spread worldwide. Persistent questions remain about the relationship between the severity of COVID?19 and comorbid diseases, as well as other chronic pulmonary conditions. In this systematic review and meta?analysis, we aimed to examine in detail whether the underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), asthma and chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) were associated with an increased risk of more severe COVID?19. A comprehensive literature search was performed using five international search engines. In the initial search, 722 articles were identified. After eliminating duplicate records and further consideration of eligibility criteria, 53 studies with 658,073 patients were included in the final analysis. COPD was present in 5.2% (2191/42,373) of patients with severe COVID?19 and in 1.4% (4203/306,151) of patients with non?severe COVID?19 (random?effects model; OR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.99–3.34, Z = 7.15, p &lt; 0.001). CRD was present in 8.6% (3780/44,041) of patients with severe COVID?19 and in 5.7% (16,057/280,447) of patients with non?severe COVID?19 (random?effects model; OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.74–2.64, Z = 7.1, p &lt; 0.001). Asthma was present in 2.3% (1873/81,319) of patients with severe COVID?19 and in 2.2% (11,796/538,737) of patients with non?severe COVID?19 (random?effects model; OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.79–1.60, Z = 0.66, p = 0.50). In conclusion, comorbid COPD and CRD were clearly associated with a higher severity of COVID?19; however, no association between asthma and severe COVID?19 was identified.
Case fatality rates for COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation: a meta-analysis Rationale: Initial reports of case fatality rates (CFRs) among adults with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) are highly variable.  Objectives: To examine the CFR of patients with COVID-19 receiving IMV.  Methods: Two authors independently searched PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, bioRxiv, the COVID-19 living systematic review, and national registry databases. The primary outcome was the “reported CFR” for patients with confirmed COVID-19 requiring IMV. “Definitive hospital CFR” for patients with outcomes at hospital discharge was also investigated. Finally, CFR was analyzed by patient age, geographic region, and study quality on the basis of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.  Measurements and Results: Sixty-nine studies were included, describing 57,420 adult patients with COVID-19 who received IMV. Overall reported CFR was estimated as 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39–52%). Fifty-four of 69 studies stated whether hospital outcomes were available but provided a definitive hospital outcome on only 13,120 (22.8%) of the total IMV patient population. Among studies in which age-stratified CFR was available, pooled CFR estimates ranged from 47.9% (95% CI, 46.4–49.4%) in younger patients (age ?40 yr) to 84.4% (95% CI, 83.3–85.4%) in older patients (age >80 yr). CFR was also higher in early COVID-19 epicenters. Overall heterogeneity is high (I2 >90%), with nonsignificant Egger’s regression test suggesting no publication bias.  Conclusions: Almost half of patients with COVID-19 receiving IMV died based on the reported CFR, but variable CFR reporting methods resulted in a wide range of CFRs between studies. The reported CFR was higher in older patients and in early pandemic epicenters, which may be influenced by limited ICU resources. Reporting of definitive outcomes on all patients would facilitate comparisons between studies.
Meta-analysis of sociodemographic and clinical risk factors, laboratory parameters and treatments associated with higher mortality in COVID-19. Objective Risk factors for in-hospital mortality in confirmed COVID-19 patients have been summarized in numerous meta-analyses, but it is still unclear whether they vary according to the age, sex and health conditions of the studied populations.  This study explored these variables as potential mortality predictors.   Methods A systematic review was conducted by searching the MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases of studies available through July 27, 2020. The pooled risk was estimated with the odds ratio (p-OR) or effect size (p-ES) obtained through random-effects meta-analyses.  Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were applied to explore differences by age, sex and health conditions.  The MOOSE guidelines were strictly followed.   Results The meta-analysis included 60 studies, with a total of 51,225 patients (12,458 [24.3%] deaths) from hospitals in 13 countries.  A higher in-hospital mortality risk was found for dyspnoea (p-OR = 2.5), smoking (p-OR = 1.6) and several comorbidities (p-OR range: 1.8 to 4.7) and laboratory parameters (p-ES range: 0.3 to -2.6).  Age was the main source of heterogeneity, followed by sex and health condition.  The following predictors were more markedly associated with mortality in studies with patients with a mean age ?60 years: dyspnoea (p-OR = 4.3), smoking (p-OR = 2.8), kidney disease (p-OR = 3.8), hypertension (p-OR = 3.7), malignancy (p-OR = 3.7), diabetes (p-OR = 3.2), pulmonary disease (p-OR = 3.1), decreased platelet count (p-ES = -1.7), decreased haemoglobin concentration (p-ES = -0.6), increased creatinine (p-ES = 2.4), increased interleukin-6 (p-ES = 2.4) and increased cardiac troponin I (p-ES = 0.7).  On the other hand, in addition to comorbidities, the most important mortality predictors in studies with older patients were albumin (p-ES = -3.1), total bilirubin (p-ES = 0.7), AST (p-ES = 1.8), ALT (p-ES = 0.4), urea nitrogen (p-ES), C-reactive protein (p-ES = 2.7), LDH (p-ES = 2.4) and ferritin (p-ES = 1.7).  Obesity was associated with increased mortality only in studies with fewer chronic or critical patients (p-OR = 1.8).   Conclusion The prognostic effect of clinical conditions on COVID-19 mortality vary substantially according to the mean age of patients.   PROSPERO registration number CRD42020176595.
Health-related challenges and coping strategies among women during COVID-19 and other pandemics: a systematic narrative review Equality and empowerment for women are among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 5). Although women were confronted with more challenges in various ways during pandemics; however, there is hardly any systematic synthesis of evidence on women's health-related challenges during pandemics. We reviewed the health challenges faced by women during the pandemic. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL following PRISMA guidelines. We identified 2,831 studies, of which we included 17. Reproductive health, psychosocial health, and gender-based violence emerged as significant challenges. Many studies reported challenges in provisions for routine services and increased anxiety, fear, and stress among women. The findings highlighted that pandemic have a significant impact on women's health. Women must have equal rights and opportunities without discrimination, which requires urgent action to enhance women's rights and to achieve SDGs. Women engagement/involvement in pandemic-related services needs to be explored, which will aid in developing strategies to alleviate vulnerabilities.
Prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder caused by COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background As one of the most widely researched consequence of traumatic events, the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak varies greatly across studies.  This review aimed at examining the pooled prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak.   Methods Systematic searches of databases were conducted for literature published on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, PsycArticle, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure until October 14, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed using R software (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020180309).   Results A total of 106,713 people exposed to the trauma resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak were identified in the 76 articles, of which 33,810 were reported with post-traumatic stress symptoms.  The pooled prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak was 28.34%, with a 95% confidence interval of 23.03-34.32%.  Subgroup analysis indicated that older age, male and bigger sample size were associated with higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms.  After controlling for other factors, the results of meta-regression showed that the influence of gender and sample size on prevalence is no longer significant.   Conclusions Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were very common among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak.  Further research is needed to explore more possible risk factors for post-traumatic stress symptoms and identify effective strategies for preventing PTSD-related symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak.
Comparison of the cardiovascular presentations, complications and outcomes following different corona viruses’ infection, a systematic review Manifestations caused by coronavirus family have presented it in many ways during the previous years. The aim of this systematic review was to gather all possible cardiovascular manifestations of the coronavirus family in the literature. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane and ProQuest which were updated on May 1, 2020 for the last time. Regarding to the novelty and speed of publications on COVID-19, we searched Google Scholar and also references of included studies and review articles in the systematic search results were searched manually. The searched keywords were the combination of the following MeSH terms: "COVID-19", "SARS", "MERS" and "cardiovascular presentation". The systematic review was registered with ID CRD42020180736 in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). After screening, 28 original articles and ten case studies (five case reports and five case series) were included. Most of the studies were focused on COVID-19 (20 original articles and four case studies) while the only studies about Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) were a case report and a case series. Almost all the cardiovascular presentations and complications including acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias and the thrombotic complications were more prevalent in COVID-19 than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS. The cardiac injury was the most common cardiovascular presentation and complication in COVID-19 whereas thrombotic complications were commonly reported in SARS. The cardiac injury was the predictor of disease severity and mortality in both COVID-19 and SARS. Coronavirus 2019 may present with cardiovascular manifestations and complications in signs and symptoms, laboratory data and other paraclinical findings. Also, cardiovascular complications in the course of COVID-19 may result in worse outcomes.
Clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ICU admission: a systematic review and meta analysis Objectives Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a major cause of hospital admission and represents a challenge for patient management during intensive care unit (ICU) stay.  We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in critically ill patients.   Methods We performed a systematic search of peer-reviewed publications in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library up to 15th August 2020. Preprints and reports were also included if they met the inclusion criteria.  Study eligibility criteria were full-text prospective, retrospective or registry-based publications describing outcomes in patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19, using a validated test.  Participants were critically ill patients admitted in the ICU with COVID-19 infection.   Results From 32 articles included, a total of 69 093 patients were admitted to the ICU and were evaluated.  Most patients included in the studies were male (76 165/128 168, 59%, 26 studies) and the mean patient age was 56 (95%CI 48.5–59.8) years.  Studies described high ICU mortality (21 145/65 383, 32.3%, 15 studies).  The median length of ICU stay was 9.0 (95%CI 6.5–11.2) days, described in five studies.  More than half the patients admitted to the ICU required mechanical ventilation (31 213/53 465, 58%, 23 studies) and among them mortality was very high (27 972/47 632, 59%, six studies).  The duration of mechanical ventilation was 8.4 (95%CI 1.6–13.7) days.  The main interventions described were the use of non-invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy and vasopressors.   Conclusions This systematic review, including approximately 69 000 ICU patients, demonstrates that COVID-19 infection in critically ill patients is associated with great need for life-sustaining interventions, high mortality, and prolonged length of ICU stay.
SARS-associated genetic variants of the host influencing the COVID-19 phenotype (SaGe-HP): a rapid review id="Par1">The COVID-19 pandemic has strengthened the interest in the biological mechanisms underlying the complex interplay between infectious agents and the human host. The spectrum of phenotypes associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, ranging from the absence of symptoms to severe systemic complications, raised the question as to what extent the variable response to coronaviruses (CoVs) is influenced by the variability of the hosts’ genetic background.
Suicide during COVID-19 and other major international respiratory outbreaks: A systematic review Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was recently declared a pandemic by the WHO. This outbreak threatens not only physical health but also has significant repercussions on mental health. In recent world history, major infectious outbreaks were associated with severe mental health sequelae, including suicide. In this study, we systematically review the literature on suicidal outcomes during major international respiratory outbreaks, including COVID-19. We reviewed descriptive and analytic articles addressing suicide during major international respiratory outbreaks. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases and then utilized an independent method for study selection by a pair of reviewers. Two reviewers completed data abstraction and conducted a narrative summary of the findings. Our search generated 2,153 articles. Nine studies (three descriptive, five analytical, and one with mixed methodology) were eligible. The included studies were heterogeneous, divergent in methods, and with a low degree of evidence. Deducing an association between pandemics, suicide, and suicide-related outcomes remains thus poorly supported. Future research with better methodological characteristics, the use of longitudinal studies, and a focus on suicide as the primary outcome would allow for an in-depth understanding and formulation of the scope of this problem.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in solid organ transplantation: systematic review Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly progresses to severe acute respiratory syndrome. This review aimed at collating available data on COVID-19 infection in solid organ transplantation (SOT) patients.  We performed a systematic review of SOT patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The MEDLINE and PubMed databases were electronically searched and updated until April 20, 2020. The MeSH terms used were “COVID-19” AND “Transplant.”  Thirty-nine COVID-19 cases were reported among SOT patients. The median interval for developing SARS-CoV-2 infection was 4 years since transplantation, and the fatality rate was 25.64% (10/39). Sixteen cases were described in liver transplant (LT) patients, and the median interval since transplantation was 5 years. The fatality rate among LT patients was 37.5% (6/16), with death occurring more than 3 years after LT. The youngest patient who died was 59 years old; there were no deaths among children. Twenty-three cases were described in kidney transplant (KT) patients. The median interval since transplantation was 4 years, and the fatality rate was 17.4% (4/23). The youngest patient who died was 71 years old. Among all transplant patients, COVID-19 had the highest fatality rate in patients older than 60 years : LT, 62.5% vs 12.5% (p=0.006); KT 44.44% vs 0 (p=0.039); and SOT, 52.94% vs 4.54% (p=0.001).  This study presents a novel description of COVID-19 in abdominal SOT recipients. Furthermore, we alert medical professionals to the higher fatality risk in patients older than 60 years.

Mental health conditions of healthcare professionals dealing with COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Introduction: The psychological impact of COVID-19 on health-care workers (HCWs) has received attention from researchers to understand the extent of the effects of the ongoing pandemic on this population.  The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the currently available literature on the topic to determine the prevalence of mental health problems in HCWs.   Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases for articles published from December 2019 to August 15, 2020. We identified studies reporting the prevalence of any mental health condition in HCWs involved directly or indirectly in providing services during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The prevalence proportion for individual outcome was extracted as an estimate of interest.  We performed random-effects meta-analyses evaluated using Q statistic, I2 statistic, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses and assessed study quality.  This review was done in adherence to the Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.  The study protocol was registered prospectively at PROSPERO (CRD42020182005).   Results: We identified 1958 studies, of which 33 studies including 39703 participants (with a median = 393; range = 88–14825) were finally included for analysis.  The estimated overall prevalence were as follows: depression 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.9–39.3, I2 = 99%), anxiety 32.5% (95% CI: 26.4–39.0, I2 = 99%), insomnia or sleep disturbance 36.6% (95% CI: 36.6–48.3, I2 = 99%), and stress 37.7% (95% CI: 24.0–52.3, I2 = 100%).   Conclusion: HCWs who are dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic have a significant prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia and poor sleep quality, and stress.  The health-care workforce needs to practice self-care now more than ever, while health-care managers and policymakers need to factor in the mental health consequences of COVID-19 on their workforce.
A rapid review of the evidence of the types and effects of misinformation on COVID-19 on social media Objective To review misinformation related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on social media during the first phase of the pandemic and to discuss ways of countering misinformation.   Methods We searched PubMed®, Scopus, Embase®, PsycInfo and Google Scholar databases on 5 May 2020 and 1 June 2020 for publications related to COVID-19 and social media which dealt with misinformation and which were primary empirical studies.  We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses and the guidelines for using a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews.  Evidence quality and the risk of bias of included studies were classified using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation approach.  The review is registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42020182154).   Findings We identified 22 studies for inclusion in the qualitative synthesis.  The proportion of COVID-19 misinformation on social media ranged from 0.2% (413/212 846) to 28.8% (194/673) of posts.  Of the 22 studies, 11 did not categorize the type of COVID-19-related misinformation, nine described specific misinformation myths and two reported sarcasm or humour related to COVID-19. Only four studies addressed the possible consequences of COVID-19-related misinformation: all reported that it led to fear or panic.   Conclusion Social media play an increasingly important role in spreading both accurate information and misinformation.  The findings of this review may help health-care organizations prepare their responses to subsequent phases in the COVID–19 infodemic and to future infodemics in general.
Effectiveness and Safety of Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine as a mono-therapy or in combination with Azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 patients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis id="Par1">Many recent studies have investigated the role of either Chloroquine (CQ) or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) alone or in combination with azithromycin (AZM) in the management of the emerging coronavirus. This systematic review and meta-analysis of either published or preprint observational studies or randomized control trials (RCT) aimed to assess mortality rate, duration of hospital stay, need for mechanical ventilation (MV), virologic cure rate (VQR), time to a negative viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR), radiological progression, experiencing drug side effects, and clinical worsening. A search of the online database through June 2020 was performed and examined the reference lists of pertinent articles for in-vivo studies only. Pooled relative risks (RRs), standard mean differences of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with the random-effects model. Mortality was not different between the standard care (SC) and HCQ groups (RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.61–1.59, I2 = 82%), meta-regression analysis proved that mortality was significantly different across the studies from different countries. However, mortality among the HCQ + AZM was significantly higher than among the SC (RR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.19–2.27, I2 = 70%). The duration of hospital stay in days was shorter in the SC in comparison with the HCQ group (standard mean difference = 0.57, 95% CI 0.20–0.94, I2 = 92%), or the HCQ + AZM (standard mean difference = 0.77, 95% CI 0.46–1.08, I2 = 81). Overall VQR, and that at days 4, 10, and 14 among patients exposed to HCQ did not differ significantly from the SC [(RR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.69–1.23, I2 = 67%), (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.26–4.69, I2 = 85%), (RR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.70–2.01, I2 = 95%), and (RR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.76–1.27, I2 = 85% )] respectively. Exposure to HCQ + AZM did not improve the VQR as well (RR = 3.23, 95% CI 0.70–14.97, I2 = 58%). The need for MV was not significantly different between the SC and HCQ (RR = 1.5, 95% CI 0.78–2.89, I2 = 81%), or HCQ + AZM (RR = 1.27, 95% CI 0.7–2.13, I2 = 88%). Side effects were more reported in the HCQ group than in the SC (RR = 3.14, 95% CI 1.58–6.24, I2 = 0). Radiological improvement and clinical worsening were not statistically different between HCQ and SC [(RR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.74–1.65, I2 = 45%) and (RR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.33–4.99), I2 = 54%] respectively. Despite the scarcity of published data of good quality, the effectiveness and safety of either HCQ alone or in combination with AZM in treating COVID-19 cannot be assured. Future high-quality RCTs need to be carried out.
Association between vitamin D supplementation or serum vitamin D level and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 including clinical course, morbidity and mortality outcomes? A systematic review Objective To systemically review and critically appraise published studies of the association between vitamin D supplementation or serum vitamin D level and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19, including clinical course, morbidity and mortality outcomes.   Design Systematic review.   Data sources MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MedRxiv and BioRxiv preprint databases.  COVID-19 databases of the WHO, Cochrane, CEBM Oxford and Bern University up to 10 June 2020. Study selection Studies that assessed vitamin D supplementation and/or low serum vitamin D in patients acutely ill with, or at risk of, severe betacoronavirus infection (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2).   Data extraction Two authors independently extracted data using a predefined data extraction form and assessed risk of bias using the Downs and Black Quality Assessment Checklist.   Results Searches elicited 449 papers, 59 studies were eligible full-text assessment and 4 met the eligibility criteria of this review.  The four studies were narratively synthesised and included (1) a cross-sectional study (n=107) suggesting an inverse association between serum vitamin D and SARS-CoV-2; (2) a retrospective cohort study (348 598 participants, 449 cases) in which univariable analysis showed that vitamin D protects against COVID-19; (3) an ecological country level study demonstrating a negative correlation between vitamin D and COVID-19 case numbers and mortality; and (4) a case–control survey (n=1486) showing cases with confirmed/probable COVID-19 reported lower vitamin D supplementation.  All studies were at high/unclear risk of bias.   Conclusion There is no robust evidence of a negative association between vitamin D and COVID-19. No relevant randomised controlled trials were identified and there is no robust peer-reviewed published evidence of association between vitamin D levels and severity of symptoms or mortality due to COVID-19. Guideline producers should acknowledge that benefits of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 are as yet unproven despite increasing interest.
A rapid review of the perioperative management of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 Background Current guidelines for perioperative management of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) are mainly based on extrapolated evidence or expert opinion. We aimed to systematically investigate how COVID-19 affects perioperative management and clinical outcomes, to develop evidence-based guidelines. Methods First, we conducted a rapid literature review in EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (January 1 to July 1, 2020), using a predefined protocol. Second, we performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 166 women undergoing Caesarean section at Tongji Hospital, Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic, imaging, laboratory, and clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. Results The review identified 26 studies, mainly case reports/series. One large cohort reported greater mortality in elective surgery patients diagnosed after, rather than before surgery. Higher 30 day mortality was associated with emergency surgery, major surgery, poorer preoperative condition and surgery for malignancy. Regional anaesthesia was favoured in most studies and personal protective equipment (PPE) was generally used by healthcare workers (HCWs), but its use was poorly described for patients. In the retrospective cohort study, duration of surgery, oxygen therapy and hospital stay were longer in suspected or confirmed patients than negative patients, but there were no differences in neonatal outcomes. None of the 262 participating HCWs was infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) when using level 3 PPE perioperatively. Conclusions When COVID-19 is suspected, testing should be considered before non-urgent surgery. Until further evidence is available, HCWs should use level 3 PPE perioperatively for suspected or confirmed patients, but research is needed on its timing and specifications. Further research must examine longer-term outcomes.
Obesity as a predictor for a poor prognosis of COVID-19: a systematic review Background and aims COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic due to droplet infection of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).  Due to its rapid transmission and high case-fatality rate, recognition of its risk and prognostic factor is important.  Obesity has been associated with impaired immune system, increasing the susceptibility for 2019-nCoV infection.  We aimed to study the impact of obesity to the prognosis and disease severity of COVID-19. Methods A systematic search and handsearching was conducted in four databases: Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed.  The identified articles were screened using the chosen eligibility criteria.  We obtained three retrospective cohort studies (Wu J et al.  , Lighter J et al.  , and Simonnet A et al.  ) to be critically appraised using Newcastle Ottawa Scale.   Results The findings of all included studies were consistent in stating the contribution of obesity as a risk factor to increase the requirement for advanced medical care.  Study with the highest quality, Simonnet A et al.  , reported an increase need of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with body mass index higher than 35 kg/m2, OR: 7.36 (1.63–33.14; p = 0.021).  This is associated with a higher mortality rate in obese population infected with COVID-19. Conclusion Obesity is an independent risk and prognostic factor for the disease severity and the requirement of advanced medical care in COVID-19. This systematic review highlights a particularly vulnerable group – obese, and emphasises on the importance of treatment aggression and disease prevention in this population group.
Oral manifestations in patients with COVID-19: a living systematic review This living systematic review aims to summarize evidence on the prevalence of oral signs and symptoms in patients with COVID-19. The review was reported per the PRISMA checklist, and the literature search was conducted in 6 databases and in gray literature. Studies published in any language mentioning oral symptoms and signs in patients with COVID-19 were included. The risk of bias was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools. The certainty of evidence was evaluated through GRADE assessment. After a 2-step selection, 40 studies were included: 33 cross-sectional and 7 case reports. Overall, 10,228 patients (4,288 males, 5,770 females, and 170 unknown) from 19 countries were assessed. Gustatory impairment was the most common oral manifestation, with a prevalence of 45% (95% CI, 34% to 55%; I2 = 99%). The pooled eligible data for different taste disorders were 38% for dysgeusia and 35% for hypogeusia, while ageusia had a prevalence of 24%. Taste disorders were associated with COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 12.68; 95% CI, 6.41 to 25.10; I2 = 63%; P < 0.00001), mild/moderate severity (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.25 to 3.49; I2 = 66%; P = 0.005), and female patients (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.17; I2 = 70%; P = 0.0007). Oral mucosal lesions presented multiple clinical aspects, including white and erythematous plaques, irregular ulcers, small blisters, petechiae, and desquamative gingivitis. Tongue, palate, lips, gingiva, and buccal mucosa were affected. In mild cases, oral mucosal lesions developed before or at the same time as the initial respiratory symptoms; however, in those who required medication and hospitalization, the lesions developed approximately 7 to 24 d after onset symptoms. Therefore, taste disorders may be common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and should be considered in the scope of the disease's onset and progression. Oral mucosal lesions are more likely to present as coinfections and secondary manifestations with multiple clinical aspects (PROSPERO CRD42020184468).
Efficacy and safety of corticosteroid in treatment of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background COVID-19 is a type of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that was identified in December 2019. Corticosteroid therapy was empirically used for clinical treatment in the early stage of the disease outbreak; however, data regarding its efficacy and safety are controversial.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid therapy in patients with COVID-19. Methods The PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and China Science and Technology Journal (VIP) databases were searched for studies.  Data on clinical improvement, mortality, virus clearance time, adverse events (AEs), utilization of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization, and hospital stay were extracted by two authors independently.  Study quality was assessed by the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (cohort studies).  The pooled data were meta-analyzed using a random effects model, and the quality of evidence was rated using the GRADE approach.   Results Eleven cohort studies (corticosteroid group vs control group), two retrospective cohort studies (without control group), and seven case studies were identified.  A total of 2840 patients were included.  Compared with the control treatments, corticosteroid therapy was associated with clinical recovery (RR = 1.30, 95% CI [0.98, 1.72]) and a significantly shortened length of ICU hospitalization (RR = ?6.50; 95% CI [?7.63 to ?5.37]), but it did not affect the mortality ((RR = 1.59; 95% CI [0.69–3.66], I2 = 93.5%), utilization of mechanical ventilation (RR = 0.35; 95% CI [0.10, 1.18]), duration of symptoms (WMD = 1.69; 95% CI [?0.24 to 3.62]) or virus clearance time (RR = 1.01; 95% CI [?0.91 to 2.92], I2 = 57%) in COVID-19 patients.  Treatment with corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 may cause mild adverse outcomes.  The quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes.   Conclusion The findings of our study indicate that corticosteroid therapy is not highly effective, but it appears to improve prognosis and promote clinical recovery in patients with severe COVID-19.

Conclusion The findings of our study indicate that corticosteroid therapy is not highly effective, but it appears to improve prognosis and promote clinical recovery in patients with severe COVID-19.
Prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 recurrence in COVID-19 patients and its related characteristics: systematic review and meta-analysis id="Par1">Present study aimed to estimate the incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity after recovery from COVID-19 and to determine the factors associated with recurrent positivity. We searched the PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials. gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry for studies published to June 12, 2020. Studies were reviewed to determine the risk of bias. A random-effects model was used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Fourteen studies of 2568 individuals were included. The incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 14.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.44–18.19%). The pooled estimate of the interval from disease onset to recurrence was 35.4 days (95% CI 32.65–38.24 days), and from the last negative to the recurrent positive result was 9.8 days (95% CI 7.31–12.22 days). Patients with younger age and a longer initial illness were more likely to experience recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while patients with diabetes, severe disease, and a low lymphocyte count were less likely to experience. Present study concluded that the incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 14.8% suggesting further studies must be conducted to elucidate the possibility of infectious individuals with prolonged or recurrent RNA positivity.
A rapid review of Echinacea for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 and other respiratory tract infections in humans Brief overview Current evidence suggests that Echinacea supplementation may decrease the duration and severity of acute respiratory tract infections; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Few adverse events were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. Because Echinacea can increase immune function, there is a concern that it could worsen over-activation of the immune system in cytokine storm; however, clinical trials show that Echinacea decreases levels of immune molecules involved in cytokine storm.  Verdict Echinacea supplementation may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and the common cold, particularly when administered at the first sign of infection; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Previous studies have reported that Echinacea may decrease the severity and/or duration of ARI when taken at the onset of symptoms. The studies reporting benefit used E. purpurea or a combination of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia containing standardized amounts of active constituents.  Few adverse events from the use of Echinacea were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. No human trials could be located reporting evidence of cytokine storm when Echinacea was used for up to 4 months.  When assessing all human trials which reported changes in cytokine levels in response to Echinacea supplementation, the results were largely consistent with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the progression of cytokine storm and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), factors that play a significant role in the death of COVID-19 patients. While there is currently no research on the therapeutic effects of Echinacea in the management of cytokine storm, this evidence suggests that further research is warranted.
A Review of the Experiences of Implementing Population Testing for SARS-COV-2 Objectives The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) – also known as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) – pandemic has led to the swift introduction of population testing programmes in many countries across the world, using testing modalities such as drive-through, walk-through, mobile and home visiting programmes.  Here, we provide an overview of the literature describing the experience of implementing population testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).   Study design Scoping review.   Methods We conducted a scoping review using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane library in addition to a grey literature search.  We identified indicators relevant to process, quality and resource outcomes related to each testing modality.   Results In total, 2999 titles were identified from the academic literature and the grey literature search, of which 22 were relevant.  Most studies were from the USA and the Republic of Korea.  Drive-through testing centres were the most common testing modality evaluated and these provided a rapid method of testing whilst minimising resource use.   Conclusions The evidence base for population testing lacks high quality studies, however, the literature provides evaluations of the advantages and limitations of different testing modalities.  There is a need for robust evidence in this area to ensure that testing is deployed in a safe and effective manner in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
D-dimer levels on admission and in-hospital mortality risk of Covid-19 patients: A systematic review D-dimer level on admission is a promising biomarker to predict mortality in patients with COVID-19. In this study, we reviewed the association between on-admission D-dimer levels and all-cause mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. Peer-reviewed studies and preprints reporting categorised D-dimer levels on admission and all-cause mortality until 24 May 2020 were searched for using the following keywords: ‘COVID-19’, ‘D-dimer’ and ‘Mortality’. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the pooled risk ratio (RR) for all-cause mortality. In total, 2911 COVID-19 patients from nine studies were included in this meta-analysis. Regardless of the different D-dimer cut-off values used, the pooled RR for all-cause mortality in patients with elevated vs. normal on-admission D-dimer level was 4.77 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.02–7.54). Sensitivity analysis did not significantly affect the overall mortality risk. Analysis restricted to studies with 0.5 ?g/ml as the cut-off value resulted in a pooled RR for mortality of 4.60 (95% CI 2.72–7.79). Subgroup analysis showed that the pooled all-cause mortality risk was higher in Chinese vs. non-Chinese studies (RR 5.87; 95% CI 2.67–12.89 and RR 3.35; 95% CI 1.66–6.73; P = 0.29). On-admission D-dimer levels showed a promising prognostic role in predicting all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients, elevated D-dimer levels were associated with increased risk of mortality.
The association between smoking and COVID-19 disease progression Introduction Smoking depresses pulmonary immune function and is a risk factor contracting other infectious diseases and more serious outcomes among people who become infected.  This paper presents a meta-analysis of the association between smoking and progression of the infectious disease COVID-19. Methods PubMed was searched on April 28, 2020, with search terms “smoking”, “smoker*”, “characteristics”, “risk factors”, “outcomes”, and “COVID-19”, “COVID”, “coronavirus”, “sar cov-2”, “sar cov 2”.  Studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease were selected for the final analysis.  The study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people who already had the disease.  A random effects meta-analysis was applied.   Results We identified 19 peer-reviewed papers with a total of 11,590 COVID-19 patients, 2,133 (18.4%) with severe disease and 731 (6.3%) with a history of smoking.  A total of 218 patients with a history of smoking (29.8%) experienced disease progression, compared with 17.6% of non-smoking patients.  The meta-analysis showed a significant association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (OR 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-2.59, p = 0.001).  Limitations in the 19 papers suggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher.   Conclusions Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers.   Implications Physicians and public health professionals should collect data on smoking as part of clinical management and add smoking cessation to the list of practices to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic.
A systematic review of the prevalence and risk factors for anxiety, depression and fear of disease during the COVID-19 pandemic, and of strategies to address these Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on psychological well-being globally. Study aims were to examine the extent of psychological morbidity and to identify risk and protective factors that could be targeted with interventions. A systematic review was performed using PRISMA guidelines. Studies reporting depression, anxiety and COVID-related fear were included. 30 studies (43,634 participants) were included. Anxiety prevalence was 6.3–34% and depression 14.6%–43.7%. Higher levels of anxiety, depression and/or COVID-related fear were found in women, younger people, rural residents, areas with high rates of COVID-19 and people with poor general health. Quarantine and feeling overwhelmed with negative information were risk factors for COVID-related fear. Protective factors were: comfortable amount of information, good social support’ and confidence in doctor. Health professionals had high rates of psychological morbidity. Risk and protective factors were identified in this study. These could be targeted with COVID-specific public health support and interventions. What we already know a. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on psychological well-being globally. b. Rates of anxiety and/or depression over 35% have been reported during the pandemic. c. Responding to mental health issues is a priority area of public health policy. What this article adds a. Risk groups for psychological morbidity have been identified, including health professionals, young people, women, people affected by quarantine and those living in hot-spot and rural areas. b. Protective factors have also been identified, including good family and social supports, positive coronavirus news feeds and confidence in doctors. c. This information can be used to target strategies to support the mental health of communities affected by COVID-19
SARS-Cov-2 prevalence, transmission, health-related outcomes and control strategies in homeless shelters: systematic review and meta-analysis Background People experiencing homelessness (PEH) may be at risk for COVID19. We synthesised evidence on SARS-Cov-2 infection, transmission, outcomes of disease, effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and the effectiveness of strategies for infection prevention and control (IPC).   Methods Systematic review of articles, indexed in electronic databases (EMBASE, WHO—Covid19, Web of Science), institutional websites and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's live map of COVID-19 evidence, and published from December 1st, 2019, to March 3rd, 2021. Empirical papers of any study design addressing Covid-19 and health(-related) outcomes in PEH or shelters’ staff were included.  (PROSPERO-2020-CRD42020187033) Findings Of 536 publications, 37 studies were included (two modelling, 31 observational, four qualitative studies).  Random-effect meta-analysis yields a baseline SARS-Cov-2 prevalence of 2•32% (95% Confidence-Interval, 95%CI=1•30–3•34) in PEH and 1•55% (95%CI=0•79–2•31) in staff.  In outbreaks, the pooled prevalence increases to 31•59% (95%CI=20•48–42•71) in PEH and 14•80% (95%CI=10•73–18•87) in staff.  Main IPC strategies were universal rapid testing, expansion of non-congregate housing, and in-shelter measures (bed spacing, limited staff rotation, reduction in number of residents).   Interpretation 32% of PEH and 15% staff are infected during outbreaks of SARS-Cov-2 in homeless shelters.  Most studies were conducted in the USA.  No studies were found quantifying health-related outcomes of NPI.  Overview and evaluation of IPC strategies for PEH, a better understanding of disease transmission, and reliable data on PEH within Covid-19 notification systems are needed.  Qualitative studies may serve to voice PEH and shelter staff experiences, and guide future evaluations and IPC strategies.   Funding None.
Host genetic variants associated with COVID-19 prognosis and susceptibility: a systematic review and meta-analysis Biomarker identification may provide strategic opportunities to understand disease pathophysiology, predict outcomes, improve human health, and reduce healthcare costs. The highly heterogeneous Covid?19 clinical manifestation suggests a complex interaction of several different human, viral and environmental factors. Here, we systematically reviewed genetic association studies evaluating Covid?19 severity or susceptibility to SARS?CoV?2 infection following PRISMA recommendations. Our research comprised papers published until December 31st, 2020, in PubMed and BioRXiv databases focusing on genetic association studies with Covid?19 prognosis or susceptibility. We found 20 eligible genetic association studies, of which 11 assessed Covid?19 outcome and 14 evaluated infection susceptibility (five analyzed both effects). Q?genie assessment indicated moderate quality. Five large?scale association studies (GWAS, whole?genome, or exome sequencing) were reported with no consistent replication to date. Promising hits were found on the 3p21.31 region and ABO locus. Candidate gene studies examined ACE1, ACE2, TMPRSS2, IFITM3, APOE, Furin, IFNL3, IFNL4, HLA, TNF?? genes, and ABO system. The most evaluated single locus was the ABO, and the most sampled region was the HLA with three and five candidate gene studies, respectively. Meta?analysis could not be performed. Available data showed the need for further reports to replicate claimed associations.
Prevalence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has placed health care workers under psychological stress.  Previous reviews show a high prevalence of mental disorders among health care workers, but these need updating and inclusion of studies written in Chinese.  The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide updated prevalence estimates for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, benefitting from the inclusion of studies published in Chinese.   Methods Systematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar and the Chinese databases SinoMed, WanfangMed, CNKI and CQVIP, for studies conducted between December 2019 and August 2020 on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Studies published in both English and Chinese were included.   Results Data on the prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD was pooled across 65 studies involving 97,333 health care workers across 21 countries.  The pooled prevalence of depression was 21.7% (95% CI, 18.3%-25.2%), of anxiety 22.1% (95% CI, 18.2%-26.3%), and of PTSD 21.5% (95% CI, 10.5%-34.9%).  Prevalence estimates are also provided for a mild classification of each disorder.  Pooled prevalence estimates of depression and anxiety were highest in studies conducted in the Middle-East (34.6%; 28.9%).  Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted across covariates, including sampling method and outcome measure.   Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis has identified a high prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Appropriate support is urgently needed.  The response would benefit from additional research on which interventions are effective at mitigating these risks.
A rapid systematic review of transmission of betacoronaviruses between humans The COVID-19 pandemic has had far reaching implications for health, economics and society. One of the many areas affected has been the ability of healthcare professionals to stop the spread of the infection in health and care settings both in hospital and in the community such as a dental surgery. With research being published since the emergence of the outbreak we now have a much better understanding of how to help prevent the spread of the infection. This document was co-produced by a multiprofessional group that includes clinicians, nurses, academics, and a member of the public. It provides the current evidence with recommendations to help frontline health professionals and managers. The timing of this guidance is important, it is vital that people are aware what has been proven to work. We are aware that new evidence will come along which may contradict or add to some of our recommendations, however this is an important start in giving health providers and managers evidence-based recommendations for limiting the spread of infection. The document contains explanation, evidence and a glossary of terms (Appendix 1). If you simply want to look at the recommendations, please see the executive summary section. Along with this document we are publishing materials for patients, carers and members of the public because it is vital that we all have access to guidance and understand our individual role in reducing COVID-19 spread in hospitals and community.
Clinical epidemiology and outcome of ICU-admitted patients with or without mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients - a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis Background Insight into COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patient characteristics, rates and risks of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and associated outcomes as well as any regional discrepancies is critical in this pandemic for individual case management and overall resource planning.   Methods and findings Electronic searches were performed for reports through May 1 2020 and reports on COVID-19 ICU admissions and outcomes were included using predefined search terms.  Relevant data was subsequently extracted and pooled using fixed or random effects meta-analysis depending on heterogeneity.  Study quality was assessed by the NIH tool and heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and Q tests.  Baseline patient characteristics, ICU and IMV outcomes were pooled and meta-analyzed.  Pooled odds ratios (pOR) were calculated for clinical features against ICU, IMV mortality.  Subgroup analysis was carried out based on patient regions.  A total of twenty-eight studies comprising 12,437 COVID-19 ICU admissions from seven countries were meta-analyzed.  Pooled ICU admission rate was 21% [95% CI 0.12–0.34] and 69% of cases needed IMV [95% CI 0.61–0.75].  ICU and IMV mortality were 28.3% [95% CI 0.25–0.32], 43% [95% CI 0.29–0.58] and ICU, IMV duration was 7.78 [95% CI 6.99–8.63] and 10.12 [95% CI 7.08–13.16] days respectively.  Besides confirming the significance of comorbidities and clinical findings of COVID-19 previously reported, we found the major correlates with ICU mortality were IMV [pOR 16.46, 95% CI 4.37–61.96], acute kidney injury (AKI) [pOR 12.47, 95% CI 1.52–102.7], and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [pOR 6.52, 95% CI 2.66–16.01].  Subgroup analyses confirm significant regional discrepancies in outcomes.   Conclusions This is a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 ICU and IMV cases and associated outcomes.  The significant association of AKI, ARDS and IMV with mortality has implications for ICU resource planning for AKI and ARDS as well as suggesting the need for further research into optimal ventilation strategies for COVID-19 patients in the ICU setting.  Regional differences in outcome implies a need to develop region specific protocols for ventilatory support as well as overall treatment.
Prevalence of comorbidities in patients and in the fatal cases affected by COVID-19 The new coronavirus, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Risk factors associated with this disease are age, sex, and the presence of comorbidities, the most common being hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. The aim of this meta-analysis was to calculate the prevalence and geographical distribution of comorbidities in all patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), and the mortality rate of COVID-19. We selected studies based upon epidemiological and clinical descriptions of the patients and mortality from the disease to determine the pooled prevalence of comorbidities in all patients and in mortality cases due to COVID-19. The pooled prevalence was estimated using the random effects model, and odds ratios were used to measure the probability of death for a patient with a comorbidity. The total prevalence of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 was 42% (95% CI: 25-60), 61% (95% CI: 42-80) in those admitted to the ICU, and 77% (95% CI: 68-86) among death cases; males were the most affected. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity in all three groups studied, accounting for 32%, 26%, and 35%, respectively. The odds ratio of death for a patient with a comorbidity compared to one with no comorbidity was 2.4 (P &lt; 0.0001). The higher the prevalence of comorbidities the higher the odds that the COVID-19 patient will need intensive care or will die, especially if the pre-existing disease is hypertension, heart disease, or diabetes.
Venous thromboembolism in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background and aims Statin therapy is administered to patients with high cardiovascular risk.  These patients are also at risk for severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  Statins exhibit not only cardioprotective but also immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects.  This study performed a systematic review of published evidence regarding statin treatment and COVID-19 related mortality.   Methods A systematic PubMed/Embase search was performed from February 10, 2020 until March 05, 2021 for studies in COVID-19 patients that reported adjusted hazard or odds ratio for death in statin users versus non-users.   Results 22 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review.  Meta-analysis of 10 studies (n = 41,807, weighted age 56 ± 8 years, men 51%, hypertension 34%, diabetes 21%, statin users 14%) that reported adjusted hazard ratios for mortality in statin users versus non-users showed pooled estimate at 0.65 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.53, 0.81).  Meta-analysis of 6 studies that reported continuation of statin therapy during hospitalization (58–100% of patients) revealed a pooled hazard ratio of 0.54 (95% CI 0.47, 0.62).  Meta-analysis of 12 studies (n = 72,881, weighted age 65 ± 2 years, men 54%, hypertension 66%, diabetes 43%, statin users 30%) that reported adjusted odds ratios for mortality showed pooled estimate at 0.65 (95% CI 0.55, 0.78).  Multivariable meta-regression analysis did not reveal any significant association of hazard or odds ratios with anthropometric characteristics or comorbidities.   Conclusions This meta-analysis of retrospective observational studies showed that statin therapy was associated with an about 35% decrease in the adjusted risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
The prevalence of mental health disorders in university and college students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis The COVID-19 pandemic and its accompanying infection control measures introduced significant disruptions to the routines of many higher education students around the world. It also deprived them of in-person counselling services and social support. These changes have put students at a greater risk of developing mental illness. The objective of this review is to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances in higher education students during the pandemic. A systematic search of English and Chinese databases was conducted current to January 1st, 2021. The quality of included studies was evaluated using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Eighty-nine studies (n=1,441,828) were included. The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleep disturbances was 34%, 32% and 33%, respectively. The prevalence values differ based on geographical regions, diagnostic criteria, education level, undergraduate year of study, financial situation, living arrangements and gender. Overall, the prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms synthesized in this study was higher compared to pre-pandemic prevalence in similar populations. Evidently, mental health screening and intervention should be a top priority for universities and colleges during the pandemic.
The prevalence of depression, anxiety and sleep disorder in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis Evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks has shown that infected patients are at risk for developing psychiatric and mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. To construct a comprehensive picture of the mental health status in COVID?19 patients, we conducted a systematic review and random?effects meta?analysis to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances in this population. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Wanfang Data, Wangfang Med Online, CNKI, and CQVIP for relevant articles, and we included 31 studies (n = 5153) in our analyses. We found that the pooled prevalence of depression was 45% (95% CI: 37–54%, I 2 = 96%), the pooled prevalence of anxiety was 47% (95% CI: 37–57%, I 2 = 97%), and the pooled prevalence of sleeping disturbances was 34% (95% CI: 19–50%, I 2 = 98%). We did not find any significant differences in the prevalence estimates between different genders; however, the depression and anxiety prevalence estimates varied based on different screening tools. More observational studies assessing the mental wellness of COVID?19 outpatients and COVID?19 patients from countries other than China are needed to further examine the psychological implications of COVID?19 infections.
Nutritional screening tools used for identification of nutritional risk in older patients with COVID-19: a systematic review with narrative synthesis Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with high risk of malnutrition, primarily in older people; assessing nutritional risk using appropriate screening tools is critical. This systematic review identified applicable tools and assessed their measurement properties. Literature was searched in the MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS databases. Four studies conducted in China met the eligibility criteria. Sample sizes ranged from six to 182, and participants’ ages from 65 to 87 years. Seven nutritional screening and assessment tools were used: the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002), the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), the MNA-short form (MNA-sf), the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), the Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), the Geriatric NRI (GNRI), and modified Nutrition Risk in the Critically ill (mNUTRIC) score. Nutritional risk was identified in 27.5% to 100% of participants. The NRS-2002, MNA, MNA-sf, NRI, and MUST demonstrated high sensitivity; the MUST had better specificity. The MNA and MUST demonstrated better criterion validity. The MNA-sf demonstrated better predictive validity for poor appetite and weight loss; the NRS-2002 demonstrated better predictive validity for prolonged hospitalization. mNUTRIC score demonstrated good predictive validity for hospital mortality. Most instruments demonstrate high sensitivity for identifying nutritional risk, but none are acknowledged as the best for nutritional screening in older adults with COVID-19.
Home-based exercise programmes improve physical fitness of older adults: A PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis with relevance for COVID-19 This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of home-based exercise programmes on measures of physical-fitness in healthy older adults. Seventeen randomized-controlled trials were included with a total of 1,477 participants. Results indicated small effects of home-based training on muscle strength (between-study standardised-mean-difference [SMD] = 0.30), muscle power (SMD = 0.43), muscular endurance (SMD = 0.28), and balance (SMD = 0.28). We found no statistically significant effects for single-mode strength vs. multimodal training (e.g., combined balance, strength, and flexibility exercises) on measures of muscle strength and balance. Single-mode strength training had moderate effects on muscle strength (SMD = 0.51) and balance (SMD = 0.65) while multimodal training had no statistically significant effects on muscle strength and balance. Irrespective of the training type, >3 weekly sessions produced larger effects on muscle strength (SMD = 0.45) and balance (SMD = 0.37) compared with ?3 weekly sessions (muscle strength: SMD = 0.28; balance: SMD = 0.24). For session-duration, only ?30 min per-session produced small effects on muscle strength (SMD = 0.35) and balance (SMD = 0.34). No statistically significant differences were observed between all independently-computed single-training factors. Home-based exercise appears effective to improve components of health- (i.e., muscle strength and muscular endurance) and skill-related (i.e., muscle power, balance) physical-fitness. Therefore, in times of restricted physical activity due to pandemics, home-based exercises constitute an alternative to counteract physical inactivity and preserve/improve the health and fitness of healthy older adults aged 65-to-83 years.
Gender susceptibility in COVID-19 and outcomes: a meta-analysis Background Epidemiological differences between men and women have been reported with regards to sepsis, influenza and severe coronavirus infections including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.   Aim To systematically review the literature relating to men versus women on SARS-CoV-2 in order to seek differences in disease characteristics (e.  g.  infectivity, severity) and outcomes (e.  g.  mortality).   Methods We searched 3 electronic databases up or observational studies reporting differences between men and women in the SARS-CoV-2 disease characteristics stated.  We identified and included 47 studies, reporting data for 21,454 patients mainly from China.   Results The unadjusted mortality rates of men were higher than those of women, with a mortality OR 0.51 [0.42, 0.61] (p&lt;0.001) for women.  The proportion of men presenting with severe disease and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was also higher than that of women (OR 0.75 [0.60–0.93] p&lt;0.001 and OR 0.45 [0.40–0.52] p&lt;0.001 respectively).  Adjusted analyses could not be conducted due to lack of data.   Conclusion COVID-19 may be associated with worse outcomes in males than in females.  However, until more detailed data are provided in further studies enabling adjusted analysis, this remains an unproven assumption.
Exploring options for reprocessing of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (N95-FFRs) amidst COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review Background There is global shortage of Personal Protective Equipment due to COVID-19 pandemic.  N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) provide respiratory protection against respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2. There is scant literature on reprocessing methods which can enable reuse of N95-FFRs.   Aim We conducted this study to evaluate research done, prior to COVID-19 pandemic, on various decontamination methods for reprocessing of N95-FFRs.   Methods We searched 5 electronic databases (Pubmed, Google Scholar, Crossref, Ovid, ScienceDirect) and 1 Grey literature database (OpenGrey).  We included original studies, published prior to year 2020, which had evaluated any decontamination method on FFRs.  Studies had evaluated a reprocessing method against parameters namely physical changes, user acceptability, respirator fit, filter efficiency, microbicidal efficacy and presence of chemical residues post-reprocessing.   Findings and conclusions Overall, we found 7887 records amongst which 17 original research articles were finally included for qualitative analysis.  Overall, 21 different types of decontamination or reprocessing methods for N95-FFRs were evaluated.  Most commonly evaluated method for reprocessing of FFRs was Ultraviolet (Type-C) irradiation (UVGI) which was evaluated in 13/17 (76%) studies.  We found published literature was scant on this topic despite warning signs of pandemic of a respiratory illness over the years.  Promising technologies requiring expeditious evaluation are UVGI, Microwave generated steam (MGS) and based on Hydrogen peroxide vapor.  Global presence of technologies, which have been given Emergency use authorisation for N95-FFR reprocessing, is extremely limited.  Reprocessing of N95-FFRs by MGS should be considered for emergency implementation in resource limited settings to tackle shortage of N95-FFRs.   Systematic review identifier PROSPERO, PROSPERO ID: CRD42020189684, (https://www.  crd.  york.  ac.  uk/prospero/display_record.  php?ID=CRD42020189684).
Can immunity during pregnancy influence SARS-CoV-2 infection? A systematic review • Are there immunological differences in immune cells during pregnancy that influence COVID-19.
Biomarkers of cytokine storm as red flags for severe and fatal COVID-19 cases: a living systematic review and meta-analysis Objective To describe the laboratory parameters and biomarkers of the cytokine storm syndrome associated with severe and fatal COVID-19 cases.   Methods A search with standardized descriptors and synonyms was performed on November 28th, 2020 of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.  gov, LILACS, and IBECS to identify studies of interest.  Grey literature searches and snowballing techniques were additionally utilized to identify yet-unpublished works and related citations.  Two review authors independently screened the retrieved titles and abstracts, selected eligible studies for inclusion, extracted data from the included studies, and then assessed the risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.  Eligible studies were those including laboratory parameters—including serum interleukin-6 levels—from mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 cases.  Laboratory parameters, such as interleukin-6, ferritin, hematology, C-Reactive Protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, and D-dimer, were extracted from the studies.  Meta-analyses were conducted using the laboratory data to estimate mean differences with associated 95% confidence intervals.   Data synthesis The database search yielded 9,620 records; 40 studies (containing a total of 9,542 patients) were included in the final analysis.  Twenty-one studies (n = 4,313) assessed laboratory data related to severe COVID-19 cases, eighteen studies (n = 4,681) assessed predictors for fatal COVID-19 cases and one study (n = 548) assessed laboratory biomarkers related to severe and fatal COVID-19 cases.  Lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of interleukin-6, ferritin, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, C-Reactive-Protein, procalcitonin, creatinine, neutrophils and leucocytes were associated with severe and fatal COVID-19 cases.   Conclusions This review points to interleukin-6, ferritin, leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, C-Reactive Protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, and D-dimer as important biomarkers of cytokine storm syndrome.  Elevated levels of interleukin-6 and hyperferritinemia should be considered as red flags of systemic inflammation and poor prognosis in COVID-19.
Gastrointestinal symptoms and fecal nucleic acid testing of children with 2019 coronavirus disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis In order to understand the clinical manifestations and incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in children and discuss the importance of fecal nucleic acid testing.We retrospectively analyzed studies on gastrointestinal symptoms and fecal nucleic acid detection in pediatric COVID-19 patients from January 1, 2020 to August 10, 2020, including prospective clinical studies and case reports. The results of fecal nucleic acid detection were analyzed systematically. Stata12.0 software was used for meta-analysis.The results showed that the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in children with COVID-19 were vomiting and diarrhea, with a total incidence of 17.7% (95% Cl: 13.9%-21.5%). However, the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in other countries (21.1%, 95% CI: 16.5%-25.7%) was higher compared to China (12.9%, 95% CI: 8%-17.7%). In Wuhan, the pooled prevalence was much higher (41.3%, 95 % CI: 3.2%-79.4%) compared to areas outside Wuhan in China (7.1%, 95 % CI: 4.0%-10.3%).The positive rate of fecal nucleic acid testing in COVID-19 children was relatively high at 85.8% (91/106). Additionally, 71.2% (52/73) were still positive for fecal nucleic acid after respiratory tract specimens turned negative. One and two weeks after the respiratory tract specimens turned nucleic acid-negative, 45.2% (33/73) and 34.2% (25/73) patients, respectively, remained fecal nucleic acid-positive. The longest interval between the respiratory tract specimens turning negative and fecal specimens turning negative exceeded 70 days.Conclusions and Relevance:Gastrointestinal symptoms in pediatric COVID-19 are relatively common. Attention should be paid to the detection of fecal nucleic acids in children. Fecal nucleic acid-negative status should be considered as one of the desegregation standards.
Outcomes of mechanical ventilation among patients with COVID-19 adult respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background COVID 19 is the most recent cause of Adult respiratory distress syndrome ARDS.  Invasive mechanical ventilation IMV can support gas exchange in patients failing non-invasive ventilation, but its reported outcome is highly variable between countries.  We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on IMV for COVID-associated ARDS to study its outcome among different countries.   Methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were systematically searched up to August 8, 2020. Studies reporting five or more patients with end point outcome for severe COVID 19 infection treated with IMV were included.  The main outcome assessed was mortality.  Baseline, procedural, outcome, and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled with random-effect methods.  Subgroup analysis for different countries was performed.  Meta-regression for the effect of study timing and patient age and were tested.  Publication bias was examined.  This trial was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42020190365. Findings Our electronic search retrieved 4770 citations, 103 of which were selected for full-text review.  Twenty-one studies with a combined population of 37359 patients with COVID-19 fulfilled the inclusion criteria.  From this population, 5800 patients were treated by invasive mechanical ventilation.  Out of those, 3301 patients reached an endpoint of ICU discharge or death after invasive mechanical ventilation while the rest were still in the ICU.  Mortality from IMV was highly variable among the included studies ranging between 21% and 100%.  Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality risk ratio of 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.608 to 0.797; I2 = 98%).  Subgroup analysis according to country of origin showed homogeneity in the 8 Chinese studies with high pooled mortality risk ratio of 0.97 (I2 = 24%, p = 0.23) (95% CI = 0.94–1.00), similar to Italy with a low pooled mortality risk ratio of 0.26 (95% CI 0.08–0.43) with homogeneity (p = 0.86) while the later larger studies coming from the USA showed pooled estimate mortality risk ratio of 0.60 (95% CI 0.43–0.76) with persistent heterogeneity (I2 = 98%, p&lt;0.001).  Meta-regression showed that outcome from IMV improved with time (p&lt;0.001).  Age had no statistically significant effect on mortality (p = 0.102).  Publication bias was excluded by visualizing the funnel plot of standard error, Egger’s test with p = 0.714 and Begg&amp;Mazumdar test with p = 0.334. Interpretation The study included the largest number of patients with outcome findings of IMV in this current pandemic.  Our findings showed that the use of IMV for selected COVID 19 patients with severe ARDS carries a high mortality, but outcome has improved over the last few months and in more recent studies.  The results should encourage physicians to use this facility when indicated for severely ill COVID-19 patients.
A meta-analysis of corticosteroids for COVID-19 treatment Objectives Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in patients with 2019-nCoV (novel coronavirus 2019) infection still are debated.  Because large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and a well-conducted meta-analysis on the use of corticosteroids, focused on patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in intensive care units, recently were published, a meta-analysis of RCTs on corticosteroids therapy in patients with different disease severity was performed to evaluate the effect on survival.   Design A meta-analyses of RCTs was performed.   Setting Patients admitted to hospital.   Participants Patients with coronavirus disease.   Interventions Administration of corticosteroids.   Measurements and Main Results A search was performed for RCTs of adult patients with acute hypoxemic failure related to 2019-nCoV infection who received corticosteroids versus any comparator.  The primary endpoint was mortality rate.  Five RCTs involving 7,692 patients were included.  Overall mortality of patients treated with corticosteroids was slightly but significantly lower than mortality of controls (26% v 28%, relative risk {RR} = 0.89 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.82-0.96], p = 0.003).  The same beneficial effect was found in the subgroup of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (RR = 0.85 [95% CI 0.72-1.00], p = 0.05 number needed to treat {NNT} = 19).  Remarkably, corticosteroids increased mortality in the subgroup of patients not requiring oxygen (17% v 13%, RR = 1.23 [95% CI 1.00-1.62], p = 0.05 number needed to harm {NNH} = 29).  Tests for comparison between mechanically ventilated subgroups and those not requiring oxygen confirmed that treatment with corticosteroids had a statistically significant different effect on survival.  Patients treated with corticosteroids had a significantly lower risk of need for mechanical ventilation.   Conclusions Corticosteroids may be considered in severe critically ill patients with COVID-19 but must be discouraged in patients not requiring oxygen therapy.  Urgently, further trials are warranted before implementing this treatment worldwide.
Mass screening versus community containment versus a combination of both to mitigate COVID-19: a rapid systematic review Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as lockdown and mass testing, remain as the mainstay of control measures for the outbreak. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of mass testing, lockdown, or a combination of both to control COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search on 11 major databases was conducted on June 8, 2020. This review is registered in Prospero (CRD420201 90546). We included primary studies written in English which investigate mass screening, lockdown, or a combination of both to control and/or mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. There are four important outcomes as selected by WHO experts for their decision- making process: incident cases, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use. Among 623 studies, only 14 studies met our criteria. Four observational studies were rated as strong evidence and ten modelling studies were rated as moderate evidence. Based on one modelling study, mass testing reduced the total infected people compared to no mass testing. For lockdown, ten studies consistently showed that it successfully reduced the incidence, onward transmission, and mortality rate of COVID-19. A limited evidence showed that a combination of lockdown and mass screening resulted in a greater reduction of incidence and mortality rate compared to lockdown only. However, there is not enough evidence on the effectiveness of mass testing only.
Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions targeted at COVID-19 pandemic on influenza incidence and deaths Objectives To better understand the impact of comprehensive COVID-19 targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on influenza burden worldwide.   Methods We conducted a systematic literature search in selected databases (PubMed, WHO COVID-19), preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv) and websites of European Public Health institutes.  Documents that compared influenza estimates in the 2019/2020 season with previous seasons were included.  Information synthesis was qualitative due to a high heterogeneity in the number and periods of comparative seasons, outcome measures and statistical methods.   Results We included 23 records reporting from 15 countries/regions as well as 8 reports from European Public Health agencies.  Estimates in the 2019/2020 season based on influenza virus tests (4 out of 7 countries/regions), defined influenza cases (8 out of 9), influenza positivity rate (7 out of 8), and severe complications (1 out of 2) were lower than in former seasons.  Results from syndromic indicators, such as influenza-like-illness (ILI), were less clear or even raised (4 out of 7) after the influenza season indicating a misclassification with COVID-19 cases.   Conclusions Evidence synthesis suggests that NPIs targeted at SARS-CoV-2-transmission reduce influenza burden as well.  Low threshold NPIs need to be more strongly emphasized in influenza prevention strategies.
Effect of COVID-19 on Tele-eyecare practice: a systematic review 
The role and response of primary care and community nursing in the delivery of palliative care in epidemics and pandemics: protocol for a rapid review to inform practice and service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic Background: The increased number of deaths in the community happening as a result of COVID-19 has caused primary healthcare services to change their traditional service delivery in a short timeframe.  Services are quickly adapting to new challenges in the practical delivery of end-of-life care to patients in the community including through virtual consultations and in the provision of timely symptom control.   Aim: To synthesise existing evidence related to the delivery of palliative and end-of-life care by primary healthcare professionals in epidemics and pandemics.   Design: Rapid systematic review using modified systematic review methods, with narrative synthesis of the evidence.   Data sources: Searches were carried out in Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science on 7th March 2020. Results: Only five studies met the inclusion criteria, highlighting a striking lack of evidence base for the response of primary healthcare services in palliative care during epidemics and pandemics.  All were observational studies.  Findings were synthesised using a pandemic response framework according to ‘systems’ (community providers feeling disadvantaged in terms of receiving timely information and protocols), ‘space’ (recognised need for more care in the community), ‘staff’ (training needs and resilience) and ‘stuff’ (other aspects of managing care in pandemics including personal protective equipment, cleaning care settings and access to investigations).   Conclusions: As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, there is an urgent need for research to provide increased understanding of the role of primary care and community nursing services in palliative care, alongside hospices and community specialist palliative care providers.
Impact of disasters, including pandemics such as COVID-19, on cardiometabolic outcomes across the life-course: a systematic review Background Disasters are events that disrupt the daily functioning of a community or society, and may increase long-term risk of adverse cardiometabolic outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes.  The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review to determine the impact of disasters, including pandemics, on cardiometabolic outcomes across the life-course.   Design A systematic search was conducted in May 2020 using two electronic databases, EMBASE and Medline.  All studies were screened in duplicate at title and abstract, and full-text level.  Studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed the association between a population-level or community disaster and cardiometabolic outcomes ?1 month following the disaster.  There were no restrictions on age, year of publication, country or population.  Data were extracted on study characteristics, exposure (eg, type of disaster, region, year), cardiometabolic outcomes and measures of effect.  Study quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools.   Results A total of 58 studies were included, with 24 studies reporting the effects of exposure to disaster during pregnancy/childhood and 34 studies reporting the effects of exposure during adulthood.  Studies included exposure to natural (n=35; 60%) and human-made (n=23; 40%) disasters, with only three (5%) of these studies evaluating previous pandemics.  Most studies reported increased cardiometabolic risk, including increased cardiovascular disease incidence or mortality, diabetes and obesity, but not all.  Few studies evaluated the biological mechanisms or high-risk subgroups that may be at a greater risk of negative health outcomes following disasters.   Conclusions The findings from this study suggest that the burden of disasters extend beyond the known direct harm, and attention is needed on the detrimental indirect long-term effects on cardiometabolic health.  Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, these findings may inform public health prevention strategies to mitigate the impact of future cardiometabolic risk.

Prevalence and impact of cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19 Background The exact prevalence and impact of cardiac injury in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still controversial. Hence, we aim to investigate prevalence of cardiac injury and its impact on the outcomes in patients with COVID-19.  Hypothesis Cardiac injury is common and associated with higher risk of death.  Methods We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, MedRxiv, and EMBASE databases from December 2019 to July 15, 2020 for studies that evaluated the prevalence and impact of cardiac injury on COVID-19. This study has been registered with PROSPERO (International prospective register of systematic reviews)-registration number-CRD-42020186120.  Results Twenty-one studies including 6297 participants were identified. The proportions of cardiac injury were 22%, 28% among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 or severe COVID-19 patients, respectively. The incidences of cardiac injury in advance age (>60 years) (30%) was about two-fold than young patients (<60 years) (15%) with COVID-19. Severe cases (42%) have seven-fold prevalence cardiac injury than in their non- severe counterparts (6%). Furthermore, cardiac injury is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 (OR 10.11, 95% CI 4.49–22.77). In patients with severe COVID-19, cardiac injury is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (OR: 16.79, 95% CI: 5.52–51.02).  Conclusions This was the first meta-analysis exploring the prevalence and impact of cardiac injury on COVID-19. Cardiac injury is common in hospitalized patients and advanced age and severe COVID-19 patients prone to experience more risk of cardiac injury. Furthermore, cardiac injury is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality.
Exploring the impact of COVID-19 on mental health outcomes in children and adolescents: a systematic review The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been widely discussed during the past few months, with scholars expressing concern about its potential debilitating consequences on youth mental health. Hence, this research aimed to provide a systematic review of the evidence on the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on youth mental health. We conducted a mixed methods integrated review to identify any empirical study that focused on young people ? 18 years old. Eight databases were systematically searched to identify studies of any type of research design. The selection procedure followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol of this systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (protocol ID: CRD4202019375). Twelve studies deemed eligible for data extraction (n = 12,262). The findings show that COVID-19 has an impact on youth mental health and is particularly associated with depression and anxiety in adolescent cohorts. The quality appraisal indicated that all studies were of low or moderate methodological quality. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting young people’s lives, and thus generating robust research evidence to inform policy decisions is essential. Hence, the methodological quality of future research should be drastically improved.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) markedly increases mortality in patients with hip fracture: a systematic review and meta-analysis Introduction This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its impact on mortality in patients with hip fracture.   Methods We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Central Database, and medRvix from inception up to July 13, 2020 on research articles that enrolled hip fracture patients who had information on COVID-19 and clinically validated definition of death.   Results A total of 984 participants from 6 studies were included in our study.  The pooled prevalence of COVID-19 was 9% [95% CI: 7–11%].  The mortality rate in patients with concomitant hip fracture and COVID-19 was found to be 36% (95% CI: 26–47%), whereas the mortality rate in hip fracture without COVID-19 is 2% (95% CI: 1–3%).  Meta-analysis showed that COVID-19 was associated with a seven-fold increase in risk (RR 7.45 [95% CI: 2.72, 20.43], p &lt; 0.001; I2: 68.6%) of mortality in patients with hip fracture.  Regression-based Harbord’s test showed no indication of small-study effects (p = 0.06).   Conclusion The present meta-analysis showed that COVID-19 increased the risk of mortality in patients with hip fracture.   Trial registration This study is registered with PROSPERO, July 21, 2020, number CRD42020199618. Available from https://www.  crd.  york.  ac.  uk/prospero/display_record.  php?ID=CRD42020199618.
The effects of ACEIs/ARBs on mortality in COVID-19 infected patients: a meta-analysis and systematic review Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are one of the most prescribed antihypertensive medications. Previous studies showed RAAS inhibitors increase the expression of ACE2, a cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which provokes a concern that the use of ACEI and ARB in hypertensive individuals might lead to increased mortality and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To further investigate the effects of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 patients, we systematically reviewed relevant studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria in search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. The search strategy included clinical data published through October 12, 2020. Twenty-six studies involving 8104 hypertensive patients in ACEI/ARB-treated group and 8203 hypertensive patients in non-ACEI/ARB-treated group were analyzed. Random-effects meta-analysis showed ACEI/ARB treatment was significantly associated with a lower risk of mortality in hypertensive COVID-19 patients (odds ratio [OR] = 0.624, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.457–0.852, p = .003, I2 = 74.3%). Meta-regression analysis showed that age, gender, study site, Newcastle–Ottawa Scale scores, comorbidities of diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, or cancer has no significant modulating effect of ACEI/ARB treatment on the mortality of hypertensive COVID-19 patients (all p > .1). In addition, the ACEI/ARB treatment was associated with a lower risk of ventilatory support (OR = 0.682, 95% CI = 0.475–1.978, p = .037, I2 = 0.0%). In conclusion, these results suggest that ACEI/ARB medications should not be discontinued for hypertensive patients in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.
Perioperative mortality and morbidity in hip fractures among COVID positive and COVID negative patients: a systematic review and meta analysis Purpose Hip fractures among elderly patients are surgical emergencies.  During COVID-19 pandemic time, many such patients could not be operated at early time because of the limitation of the medical resources, the risk of infection and redirection of medical attention to a severe infective health problem.   Methods A search of electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) with the keywords “COVID”, “COVID-19?, “SARS-COV-2”, “Corona”, “pandemic”, “hip fracture”, “trochanteric fracture” and “neck femur fracture” revealed 64 studies evaluating treatment of hip fracture in elderly patients during COVID-19 pandemic time.  The 30-day mortality rate, inpatient mortality rate, critical care/special care need, readmission rate and complications rate in both groups were evaluated.  Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan) V.  5.3. Results After screening, 7 studies were identified that described the mortality and morbidity in hip fractures in both COVID-19 infected (COVID-19 +) and non-infected (COVID-19 ?) patients.  There were significantly increased risks of 30-day mortality (32.23% COVID-19 + death vs.  8.85% COVID-19 ? death) and inpatient mortality (29.33% vs.  2.62%) among COVID-19 + patients with odds ratio (OR) of 4.84 (95% CI: 3.13 – 7.47, p &lt; 0.001) and 15.12 (95% CI: 6.12 – 37.37, p &lt; 0.001), respectively.  The COVID-19 + patients needed more critical care admission (OR = 5.08, 95% CI: 1.49 – 17.30, p &lt; 0.009) and they remain admitted for a longer time in hospital (mean difference = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.74 – 5.45, p &lt; 0.001); but there was no difference in readmission rate between these 2 groups.  The risks of overall complications (OR = 17.22), development of pneumonia (OR = 22.25), and acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute respiratory failure (OR = 32.96) were significantly high among COVID-19 + patients compared to COVID-19 ? patients.   Conclusions There are increased risks of the 30-day mortality, inpatient mortality and critical care admission among hip fracture patients who are COVID-19 +.  The chances of developing pneumonia and acute respiratory failure are more in COVID-19 + patients than in COVID-19 ? patients.
Eating behavior changes during COVID-19 pandemic: protocol for a systematic review Eating behaviour is a complex construct that is liable to be modified by external factors. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many restrictive measures were carried out with the aim of reducing the impact of this disease. As a result, lifestyles were disrupted, which could affect eating behaviours. The aim of this systematic review of longitudinal studies was to assess changes in eating behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing a comparison of eating behaviours before and after the outbreak of the pandemic. This study followed the PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO: CRD42020203246), whereas to assess the quality of the studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) was applied. Out of a set of 826 studies, 23 were included in this systematic review. The main findings provided information about a shift towards modified eating behaviours, characterized by an increased snack frequency and a preference for sweets and ultra-processed food rather than fruits, vegetables, and fresh food. Additionally, an increased alcohol consumption was found among different countries. Consequently, adherence to healthy diets decreased. These findings are relevant to future policies and strategies to assess nutrition in cases of alarming situations such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Which mode of delivery is better for preventing possible vertical transmission from a pregnant mother confirmed with COVID-19 to a neonate? Cesarean or vaginal delivery? Background: The impact of delivery mode on the infection rates of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the newborn remains unknown. We aimed to summarize the existing literature on COVID-19 infection during pregnancy to evaluate which mode of delivery is better for preventing possible vertical transmission from a pregnant mother confirmed with COVID-19 to a neonate.
Eyes are the windows to COVID-19? a systematic review and meta-analysis Objective To review and critically appraise the ocular manifestation and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 through PCR positivity from ocular samples in COVID-19-related patients.  Moreover, to evaluate the time and severity association of ocular manifestation to systemic disease of COVID-19. Methods and analysis A systematic literature search from PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar databases was performed using standardised Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline.  Selected keywords were related to COVID-19, ocular manifestation and PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2. Studies were assessed for their validity, and the data were extracted by two independent reviewers.  Observational, case series and case report studies were included if they met the selection criteria.  Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled prevalence of ocular manifestations and PCR positivity from tears.   Results Thirty-one articles were qualitatively reviewed, and 14 studies were included in the meta-analysis.  The pooled prevalence of ocular manifestation among COVID-19-related patients was 0.05 (95% CI 0.02% to 0.08).  The overall PCR from tears samples positivity rate from COVID-19-related patients presenting with ocular manifestation was 0.38 (95% CI 0.14% to 0.65).  Ocular manifestation could precede systemic manifestation in about 0.28 (95% CI 0.05% to 0.58) of COVID-19-related patients with ocular manifestations.  Besides, ocular manifestation was not associated with a severe form of COVID-19. Conclusion Although the overall number of ocular manifestation and SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rate from ocular samples was very low, around a quarter of COVID-19-related patients with ocular manifestation presented their ocular manifestation earlier than the systemic manifestation regardless of the severity.  Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive from one-third of ocular samples, which could potentially be the source of infection to the respiratory tract and the environment, although the infectivity is yet to be determined.
Refugees and migrants and COVID-19: a rapid systematic review The economic and health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic pose a particular threat to vulnerable groups, such as migrants, particularly forcibly displaced populations. The aim of this review is (i) to synthesize the evidence on risk of infection and transmission among migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced populations, and (ii) the effect of lockdown measures on these populations. We searched MEDLINE and WOS, preprint servers, and pertinent websites between 1st December 2019 and 26th June 2020. The included studies showed a high heterogeneity in study design, population, outcome and quality. The incidence risk of SARS-CoV-2 varied from 0•12% to 2•08% in non-outbreak settings and from 5•64% to 21•15% in outbreak settings. Migrants showed a lower hospitalization rate compared to non-migrants. Negative impacts on mental health due to lockdown measures were found across respective studies. However, findings show a tenuous and heterogeneous data situation, showing the need for more robust and comparative study designs.
Impact of COVID-19 on adolescent’s psychological state and mental health: a systematic review Background id="Par1">The impact of COVID-19 towards psychology and mental health is anticipated to be significant and may affect the population disproportionately, especially adolescent as the vulnerable category.  We aimed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 towards adolescents’ mental health.   Main body id="Par2">A systematic search was conducted from Cochrane, Google Scholar, Scielo, and PubMed.  Inclusion criteria included all types of studies which observed the effect of COVID-19 and its related causes, such as lockdown, on adolescents’ mental health.  All studies were assessed for its level of evidence according to Oxford 2011 criteria and Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS).  Three studies (Seçer and Ula?, Int J Ment Health Addict: 1–14, 2020; Zhou et al.  , Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry 29:749–58, 2020; Qu et al.  , Lancet: 1–17, 2020) showed that COVID-19 was a risk factor for mental health problems in adolescents while Oosterhoff et al.  (J Adolesc Health 67: 179–185, 2020) showed that adolescents who preferred to stay at home during this pandemic reported less anxiety and depressive symptoms Conclusion id="Par3">COVID-19 has been found to be associated with mental health changes in adolescents which meant management of COVID-19 should also focus on mental health as well.
Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis Introduction In addition to the directly attributed mortality, COVID-19 is also likely to increase mortality indirectly.  In this systematic review, we investigate the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.   Methods We searched PubMed, BioMedCentral, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies comparing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurring during the pandemic and a non-pandemic period.  Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool.  The primary endpoint was return of spontaneous circulation.  Secondary endpoints were bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, survival to hospital discharge, and survival with favourable neurological outcome.   Results We identified six studies.  In two studies, rates of return of spontaneous circulation and survival to hospital discharge decreased significantly during the pandemic.  Especially in Europe, bystander-witnessed cases, bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation and resuscitation attempted by emergency medical services were reduced during the pandemic.  Also, ambulance response times were significantly delayed across all studies and patients presenting with non-shockable rhythms increased in two studies.  In 2020, 3.9–5.9% of tested patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 4.8–26% had suggestive symptoms (fever and cough or dyspnoea).   Conclusions Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests had worse short-term outcomes during the pandemic than a non-pandemic period suggesting direct effects of COVID-19 infection and indirect effects from lockdown and disruption of healthcare systems.  Patients at high risk of deterioration should be identified outside the hospital to promptly initiate treatment and reduce fatalities.
Hydroxychloroquine for treatment of nonsevere COVID?19 patients: Systematic review and meta?analysis of controlled clinical trials Being a pandemic and having a high global case fatality rate directed us to assess the evidence strength of hydroxychloroquine efficacy in treating coronavirus disease?2019 (COVID?19) arising from clinical trials and to update the practice with the most reliable clinical evidence.
A systematic review of human microbiome alternation in COVID-19 cases Background Human microbiotas are communities of microorganisms living in symbiosis with humans.  They play an important role in the host immune response to respiratory viral infection.  However, evidence on the human microbiome and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) relationship is insufficient.  The aim of this systematic literature review was to evaluate existing evidence on the association between the microbiome and COVID-19 in humans and summarize these data in the pandemic era.   Methods We conducted a systematic literature review on the association between the microbiome and COVID-19 in humans by searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases for articles in English published up to October 31, 2020. The results were analyzed qualitatively.  This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020195982).   Results Of the 543 articles identified by searching databases, 16 in line with the research objectives were eligible for qualitative review: eight sampled the microbiome using stool, four using nasopharyngeal or throat swab, three using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and one using lung tissue.  Fecal microbiome dysbiosis and increased opportunistic pathogens were reported in COVID-19 patients.  Several studies suggested the dysbiosis in the lung microbiome of COVID-19 patients with an abundance of opportunistic pathogens using lower respiratory tract samples.  The association between COVID-19 severity and the human microbiome remains uncertain.   Conclusion The human fecal and respiratory tract microbiome changed in COVID-19 patients with opportunistic pathogen abundance.  Further research to elucidate the effect of alternation of the human microbiome in disease pathogenesis is warranted.
Effective public health measures to mitigate the spread of COVID 19: a systematic review Background id="Par1">In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was recognized in Wuhan, China.  It was characterised by rapid spread causing a pandemic.  Multiple public health interventions have been implemented worldwide to decrease the transmission of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).  The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the implemented public health interventions to control the spread of the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Science Direct and MedRxiv for relevant articles published in English up to March 16, 2021. We included quasi experimental studies, clinical trials, cohort studies, longitudinal studies, case-control studies and interrupted time series.  We included the studies that investigated the effect of the implemented public health measures to prevent and control the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).   Results id="Par2">The database search using the predefined combinations of Mesh terms found 13,497 studies of which 3595 in PubMed, 7393 in Science Direct 2509 preprints in MedRxiv.  After removal of the duplicates and the critical reading only 18 articles were included in this systematic review and processed for data extraction.   Conclusions id="Par3">Public health interventions and non-pharmaceutical measurements were effective in decreasing the transmission of COVID-19. The included studies showed that travel restrictions, borders measures, quarantine of travellers arriving from affected countries, city lockdown, restrictions of mass gathering, isolation and quarantine of confirmed cases and close contacts, social distancing measures, compulsory mask wearing, contact tracing and testing, school closures and personal protective equipment use among health workers were effective in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.
A systematic review on the effect of weather on COVID-19 mortality Weather conditions may have an impact on SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission, as has been shown for seasonal influenza. Virus transmission most likely favors low temperature and low humidity conditions. This systematic review aimed to collect evidence on the impact of temperature and humidity on COVID-19 mortality. This review was registered with PROSPERO (registration no. CRD42020196055). We searched the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane COVID-19 databases for observational epidemiological studies. Two independent reviewers screened the title/abstracts and full texts of the studies. Two reviewers also performed data extraction and quality assessment. From 5051 identified studies, 11 were included in the review. Although the results were inconsistent, most studies imply that a decrease in temperature and humidity contributes to an increase in mortality. To establish the association with greater certainty, future studies should consider accurate exposure measurements and important covariates, such as government lockdowns and population density, sufficient lag times, and non-linear associations.
Antibiotic prescribing in patients with COVID-19: a rapid review and meta-analysis Background The proportion of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 that are prescribed antibiotics is uncertain, and may contribute to patient harm and global antibiotic resistance.   Objective The aim was to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of antibiotic prescribing in patients with COVID-19. Data Sources We searched MEDLINE, OVID Epub and EMBASE for published literature on human subjects in English up to June 9 2020. Study Eligibility Criteria We included randomized controlled trials; cohort studies; case series with ?10 patients; and experimental or observational design that evaluated antibiotic prescribing.   Participants The study participants were patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, across all healthcare settings (hospital and community) and age groups (paediatric and adult).   Methods The main outcome of interest was proportion of COVID-19 patients prescribed an antibiotic, stratified by geographical region, severity of illness and age.  We pooled proportion data using random effects meta-analysis.   Results We screened 7469 studies, from which 154 were included in the final analysis.  Antibiotic data were available from 30 623 patients.  The prevalence of antibiotic prescribing was 74.6% (95% CI 68.3–80.0%).  On univariable meta-regression, antibiotic prescribing was lower in children (prescribing prevalence odds ratio (OR) 0.10, 95% CI 0.03–0.33) compared with adults.  Antibiotic prescribing was higher with increasing patient age (OR 1.45 per 10 year increase, 95% CI 1.18–1.77) and higher with increasing proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (OR 1.33 per 10% increase, 95% CI 1.15–1.54).  Estimated bacterial co-infection was 8.6% (95% CI 4.7–15.2%) from 31 studies.   Conclusions Three-quarters of patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotics, prescribing is significantly higher than the estimated prevalence of bacterial co-infection.  Unnecessary antibiotic use is likely to be high in patients with COVID-19.
Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for COVID-19 patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background id="Par1">There are several reports of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to guide clinical decision-making and future research.   Methods id="Par2">We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and Scopus databases from 1 December 2019 to 10 January 2021 for observational studies or randomised clinical trials examining ECMO in adults with COVID-19 ARDS.  We performed random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression, assessed risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist and rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.  Survival outcomes were presented as pooled proportions while continuous outcomes were presented as pooled means, both with corresponding 95% confidence intervals [CIs].  The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.  Secondary outcomes were duration of ECMO therapy and mechanical ventilation, weaning rate from ECMO and complications during ECMO.    Results id="Par3">We included twenty-two observational studies with 1896 patients in the meta-analysis.  Venovenous ECMO was the predominant mode used (98.6%).  The pooled in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients (22 studies, 1896 patients) supported with ECMO was 37.1% (95% CI 32.3–42.0%, high certainty).  Pooled mortality in the venovenous ECMO group was 35.7% (95% CI 30.7–40.7%, high certainty).  Meta-regression found that age and ECMO duration were associated with increased mortality.  Duration of ECMO support (18 studies, 1844 patients) was 15.1 days (95% CI 13.4–18.7).  Weaning from ECMO (17 studies, 1412 patients) was accomplished in 67.6% (95% CI 50.5–82.7%) of patients.  There were a total of 1583 ECMO complications reported (18 studies, 1721 patients) and renal complications were the most common.   Conclusion id="Par4">The majority of patients received venovenous ECMO support for COVID-19-related ARDS.  In-hospital mortality in patients receiving ECMO support for COVID-19 was 37.1% during the first year of the pandemic, similar to those with non-COVID-19-related ARDS.  Increasing age was a risk factor for death.  Venovenous ECMO appears to be an effective intervention in selected patients with COVID-19-related ARDS.

Physical activity and sedentary behaviours of people during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown compared with before the lockdown Objective In March 2020, several countries banned unnecessary outdoor activities during COVID-19, commonly called ‘lockdowns.  These lockdowns have the potential to impact associated levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviour.  Given the numerous health outcomes associated with physical activity and sedentary behaviour, the aim of this review was to summarise literature that investigated differences in physical activity and sedentary behaviour before vs during the COVID-19 lockdown.   Design, data sources and eligibility criteria Electronic databases were searched from November 2019 to October 2020 using terms and synonyms relating to physical activity, sedentary behaviour and COVID-19. The coprimary outcomes were changes in physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour captured via device-based measures or self-report tools.  Risk of bias was measured using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.   Results Sixty six articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review (total n=86 981).  Changes in physical activity were reported in 64 studies, with the majority of studies reporting decreases in physical activity and increases in sedentary behaviours during their respective lockdowns across several populations, including children and patients with a variety of medical conditions.   Conclusion Given the numerous physical and mental benefits of increased physical activity and decreased sedentary behaviour, public health strategies should include the creation and implementation of interventions that promote safe physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour should other lockdowns occur.
Impacts of COVID-19 on people with physical disabilities: a rapid review Background The COVID-19 pandemic caused drastic changes in the lives of the general population.  People with physical disabilities, who commonly encounter daily challenges such as barriers to community mobility, reduced access to healthcare services and higher risk of suffering from depression, may face additional challenges in the context of the pandemic.   Objective This study aims to review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, among people with physical disabilities.   Methods A rapid review of the published literature was conducted on August 10, 2020 through a search in six online databases to synthesize results from original studies regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with physical disabilities.  The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health was used to describe the population and the personal and environmental factors with a unified and standard health language.   Results Eleven records were extracted from 1621 individual papers retrieved from the search strategy.  Various impacts on daily functioning such as a decrease in access to healthcare have been noted during the pandemic.  Changes in social and lifestyle habits, mood changes and decreased levels of physical activity were also noted.   Conclusions Our results highlighted the lack of early research about the impacts of COVID-19 experienced by people with physical disabilities.  Future studies should focus on specific consequences and needs of this vulnerable population to ensure their inclusion in public health recommendations and consideration by policy makers.
CT features of Coronavirus disease 2019 in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background: There are few reports on the chest computed tomography (CT) imaging features of children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and most reports involve small sample sizes.   Objectives: To systematically analyze the chest CT imaging features of children with COVID-19 and provide references for clinical practice.   Data sources: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase; data published by Johns Hopkins University; and Chinese databases CNKI, Wanfang, and Chongqing Weipu.   Methods: Reports on chest CT imaging features of children with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 to August 10, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively and a meta-analysis carried out using Stata12.0 software.   Results: Thirty-seven articles (1747 children) were included in this study.  The heterogeneity of meta-analysis results ranged from 0% to 90.5%.  The overall rate of abnormal lung CT findings was 63.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55.8%–70.6%), with a rate of 61.0% (95% CI: 50.8%–71.2%) in China and 67.8% (95% CI: 57.1%–78.4%) in the rest of the world in the subgroup analysis.  The incidence of ground-glass opacities was 39.5% (95% CI: 30.7%–48.3%), multiple lung lobe lesions was 65.1% (95% CI: 55.1%–67.9%), and bilateral lung lesions was 61.5% (95% CI: 58.8%–72.2%).  Other imaging features included nodules (25.7%), patchy shadows (36.8%), halo sign (24.8%), consolidation (24.1%), air bronchogram signs (11.2%), cord-like shadows (9.7%), crazy-paving pattern (6.1%), and pleural effusion (9.1%).  Two articles reported 3 cases of white lung, another reported 2 cases of pneumothorax, and another 1 case of bullae.   Conclusions: The lung CT results of children with COVID-19 are usually normal or slightly atypical.  The lung lesions of COVID-19 pediatric patients mostly involve both lungs or multiple lobes, and the common manifestations are patchy shadows, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, partial air bronchogram signs, nodules, and halo signs; white lung, pleural effusion, and paving stone signs are rare.  Therefore, chest CT has limited value as a screening tool for children with COVID-19 and can only be used as an auxiliary assessment tool.
Pulmonary embolism and venous thromboembolism in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis Background The association of pulmonary embolism (PE) with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear, and the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE is unknown.   Purpose To conduct meta-analysis of the study-level incidence of PE and DVT and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE from multicenter individual patient data.   Materials and Methods A systematic literature search identified studies evaluating the incidence of PE or DVT in patients with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to June 15, 2020. These outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model and were further evaluated using metaregression analysis.  The diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE was estimated on the basis of individual patient data using the summary receiver operating characteristic curve.   Results Twenty-seven studies with 3342 patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis.  The pooled incidence rates of PE and DVT were 16.5% (95% CI: 11.6, 22.9; I2 = 0.93) and 14.8% (95% CI: 8.5, 24.5; I2 = 0.94), respectively.  PE was more frequently found in patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (24.7% [95% CI: 18.6, 32.1] vs 10.5% [95% CI: 5.1, 20.2] in those not admitted to the ICU) and in studies with universal screening using CT pulmonary angiography.  DVT was present in 42.4% of patients with PE.  D-dimer tests had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.737 for PE, and D-dimer levels of 500 and 1000 ?g/L showed high sensitivity (96% and 91%, respectively) but low specificity (10% and 24%, respectively).   Conclusion Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurred in 16.5% and 14.8% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively, and more than half of patients with PE lacked DVT.  The cutoffs of D-dimer levels used to exclude PE in preexisting guidelines seem applicable to patients with COVID-19.
A rapid diagnostic test accuracy review of fear of COVID-19 scales Background id="Par1">The COVID-19 pandemic has become a source of fear across the world.  Measuring the level or significance of fear in different populations may help identify populations and areas in need of public health and education campaigns.  We were interested in diagnostic tests developed to assess or diagnose COVID-19-related fear or phobia.   Methods id="Par2">We performed a systematic review of studies that examined instruments diagnosing or assessing fear or phobia of COVID-19 (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020197100).  We utilized the Norwegian Institute of Public Health’s Live map of covid-19 evidence, a database of pre-screened and pre-categorized studies.  The Live map of covid-19 evidence identified references published since 1 December 2019 in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Following biweekly searches, two researchers independently categorized all studies according to topic (seven main topics, 52 subordinate topics), population (41 available groups), study design, and publication type.  For this review, we assessed for eligibility all studies that had been categorized to the topic “Experiences and perceptions, consequences; social, political, economic aspects” as of 25 September 2020, in addition to hand-searching included studies’ reference lists.  We meta-analyzed correlation coefficients of fear scores to the most common reference tests (self-reports of anxiety, depression, and stress), and reported additional concurrent validity to other reference tests such as specific phobias.  We assessed study quality using the QUADAS-2 for the minority of studies that presented diagnostic accuracy statistics.   Results id="Par3">We found 18 studies that validated fear instruments.  Fifteen validated the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S).  We found no studies that proposed a diagnosis of fear of COVID-19 or a threshold of significant/clinical versus non-significant/subclinical fear.  Study quality was low, with the most common potential biases related to sampling strategy and un-blinded data analysis.  The FSV-19S total score correlated strongly with severe phobia (r = 0.703, 95%CI 0.634–0.761) in one study, and moderately with anxiety in a meta-analysis.   Conclusions id="Par4">The accuracy of the FSV-19S needs to be measured further using fear-related reference instruments, and future studies need to provide cut-off scores and normative values.  Further evaluation of the remaining three instruments is required.   Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12874-021-01262-5.
