Metformin, the most commonly prescribed glucose-lowering agent, has been proposed to influence susceptibility to and outcomes of COVID-19 via multiple mechanisms.\n\n We investigated whether, in patients with diabetes, metformin is associated with susceptibility to COVID-19 and its outcomes.\n\n\nResearch Design and Methods\nWe performed a propensity score–matched cohort study with active comparators using a large UK primary care dataset.\n\n Adults with type 2 diabetes patients and a current prescription for metformin and other glucose-lowering agents (MF+) were compared to those with a current prescription for glucose-lowering agents that did not include metformin (MF?).\n\n Outcomes were confirmed COVID-19, suspected/confirmed COVID-19, and associated mortality.\n\n A negative control outcome analysis (back pain) was also performed.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 29 558 and 10 271 patients in the MF+ and MF? groups, respectively, who met the inclusion criteria.\n\n In the propensity score–matched analysis, the adjusted hazard ratios for suspected/confirmed COVID-19, confirmed COVID-19, and COVID-19-related mortality were 0.85 (95% CI 0.67, 1.08), 0.80 (95% CI 0.49, 1.30), and 0.87 (95% CI 0.34, 2.20) respectively.\n\n The negative outcome control analysis did not suggest unobserved confounding.\n\n\nConclusion\nCurrent prescription of metformin was not associated with the risk of COVID-19 or COVID-19-related mortality.\n\n It is safe to continue prescribing metformin to improve glycemic control in patients

We used multivariable logistic regression models with multiple imputation to identify risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within this surveillance network.\n\n\nFindings\nWe identified 3802 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 587 were positive.\n\n In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (296 [18·4%] of 1612 men vs 291 [13·3%] of 2190 women; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·55, 95% CI 1·27–1·89).\n\n Adults were at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with children, and people aged 40–64 years were at greatest risk in the multivariable model (243 [18·5%] of 1316 adults aged 40–64 years vs 23 [4·6%] of 499 children; adjusted OR 5·36, 95% CI 3·28–8·76).\n\n Compared with white people, the adjusted odds of a positive test were greater in black people (388 [15·5%] of 2497 white people vs 36 [62·1%] of 58 black people; adjusted OR 4·75, 95% CI 2·65–8·51).\n\n People living in urban areas versus rural areas (476 [26·2%] of 1816 in urban areas vs 111 [5·6%] of 1986 in rural areas; adjusted OR 4·59, 95% CI 3·57–5·90) and in more deprived areas (197 [29·5%] of 668 in most deprived vs 143 [7·7%] of 1855 in least deprived; adjusted OR 2·03, 95% CI 1·51–2·71) were more likely to test positive.\n\n People with chronic kidney disease were more likely to test positive in the adjusted analysis (68 [32·9%] of 207 with chronic kidney disease vs 519 [14·4%] of 3595 without; adjusted OR 1·91, 95% CI 1·31–2·78), but there was no significant association with other chronic conditions in that analysis.\n\n We found increased odds of a positive test among people who are obese (142 [20·9%] of 680 people with obesity vs 171 [13·2%] of 1296 normal-weight people; adjusted OR 1·41, 95% CI 1·04–1·91).\n\n Notably, active smoking was linked with decreased odds of a positive test result (47 [11·4%] of 413 active smokers vs 201 [17·9%] of 1125 non-smokers; adjusted OR 0·49, 95% CI 0·34–0·71).\n\n\nInterpretation\nA positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in this primary care cohort was associated with similar risk factors as observed for severe outcomes of COVID-19 in hospital settings, except for smoking.\n\n We provide evidence of potential sociodemographic factors associated with a positive test, including deprivation, population density, ethnicity, and chronic kidney disease.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7228715","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"de

syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI).\n\n Previous studies have postulated a causal relation between obesity and ARDS/ALI but have lacked power to form a definitive conclusion.\n\n\nObjective\nTo investigate the relationships between obesity, ARDS/ALIrisk, and mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic search current to April 2016 was performed in Pubmed, EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane databases to find relevant studies.\n\n All studies that estimate the effect of obesity in the morbidity and mortality of ARDS/ALI were included.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 24 studies including 9,187,248 subjects were analyzed.\n\n The combined results from 16 studies that examined the effect of obesity in morbidity of ARDS/ALI showed an89% increase in odds ratio(pooled odds ratios (OR) 1.89, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.45 to 2.47).\n\n In subgroup analysis, compared to normal weight, obesity was associated with an increased risk of ARDS/ALI (OR1.57, 95% CI 1.30–1.90 for obese (BMI30-39.9kg/m2); OR1.75, 95% CI 1.42–2.15 for obese(BMI?30kg/m2); OR1.67, 95% CI 1.04–2.68 for morbid obese(BMI?40kg/m2)).\n\n The combined results from 9 studies that examined the effect of obesity in mortality of ARDS/ALI had a pooled odds ratio(pooled OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.98).\n\n Inversely, obesity was significantly associated with reduced risk of ARDS/ALI mortality(OR0.88, 95% CI 0.78–1.00 for overweight(BMI?18.5m2); OR0.74, 95% CI 0.64–0.84 for obese (BMI30-39.9kg/m2);OR0.84, 95% CI 0.75–0.94 for 60days mortality; OR0.38, 95% CI 0.22–0.66 for 90days mortality).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data identify obesity as an important risk factor for the development of ARDS/ALI; however, ARDS/ALI outcomes are improved in this population when compared to individuals with a normal body mass index.\n\n This meta-analysis results supported ‘‘obesity paradox” in

Is a Potential Biomarker for Severe Pandemic H1N1 Influenza A Infection","abstract":"Pandemic H1N1 influenza A (H1N1pdm) is currently a dominant circulating influenza strain worldwide.\n Severe cases of H1N1pdm infection are characterized by prolonged activation of the immune response, yet the specific role of inflammatory mediators in disease is poorly understood.\n The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been implicated in both seasonal and severe pandemic H1N1 influenza A (H1N1pdm) infection.\n Here, we investigated the role of IL-6 in severe H1N1pdm infection.\n We found IL-6 to be an important feature of the host response in both humans and mice infected with H1N1pdm.\n Elevated levels of IL-6 were associated with severe disease in patients hospitalized with H1N1pdm infection.\n Notably, serum IL-6 levels associated strongly with the requirement of critical care admission and were predictive of fatal outcome.\n In C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, and B6129SF2/J mice, infection with A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1pdm) consistently triggered severe disease and increased IL-6 levels in both lung and serum.\n Furthermore, in our lethal C57BL/6J mouse model of H1N1pdm infection, global gene expression analysis indicated a pronounced IL-6 associated inflammatory response.\n Subsequently, we examined disease and outcome in IL-6 deficient mice infected with H1N1pdm.\n No significant differences in survival, weight loss, viral load, or pathology were observed between IL-6 deficient and wild-type mice following infection.\n Taken together, our findings suggest IL-6 may be a potential disease severity biomarker, but may not be a suitable therapeutic target in cases of severe H1N1pdm infection due to our mouse

A narrative review for emergency providers","abstract":"Introduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly challenging due to a lack of established therapies and treatment guidelines.\n\n With the rapid transmission of disease, even the off-label use of available therapies has been impeded by limited availability.\n\n Several antivirals, antimalarials, and biologics are being considered for treatment at this time.\n\n The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for COVID-19 and serve as a resource for health care professionals.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis narrative review was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of current therapy options for COVID-19 and address the controversial use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).\n\n PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a combination of the keywords “COVID 19,” “SARS-CoV-2,” and “treatment.\n\n” All types of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and clinical guidelines.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThere are currently no therapeutic drugs available that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2; however, several antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir) and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) have emerged as potential therapies.\n\n Current guidelines recommend combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin or chloroquine, if hydroxychloroquine is unavailable, in patients with moderate disease, although these recommendations are based on limited evidence.\n\n Remdesivir and convalescent plasma may be considered in critical patients with respiratory failure; however, access to these therapies may be limited.\n\n Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonists may be used in patients who develop evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS).\n\n Corticosteroids should be avoided unless there is evidence of refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another compelling indication for their use.\n\n ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever.\n\n\nConclusion\nThere are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development.\n\n Until the results of these trials become available, we must use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around the world to combat this pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158837","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nikita","surname":"Mehta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maryann","surname":"Mazer-Amirshahi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nour","surname":"Alkindi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ali","surname":"Pourmand","email":"pourmand@gwu.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cytokine release syndrome in severe COVID-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effective treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with tocilizumab","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effect of dexamethasone in hospitalized patients with Covid-19: preliminary report","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmj.m2648","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Dexamethasone in the management of covid-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Obesity is associated with impaired immune response to influenza vaccination in humans","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Increased risk of influenza among vaccinated adults who are obese","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Obesity outweighs protection conferred by adjuvanted influenza vaccination","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Reduced tetanus antibody titers in overweight children","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The weight of obesity on the human immune response to vaccination","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Longitudinal evaluation and decline of antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Duration of antibody responses after severe acute respiratory syndrome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Targets of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in humans with COVID-19 disease and unexposed individuals","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Presence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in COVID-19 patients and healthy donors","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41586-020-2550-z","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/sciimmunol.abd6160","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS-CoV-2 T cell immunity: specificity, function, durability, and role in protection","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"2020 Global nutrition report: action on equity to end malnutrition","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19-related school closings and risk of weight gain among children","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/s12967-020-02399-5","date":"2020-06-02","title":"Eating habits and lifestyle changes during COVID-19 lockdown: an Italian survey","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>On December 12th 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) emerged in Wuhan, China, sparking a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans (COVID-19).\n\n On the 24th of April 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the world, according to the COVID-Case Tracker by Johns Hopkins University, was 195,313, and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases was 2,783,512. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive impact on human health, causing sudden lifestyle changes, through social distancing and isolation at home, with social and economic consequences.\n\n Optimizing public health during this pandemic requires not only knowledge from the medical and biological sciences, but also of all human sciences related to lifestyle, social and behavioural studies, including dietary habits and lifestyle.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits and lifestyle changes among the Italian population aged???12 years.\n\n The study comprised a structured questionnaire packet that inquired demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, current employment); anthropometric data (reported weight and height); dietary habits information (adherence to the Mediterranean diet, daily intake of certain foods, food frequency, and number of meals/day); lifestyle habits information (grocery shopping, habit of smoking, sleep quality and physical activity).\n\n The survey was conducted from the 5th to the 24th of April 2020.\nResults\nid='Par3'>A total of 3533 respondents have been included in the study, aged between 12 and 86 years (76.1% females).\n\n The perception of weight gain was observed in 48.6% of the population; 3.3% of smokers decided to quit smoking; a slight increased physical activity has been reported, especially for bodyweight training, in 38.3% of respondents; the population group aged 18–30 years resulted in having a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet when compared to the younger and the elderly population (p?&lt;?0.001; p?&lt;?0.001, respectively); 15% of respondents turned to farmers or organic, purchasing fruits and vegetables, especially in the North and Center of Italy, where BMI values were lower.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>In this study, we have provided for the first time data on the Italian population lifestyle, eating habits and adherence to the Mediterranean Diet pattern during the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\n However, as the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, our data need to be confirmed and investigated

weight gain and neonatal outcomes in a sample of US pregnant women","abstract":"Background\nAn increasingly large share of diet comes from ultra-processed foods (UPFs), which are assemblages of food substances designed to create durable, convenient and palatable ready-to-eat products.\n\n There is increasing evidence that high UPF consumption is indicative of poor diet and is associated with obesity and metabolic disorders.\n\n This study sought to examine the relationship between percent of energy intake from ultra-processed foods (PEI-UPF) during pregnancy and maternal gestational weight gain, maternal lipids and glycemia, and neonatal body composition.\n\n We also compared the PEI-UPF indicator against the US government’s Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010).\n\n\nMethods\nData were used from a longitudinal study performed in 2013–2014 at the Women’s Health Center and Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Clinic in St.\n\n Louis, MO, USA.\n\n Subjects were pregnant women in the normal and obese weight ranges, as well as their newborns (n = 45).\n\n PEI-UPF and the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) were calculated for each subject from a one-month food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).\n\n Multiple regression (ANCOVA-like) analysis was used to analyze the relationship between PEI-UPF or HEI-2010 and various clinical outcomes.\n\n The ability of these dietary indices to predict clinical outcomes was also compared with the predictive abilities of total energy intake and total fat intake.\n\n\nResults\nAn average of 54.4 ± 13.2% of energy intake was derived from UPFs.\n\n A 1%-point increase in PEI-UPF was associated with a 1.33 kg increase in gestational weight gain (p = 0.016).\n\n Similarly, a 1%-point increase in PEI-UPF was associated with a 0.22 mm increase in thigh skinfold (p = 0.045), 0.14 mm in subscapular skinfold (p = 0.026), and 0.62 percentage points of total body adiposity (p = 0.037) in the neonate.\n\n\nDiscussion\nPEI-UPF (percent of energy intake from ultra-processed foods) was associated with and may be a useful predictor of increased gestational weight gain and neonatal body fat.\n\n PEI-UPF was a better predictor of all tested outcomes than either total energy or fat intake, and a better predictor of the three infant body fat measures than HEI-2010. UPF consumption should be limited during pregnancy and diet quality should be maximized in order to improve maternal and neonatal health.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5723430","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Karthik W.","surname":"Rohatgi","email":"karthik.rohatgi@wustl.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rachel A.","surname":"Tinius","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"W.

Beverage purchases were linked to nutritional information at the product level, reviewed by a team of nutritionists, and categorized as “high-in” or “not high-in” according to whether they contained high levels of nutrients of concern (i.\n\ne.\n\n, sugars, sodium, saturated fat, or energy) according to Chilean nutrient thresholds and were thus subject to the law’s warning label, marketing restriction, and school sales ban policies.\n\n The majority of high-in beverages were categorized as such because of high sugar content.\n\n We used fixed-effects models to compare the observed volume as well as calorie and sugar content of postregulation beverage purchases to a counterfactual based on preregulation trends, overall and by household-head educational attainment.\n\n Of households included in the study, 37% of household heads had low education (less than high school), 40% had medium education (graduated high school), and 23% had high education (graduated college), with the sample becoming more educated over the study period.\n\n Compared to the counterfactual, the volume of high-in beverage purchases decreased 22.8 mL/capita/day, postregulation (95% confidence interval [CI] ?22.9 to ?22.7; p &lt; 0.001), or 23.7% (95% CI ?23.8% to ?23.7%).\n\n High-educated and low-educated households showed similar absolute reductions in high-in beverage purchases (approximately 27 mL/capita/day; p &lt; 0.001), but for high-educated households this amounted to a larger relative decline (?28.7%, 95% CI ?28.8% to ?28.6%) compared to low-educated households (?21.5%, 95% CI ?21.6% to ?21.4%), likely because of the high-educated households’ lower level of high-in beverage purchases in the preregulation period.\n\n Calories from high-in beverage purchases decreased 11.9 kcal/capita/day (95% CI ?12.0 to ?11.9; p &lt; 0.001) or 27.5% (95% CI ?27.6% to ?27.5%).\n\n Calories purchased from beverages classified as “not high-in” increased 5.7 kcal/capita/day (95% CI 5.7–5.7; p &lt; 0.001), or 10.8% (10.8%–10.8%).\n\n Calories from total beverage purchases decreased 7.4 kcal/capita/day (95% CI ?7.4 to ?7.3; p &lt; 0.001), or 7.5% (95% CI ?7.6% to ?7.5%).\n\n A key limitation of this study is the inability to assess causality because of its observational nature.\n\n We also cannot determine whether observed changes in purchases are due to reformulation or consumer behavioral change, nor can we parse out the effects of the labeling, marketing, and school sales ban policies.\n\n\nConclusions\nPurchases of high-in beverages significantly declined following implementation of Chile’s Law of Food Labeling and Advertising; these reductions were larger than those observed from single, standalone policies, including sugar-sweetened-beverage taxes previously implemented in Latin America.\n\n Future research should evaluate the effects of Chile’s policies on purchases of high-in foods, dietary intake, and long-term purchasing changes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7012389","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lindsey Smith","surname":"Taillie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marcela","surname":"Reyes","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Marcela","surname":"Reyes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"M.

risk factors, including hyperglycaemia and obesity, and COVID-19-related mortality among people with diabetes is unclear.\n\n We assessed associations between risk factors and COVID-19-related mortality in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a population-based cohort study of people with diagnosed diabetes who were registered with a general practice in England.\n\n National population data on people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes collated by the National Diabetes Audit were linked to mortality records collated by the Office for National Statistics from Jan 2, 2017, to May 11, 2020. We identified the weekly number of deaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the first 19 weeks of 2020 and calculated the percentage change from the mean number of deaths for the corresponding weeks in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The associations between risk factors (including sex, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, HbA1c, renal impairment [from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)], BMI, tobacco smoking status, and cardiovascular comorbidities) and COVID-19-related mortality (defined as International Classification of Diseases, version 10, code U07.1 or U07.2 as a primary or secondary cause of death) between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, were investigated by use of Cox proportional hazards models.\n\n\nFindings\nWeekly death registrations in the first 19 weeks of 2020 exceeded the corresponding 3-year weekly averages for 2017–19 by 672 (50·9%) in people with type 1 diabetes and 16?071 (64·3%) in people with type 2 diabetes.\n\n Between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, among 264?390 people with type 1 diabetes and 2?874?020 people with type 2 diabetes, 1604 people with type 1 diabetes and 36?291 people with type 2 diabetes died from all causes.\n\n Of these total deaths, 464 in people with type 1 diabetes and 10?525 in people with type 2 diabetes were defined as COVID-19 related, of which 289 (62·3%) and 5833 (55·4%), respectively, occurred in people with a history of cardiovascular disease or with renal impairment (eGFR &lt;60 mL/min per 1·73 m2).\n\n Male sex, older age, renal impairment, non-white ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and previous stroke and heart failure were associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\n Compared with people with an HbA1c of 48–53 mmol/mol (6·5–7·0%), people with an HbA1c of 86 mmol/mol (10·0%) or higher had increased COVID-19-related mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2·23 [95% CI 1·50–3·30, p&lt;0·0001] in type 1 diabetes and 1·61 [1·47–1·77, p&lt;0·0001] in type 2 diabetes).\n\n In addition, in people with type 2 diabetes, COVID-19-related mortality was significantly higher in those with an HbA1c of 59 mmol/mol (7·6%) or higher than in those with an HbA1c of 48–53 mmol/mol (HR 1·22 [95% CI 1·15–1·30, p&lt;0·0001] for 59–74 mmol/mol [7·6–8·9%] and 1·36 [1·24–1·50, p&lt;0·0001] for 75–85 mmol/mol [9·0–9·9%]).\n\n The association between BMI and COVID-19-related mortality was U-shaped: in type 1 diabetes, compared with a BMI of 25·0–29·9 kg/m2, a BMI of less than 20·0 kg/m2 had an HR of 2·45 (95% CI 1·60–3·75, p&lt;0·0001) and a BMI of 40·0 kg/m2 or higher had an HR of 2·33 (1·53–3·56, p&lt;0·0001); the corresponding HRs for type 2 diabetes were 2·33 (2·11–2·56, p&lt;0·0001) and 1·60 (1·47–1·75, p&lt;0·0001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nDeaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes rose sharply during the initial COVID-19 pandemic in England.\n\n Increased COVID-19-related mortality was associated not only with cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes but, independently, also with glycaemic control and BMI.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7426091","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Naomi","surname":"Holman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Knighton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Partha","surname":"Kar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jackie","surname":"O'Keefe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matt","surname":"Curley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andy","surname":"Weaver","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emma","surname":"Barron","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chirag","surname":"Bakhai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kamlesh","surname":"Khunti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas J","surname":"Wareham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Naveed","surname":"Sattar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bob","surname":"Young","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan","surname":"Valabhji","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Bridges to Health Segmentation Model: person-level clinical segmentation data model","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"English indices of deprivation 2019","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"NOMIS official labour market statistics.

hyperglycaemia is associated with increased glucose in airway surface liquid and risk of Staphylococcus aureus infection.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo investigate whether elevation of basolateral/blood glucose concentration promotes airway Staphylococcus aureus growth and whether pretreatment with the antidiabetic drug metformin affects this relationship.\n\n\nMethods\nHuman airway epithelial cells grown at air–liquid interface (±18?h pre-treatment, 30??M–1?mM metformin) were inoculated with 5×105 colony-forming units (CFU)/cm2\nS aureus 8325-4 or JE2 or Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 on the apical surface

basolateral glucose concentration in an in vitro airway epithelia–bacteria co-culture model.\n\n S aureus reduced transepithelial electrical resistance (RT) and increased paracellular glucose flux.\n\n Metformin inhibited the glucose-induced growth of S aureus, increased RT and decreased glucose flux.\n\n Diabetic (db/db) mice infected with S aureus exhibited a higher bacterial load in their airways than control mice after 2?days and metformin treatment reversed this effect.\n\n Metformin did not decrease blood glucose but reduced paracellular flux across ex vivo murine

pathogenesis, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-? plays a key regulatory role in myofibroblast differentiation.\n\n Reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been proposed to be involved in the mechanism for TGF-?-induced myofibroblast differentiation.\n\n Metformin is a biguanide antidiabetic medication and its pharmacological action is mediated through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which regulates not only energy homeostasis but also stress responses, including ROS.\n\n Therefore, we sought to investigate the inhibitory role of metformin in lung fibrosis development via modulating TGF-? signaling.\n\n\nMethods\nTGF-?-induced myofibroblast differentiation in lung fibroblasts (LF) was used for in vitro models.\n\n The anti-fibrotic role of metfromin was examined in a bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis model.\n\n\nResults\nWe found that TGF-?-induced myofibroblast differentiation was clearly inhibited by metformin treatment in LF.\n\n Metformin-mediated activation of AMPK was responsible for inhibiting TGF-?-induced NOX4 expression.\n\n NOX4 knockdown and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment illustrated that NOX4-derived ROS generation was critical for TGF-?-induced SMAD phosphorylation and myofibroblast differentiation.\n\n BLM treatment induced development of lung fibrosis with concomitantly enhanced NOX4 expression and SMAD phosphorylation, which was efficiently inhibited by metformin.\n\n Increased NOX4 expression levels were also observed in FF of IPF lungs and LF isolated from IPF patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings suggest that metformin can be a promising anti-fibrotic modality of treatment for IPF affected by

Through individual-level linkage of population-based medical databases, type 2 diabetes was identified using a previously validated algorithm including hospital diagnoses, filled prescriptions for anti-diabetic drugs, and elevated HbA1c levels.\n\n Metformin use was identified by filled prescriptions within 90 days before admission.\n\n Covariates included surgery, preadmission morbidity, diabetes duration, and concurrent drug use.\n\n We computed 30-day mortality and hazard ratios (HRs) of death using Cox regression adjusted for covariates, both overall and after propensity score

diabetes (T2D) since it specifically reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis without increasing insulin secretion, inducing weight gain, or posing a risk of hypoglycemia1,2.\n For over half a century, this agent has been prescribed to T2D patients worldwide, yet the underlying mechanism by which metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis remains unknown.\n Here we show that metformin non-competitively inhibits the redox shuttle enzyme mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD), resulting in an altered hepatocellular redox state, reduced conversion of lactate and glycerol to glucose, and decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis.\n Acute and chronic low-dose metformin treatment effectively reduced endogenous glucose production (EGP), while increasing cytosolic redox and decreasing mitochondrial redox states.\n Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) knockdown of hepatic mGPD in rats resulted in a phenotype akin to chronic metformin treatment, and abrogated metformin-mediated increases in cytosolic redox state, decrease in plasma glucose concentrations and inhibition of EGP.\n These findings were replicated in whole-body mGPD knockout mice.\n These results have significant

This sex-specific finding is consistent with metformin’s reduction of TNF? in females over males, and suggests that metformin conveys protection in Covid-19 through TNF? effects.\n\n Prospective studies are needed to understand mechanism and causality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7325185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carolyn T.","surname":"Bramante","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas E.","surname":"Ingraham","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas A.","surname":"Murray","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Schelomo","surname":"Marmor","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shane","surname":"Hovertsen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jessica","surname":"Gronski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chace","surname":"McNeil","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruoying","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabriel","surname":"Guzman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nermine","surname":"Abdelwahab","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Samantha","surname":"King","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Meehan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kathryn M.","surname":"Pendleton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bradley","surname":"Benson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Deneen","surname":"Vojta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher J.","surname":"Tignanelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.2337/dc20-0660","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 in association with glucose-lowering medication","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.07.29.20164020","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Metformin use is associated with reduced mortality in a diverse population with COVID-19 and diabetes","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.dsx.2020.07.044","date":"2020-07-23","title":"Thyroid disease is associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection","abstract":"","id":"PMC7387272","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Timotius Ivan","surname":"Hariyanto","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Andree","surname":"Kurniawan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.dsx.2020.07.054","date":"2020-07-30","title":"Dyslipidemia is associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection","abstract":"Background and aims\nThe number of positive and death cases from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still increasing.\n\n The identification of risk factors for severe outcomes is important.\n\n Dyslipidemia has been shown as a long-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\n\n The aim of this study is to analyze the potential association between dyslipidemia and the severity of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe systematically searched the PubMed database using specific keywords related to our aims until July 9th, 2020.

have implicated the presence of the clotting initiator protein, tissue factor (TF), in circulating tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) with thrombotic manifestations in certain cancer types.\n Tumor cells, as well as tumor-derived EVs, may activate and promote platelet aggregation by TF-dependent and independent pathways.\n Cancer cells and their secreted EVs may also facilitate the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which may contribute to thrombus development.\n Alternatively, the presence of polyphosphate (polyP) in tumor-derived EVs may promote thrombosis through a TF-independent route.\n We conclude that the contribution of EVs to cancer coagulopathy is quite complex, in which one or more mechanisms may take place in a certain cancer type.\n In this

are jointly activated by the same stimuli and engaged in the regulation of the same processes.\n\n\nRecent Findings\nid='Par2'>Angiotensin II (Ang II) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), which are the main active compounds of the RAS and the VPS, interact at several levels.\n\n Firstly, Ang II, acting on AT1 receptors (AT1R), plays a significant role in the release of AVP from vasopressinergic neurons and AVP, stimulating V1a receptors (V1aR), regulates the release of renin in the kidney.\n\n Secondly, Ang II and AVP, acting on AT1R and V1aR, respectively, exert vasoconstriction, increase cardiac contractility, stimulate the sympathoadrenal system, and elevate blood pressure.\n\n At the same time, they act antagonistically in the regulation of blood pressure by baroreflex.\n\n Thirdly, the cooperative action of Ang II acting on AT1R and AVP stimulating both V1aR and V2 receptors in the kidney is necessary for the appropriate regulation of renal blood flow and the efficient resorption of sodium and water.\n\n Furthermore, both peptides enhance the release of aldosterone and potentiate its action in the renal tubules.\n\n\nSummary\nid='Par3'>In this review, we (1) point attention to the role of the cooperative action of Ang II and AVP for the regulation of blood pressure and the water-electrolyte balance under physiological conditions, (2) present the subcellular mechanisms underlying interactions of these two peptides, and (3) provide evidence that dysregulation of the cooperative action of Ang II and AVP significantly contributes to the development of disturbances in the regulation of blood pressure and the water-electrolyte balance in cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5859051","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ewa","surname":"Szczepanska-Sadowska","email":"eszczepanska@wum.edu.pl","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katarzyna","surname":"Czarzasta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Agnieszka","surname":"Cudnoch-Jedrzejewska","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1042/CS20080066","date":"2008-10-09","title":"AMP-activated protein kinase pathway: a potential therapeutic target in cardiometabolic disease","abstract":"AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is a heterotrimetric enzyme that is expressed in many tissues, including the heart and vasculature, and plays a central role in the regulation of energy homoeostasis.\n It is activated in response to stresses that lead to an increase in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio caused either by inhibition of ATP production (i.\ne.\n anoxia or ischaemia) or by accelerating ATP consumption (i.\ne.\n muscle contraction or fasting).\n In the heart, AMPK activity increases during ischaemia and functions to sustain ATP, cardiac function and myocardial viability.\n There is increasing evidence that AMPK is implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.\n A principle mode of AMPK activation is phosphorylation by upstream kinases [e.\ng.\n LKB1 and CaMK (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase], which leads to direct effects on tissues and phosphorylation of various downstream kinases [e.\ng.\n eEF2 (eukaryotic elongation factor 2) kinase and p70 S6 kinase].\n These upstream and downstream kinases of AMPK have fundamental roles in glucose metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, protein synthesis and tumour suppression; consequently, they have been implicated in cardiac ischaemia, arrhythmias and hypertrophy.\n Recent mechanistic studies have shown that AMPK has an important role in the mechanism of action of MF (metformin), TDZs (thiazolinediones) and statins.\n Increased understanding of the beneficial effects of AMPK

AMPK-Dependent Pathway in Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocytes","abstract":"Diabetes Mellitus is a common disorder, with increasing risk of cardiac arrhythmias.\n Studies have shown that altered connexin expression and gap junction remodeling under hyperglycemia contribute to the high prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias and even sudden death.\n Connexin 43 (Cx43), a major protein that assembles to form cardiac gap junctions, has been found to be downregulated under high glucose conditions, along with inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC).\n While, apelin, a beneficial adipokine, increases Cx43 protein expression in mouse and human embryonic stem cells during cardiac differentiation.\n However, it remains unknown whether apelin influences GJIC capacity in cardiomyocytes.\n Here, using Western blotting and dye transfer assays, we found that Cx43 protein expression was reduced and GJIC was impaired after treatment with high glucose, which, however, could be abrogated after apelin treatment for 48 h.\n We also found that apelin increased Cx43 expression under normal glucose.\n Real-time PCR showed that the Cx43 mRNA was not significantly affected under high glucose conditions in the presence of apelin or high glucose and apelin.\n High glucose decreased the phosphorylation of AMPK?; however, apelin activated AMPK?.\n Interestingly, we found that Cx43 expression was increased after treatment with AICAR, an activator of AMPK signaling.\n AMPK? inhibition mediated with transfection of siRNA-AMPK?1 and siRNA-AMPK?2 abolished the protective effect of apelin on Cx43 expression.\n Our data suggest that apelin attenuates high glucose-induced Cx43 downregulation and improves the loss of functional gap junctions partly through the AMPK

functions throughout the body.\n The classical view of this system saw it as a sequence of many enzymatic steps that culminate in the production of a single biologically active metabolite, the octapeptide angiotensin (ANG) II, by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).\n The past two decades have revealed new functions for some of the intermediate products, beyond their roles as substrates along the classical route.\n They may be processed in alternative ways by enzymes such as the ACE homolog ACE2. One effect is to establish a second axis through ACE2/ANG-(1–7)/MAS, whose end point is the metabolite ANG-(1–7).\n ACE2 and other enzymes can form ANG-(1–7) directly or indirectly from either the decapeptide ANG I or from ANG II.\n In many cases, this second axis appears to counteract or modulate the effects of the classical axis.\n ANG-(1–7) itself acts on the receptor MAS to influence a range of mechanisms in the heart, kidney, brain, and other tissues.\n This review highlights the current knowledge about the roles of ANG-(1–7) in physiology and disease, with particular emphasis on

the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system previously demonstrated to have therapeutic potential in hypertensive cardiomyopathy when administered via osmotic mini-pump.\n\n Here, we investigate whether gene transfer of Ang-(1-9) is cardioprotective in a murine model of myocardial infarction (MI).\n\n\nObjectives\nThe authors evaluated effects of Ang-(1-9) gene therapy on myocardial structural and functional remodeling post-infarction.\n\n\nMethods\nC57BL/6 mice underwent permanent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation and cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography for 8 weeks followed by a terminal measurement of left ventricular pressure volume loops.\n\n Ang-(1-9) was delivered by adeno-associated viral vector via single tail vein injection immediately following induction of MI.\n\n Direct effects of Ang-(1-9) on cardiomyocyte excitation/contraction coupling and cardiac contraction were evaluated in isolated mouse and human cardiomyocytes and in an ex vivo Langendorff-perfused whole-heart model.\n\n\nResults\nGene delivery of Ang-(1-9) reduced sudden cardiac death post-MI.\n\n Pressure volume measurements revealed complete restoration of end-systolic pressure, ejection fraction, end-systolic volume, and the end-diastolic pressure volume relationship by Ang-(1-9) treatment.\n\n Stroke volume and cardiac output were significantly increased versus sham.\n\n Histological analysis revealed only mild effects on cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, but a significant increase in scar thickness.\n\n Direct assessment of Ang-(1-9) on isolated cardiomyocytes demonstrated a positive inotropic effect via increasing calcium transient amplitude and contractility.\n\n Ang-(1-9) increased contraction in the Langendorff model through a protein kinase A–dependent mechanism.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur novel findings showed that Ang-(1-9) gene therapy preserved left ventricular systolic function post-MI, restoring cardiac function.\n\n Furthermore, Ang-(1-9) directly affected cardiomyocyte calcium handling through a protein kinase A–dependent mechanism.\n\n These data emphasized Ang-(1-9) gene therapy as a potential new strategy in the context of MI.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5158000","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Caroline","surname":"Fattah","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Katrin","surname":"Nather","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charlotte

displays significantly tighter binding to ADP than to Mg.\nATP, explaining how the enzyme is regulated under physiological conditions where the concentration of Mg.\nATP is higher than that of ADP and much higher than that of AMP.\n We have determined the crystal structure of an active AMPK complex.\n It shows how the activation loop of the kinase domain is stabilized by the regulatory domain and how the kinase linker region interacts with the regulatory nucleotide binding site that mediates protection against dephosphorylation.\n From our biochemical and structural data we develop a model for how the energy status of a cell regulates AMPK activity (Supplementary Fig.\n

renal programming increases the risk for developing hypertension and kidney disease in adulthood.\n Conversely, reprogramming is a strategy aimed at reversing the programming processes in early life.\n AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role in normal renal physiology and the pathogenesis of hypertension and kidney disease.\n This review discusses the regulation of AMPK in the kidney and provides hypothetical mechanisms linking AMPK to renal programming.\n This will be followed by studies targeting AMPK activators like metformin, resveratrol, thiazolidinediones, and polyphenols as reprogramming strategies to prevent hypertension and kidney disease.\n Further studies that broaden our understanding of AMPK isoform- and tissue-specific effects on renal programming are needed to ultimately develop reprogramming strategies.\n Despite the fact that animal models have provided interesting results with regard to reprogramming strategies targeting AMPK signaling to protect against hypertension and kidney disease with developmental origins, these results await further clinical

In kidneys, Ang II plays an important role in the development of proteinuria by the modification of podocyte molecules.\n We have previously found that Ang II suppressed podocyte AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) via Ang II type 1 receptor and MAPK signaling pathway.\n In the present study, we investigated the roles of AMPK on the changes of p130Cas of podocyte by Ang II.\n We cultured mouse podocytes and treated them with various concentrations of Ang II and AMPK-modulating agents and analyzed the changes of p130Cas by confocal imaging and western blotting.\n In immunofluorescence study, Ang II decreased the intensity of p130Cas and changed its localization from peripheral cytoplasm into peri-nuclear areas in a concentrated pattern in podocytes.\n Ang II also reduced the amount of p130Cas in time and dose-sensitive manners.\n AMPK activators, metformin and AICAR, restored the suppressed and mal-localized p130Cas significantly, whereas, compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, further aggravated the changes of p130Cas.\n Losartan, an Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist, recovered the abnormal changes of p130Cas suppressed by Ang II.\n These results suggest that Ang II induces the relocalization and suppression of podocyte p130Cas by the suppression of AMPK via Ang II type 1 receptor, which would contribute to Ang II-induced podocyte injury.\n","id":"PMC4810335","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tae-Sun","surname":"Ha","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hye-Young","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Hye-Young","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su-Bin","surname":"Seong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hee-Yul","surname":"Ahn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/jcp.21931","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Globular

adipocytes (brown-like adipocytes in white adipose tissue, WAT), and stimulating brown and beige adipocyte formation can be a new avenue to treat obesity.\n Angiotensin II (AngII) is a peptide hormone that plays important roles in energy metabolism via its angiotensin type 1 or type 2 receptors (AT1R and AT2R).\n Adipose tissue is a major source of AngII and expresses both types of its receptors, implying the autocrine and paracrine role of AngII in regulating adipose functions and self-remodeling.\n Here, based on the in vitro studies on primary cultures of mouse white adipocytes, we report that, AT2R activation, either by AngII or AT2R agonist (C21), induces white adipocyte browning, by increasing PPAR? expression, at least in part, via ERK1/2, PI3kinase/Akt and AMPK signaling pathways.\n It is also found that AngII–AT2R enhances brown adipogenesis.\n In the in vivo studies on mice, administration of AT1R antagonist (ZD7155) or AT2R agonist (C21) leads to the increase of WAT browning, body temperature and serum adiponectin, as well as the decrease of WAT mass and the serum levels of TNF?, triglycerides and free fatty acids.\n In addition, AT2R-induced browning effect is also observed in human white adipocytes, as evidenced by the increased UCP1 expression and oxygen consumption.\n Finally, we provide evidence that AT2R plays important roles in hormone T3-induced white adipose browning.\n This study, for the first time, reveals the browning and brown adipogenic effects of AT2R and suggests a potential therapeutic target to combat obesity and related metabolic disorders.\n","id":"PMC5661636","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Aung","surname":"Than","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shaohai","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ru","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Melvin

Review of Classical and New Paradigms","abstract":"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is well-recognized as one of the oldest and most important regulators of arterial blood pressure, cardiovascular, and renal function.\n New frontiers have recently emerged in the RAS research well beyond its classic paradigm as a potent vasoconstrictor, an aldosterone release stimulator, or a sodium-retaining hormone.\n First, two new members of the RAS have been uncovered, which include the renin/(Pro)renin receptor (PRR) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n Recent studies suggest that prorenin may act on the PRR independent of the classical ACE/ANG II/AT1 receptor axis, whereas ACE2 may degrade ANG II to generate ANG (1–7), which activates the Mas receptor.\n Second, there is increasing evidence that ANG II may function as an intracellular peptide to activate intracellular and/or nuclear receptors.\n Third, currently there is a debate on the relative contribution of systemic versus intrarenal RAS to the physiological regulation of blood pressure and the development of hypertension.\n The objectives of this article are to review and discuss the new insights and perspectives derived from recent studies using novel transgenic mice that either overexpress or are deficient of one key enzyme, ANG peptide, or receptor of the RAS.\n This information may help us better

were collected for analyses.\n\n AMPK, SIRT-1, and Beclin-1 expression was determined in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated HepG2 cells with or without FO emulsion treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIntestinal I/R induced significant liver morphological changes and increased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels.\n\n Expression of p-AMPK/AMPK, SIRT-1, and autophagy markers was decreased whereas tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) and malonaldehyde (MDA) were increased.\n\n FO emulsion blocked the changes of the above indicators effectively.\n\n Besides, in LPS-stimulated HepG2 cells, small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting AMPK impaired the FO induced increase of p-AMPK, SIRT-1, and Beclin-1 and decrease of TNF-? and MDA.\n\n SIRT-1 siRNA impaired the increase of SIRT-1 and Beclin-1 and the decrease of TNF-? and MDA.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study indicates that FO may protect the liver against intestinal I/R induced injury through the AMPK/SIRT-1/autophagy pathway.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5807941","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hui-Rong","surname":"Jing","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fu-Wen","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xing-Ming","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Feng","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Zhou","email":"zydy2ynutrition@126.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Atractylenolide

This study was conducted to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects and the associated mechanisms of adiponectin (APN) on IH induced human adult cardiac myocytes (HACMs) injury.\n\n\nMaterial/Methods\nHACMs were exposed to normoxia or IH (1% to 21% O2) using a novel cell culture bio-reactor with gas-permeable membranes.\n\n Cell viability was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay.\n\n Cell membrane integrity was assessed by the detection of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release.\n\n Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels were determined using specific assay kits.\n\n P-AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), p-LKB1, and p-p65 protein levels were measured by western blotting.\n\n Pro-inflammatory factors including interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, IL-8 expressions were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain

in cigarette smoking-induced inflammation.\n\n\nMaterial/Methods\nCigarette smoking extract (CSE) was employed to induce inflammation in bronchial epithelial cells (BECs).\n\n After CSE administration, several autophagy-related proteins (Beclin1, autophagy-related gene (ATG)5, ATG7, p62, and LC3) and PPAR? levels were examined by western blot.\n\n Subsequently, PPAR? agonists and antagonist were used to treat CSE-induced BECs, several inflammatory factors (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2) and autophagy-related proteins were detected to measure the inflammatory and autophagy levels.\n\n Then LC3 knockdown was performed to verify the role of autophagy in CSE-induced inflammation.\n\n Finally, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream S6 kinase (S6K) were detected in CSE-stimulated BECs.\n\n\nResults\nCSE administration caused insufficient autophagy and the decrease of PPAR?

The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing.\n The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus.\n The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications.\n Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1–7 analogs, and

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12

(Review)","abstract":"id='P3'>The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway senses and responds to nutrient availability, energy sufficiency, stress, hormones and mitogens to modulate protein synthesis.\n Rapamycin is a bacterial product that can inhibit mTOR via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.\n mTOR signaling is necessary for the development of influenza and modulates the antibody response to provide cross-protective immunity to lethal infection with influenza virus.\n In one human study, it was found that the treatment of severe H1N1 influenza?related pneumonia with rapamycin and steroids improved the outcome.\n However, in other studies, immunosuppression with systemic steroids, and possibly rapamycin as well, was associated with an increased morbidity/mortality and a prolonged viral replication.\n In order to avoid the systemic side-effects, some investigators have postulated that the inhalation of rapamycin would be desirable.\n However, the inhalation of rapamycin, with its well-documented lung toxicity, could be contraindicated.\n Another class of drug, biguanides, can also inhibit mTOR, but have no lung toxicity.\n Biguanides are widely used small molecule drugs prescribed as oral anti-diabetics that have exhibited considerable promise in oncology.\n During the 1971 outbreak of influenza, diabetic patients treated with the biguanides, phenformin and buformin, had a lower incidence of infection than diabetics treated with sulfonylureas or insulin.\n Both buformin and phenformin reduce the mortality of influenza in mice; phenformin is less effective than buformin.\n The inhalation of buformin or phenformin for influenza may be an effective novel treatment strategy that would limit the risk of systemic side-effects associated with biguanides due to the low inhaled dose.\n Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus closely related to the SARS virus.\n The disease is the cause of the 2019–2020 coronavirus outbreak.\n It is primarily spread between individuals via small droplets emitted from infected individuals when breathing or coughing.\n PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling responses play important roles in MERS-CoV infection and may represent a novel drug target for therapeutic intervention strategies.\n The present review article discusses the effects of biguanides on influenza and coronavirus.\n","id":"PMC7170270","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"STEVEN","surname":"LEHRER","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/AAC.03659-14","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Antiviral

acute diabetes","abstract":"Multiple organ damage in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients is common; however, the pathogenesis remains controversial.\n This study was to determine whether the damage was correlated with expression of the SARS coronavirus receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in different organs, especially in the endocrine tissues of the pancreas, and to elucidate the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance in SARS patients.\n The effect of clinical variables on survival was estimated in 135 SARS patients who died, 385 hospitalized SARS patients who survived, and 19 patients with non-SARS pneumonia.\n A total of 39 SARS patients who had no previous diabetes and received no steroid treatment were compared to 39 matched healthy siblings during a 3-year follow-up period.\n The pattern of SARS coronavirus receptor-ACE2 proteins in different human organs was also studied.\n Significant elevations in oxygen saturation, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase MB isoenzyme, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), but not in alanine transaminase were predictors for death.\n Abundant ACE2 immunostaining was found in lung, kidney, heart, and islets of pancreas, but not in hepatocytes.\n Twenty of the 39 followed-up patients were diabetic during hospitalization.\n After 3 years, only two of these patients had diabetes.\n Compared with their non-SARS siblings, these patients exhibited no significant differences in FPG, postprandial glucose (PPG), and insulin levels.\n The organ involvements of SARS correlated with organ expression of ACE2. The localization of ACE2 expression in the endocrine part of the pancreas suggests that SARS coronavirus enters islets using ACE2 as its receptor and damages islets causing acute diabetes.\n","id":"PMC7088164","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jin-Kui","surname":"Yang","email":"yangjk@trhos.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shan-Shan","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Juan","surname":"Ji","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Li-Min","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108146","date":"2020-04-04","title":"Should

microbiome and microbiota and provide a comprehensive discussion considering the composition of microbiota, the heterogeneity and dynamics of microbiomes in time and space, the stability and resilience of microbial networks, the definition of core microbiomes, and functionally relevant keystone species as well as co-evolutionary principles of microbe-host and inter-species interactions within the microbiome.\n These broad definitions together with the suggested unifying concepts will help to improve standardization of microbiome studies in the future, and could be the starting point

in the development of endometrial cancer","abstract":"Background\nEndometrial cancer studies have led to a number of well-defined but mechanistically unconnected genetic and environmental risk factors.\n\n One of the emerging modulators between environmental triggers and genetic expression is the microbiome.\n\n We set out to inquire about the composition of the uterine microbiome and its putative role in endometrial cancer.\n\n\nMethods\nWe undertook a study of the microbiome in samples taken from different locations along the female reproductive tract in patients with endometrial cancer (n?=?17), patients with endometrial hyperplasia (endometrial cancer precursor, n?=?4), and patients afflicted with benign uterine conditions (n?=?10).\n\n Vaginal, cervical, Fallopian, ovarian, peritoneal, and urine samples were collected aseptically both in the operating room and the pathology laboratory.\n\n DNA extraction was followed by amplification and high-throughput next generation sequencing (MiSeq) of the 16S rDNA V3-V5 region to identify the microbiota present.\n\n Microbiota data were summarized using both ?-diversity to reflect species richness and evenness within bacterial populations and ?-diversity to reflect the shared diversity between bacterial populations.\n\n Statistical significance was determined through the use of multiple testing, including the generalized mixed-effects model.\n\n\nResults\nThe microbiome sequencing (16S rDNA V3-V5 region) revealed that the microbiomes of all organs (vagina, cervix, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries) are significantly correlated (p?&lt;?0.001) and that there is a structural microbiome shift in the cancer and hyperplasia cases, distinguishable from the benign cases (p?=?0.01).\n\n Several taxa were found to be significantly enriched in samples belonging to the endometrial cancer cohort: Firmicutes (Anaerostipes, ph2, Dialister, Peptoniphilus, 1–68, Ruminococcus, and Anaerotruncus), Spirochaetes (Treponema), Actinobacteria (Atopobium), Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides and Porphyromonas), and Proteobacteria (Arthrospira).\n\n Of particular relevance, the simultaneous presence of Atopobium vaginae and an uncultured representative of the Porphyromonas sp.\n\n (99 % match to P.\n\n somerae) were found to be associated with disease status, especially if combined with a high vaginal pH (&gt;4.5).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results suggest that the detection of A.\n\n vaginae and the identified Porphyromonas sp.\n\n in the gynecologic tract combined with a high vaginal pH is statistically associated with the presence of endometrial cancer.\n\n Given the documented association of the identified microorganisms with other pathologies, these findings raise the possibility of a microbiome role in the manifestation, etiology, or progression of endometrial cancer that should be further investigated.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

for maintaining gynecological and reproductive health.\n Apart from host genetics, infections, changes in diet, life-style and hygiene status are known to affect this delicate state of equilibrium.\n More importantly, the gonadal hormones strongly influence the overall structure and function of vaginal microbiota.\n Several studies have attempted to understand (a) the composition of vaginal microbiota in specific stages of women’s reproductive cycle as well as in menopause (b) their association with gonadal hormones, and their potential role in manifestation of specific health conditions (from the perspective of cause/consequence).\n However, a single study that places, in context, the structural variations of the vaginal microbiome across the entire life-span of women’s reproductive cycle and during various stages of menopause is currently lacking.\n With the objective to obtain a holistic overview of the community dynamics of vaginal micro-environment ‘across’ various stages of women’s reproductive and post-reproductive life-cycle, we have performed a meta-analysis of approximately 1,000 vaginal microbiome samples representing various stages of the reproductive cycle and menopausal states.\n Objectives of this analysis included (a) understanding temporal changes in vaginal community taxonomic structure and composition as women pass through various reproductive and menopausal stages (b) exploring correlations between the levels of female sex hormones with vaginal microbiome diversity (c) analyzing changes in the pattern of community diversity in cases of dysbiotic conditions such as bacterial vaginosis, and viewing the analyzed changes in the context of a healthy state.\n Results reveal interesting temporal trends with respect to vaginal microbial community diversity and its pattern of correlation with host physiology.\n Results indicate significant differences in alpha-diversity and overall vaginal microbial community members in various reproductive and post-reproductive phases.\n In addition to reinforcing the known influence/role of gonadal hormones in maintaining gynecological health, results indicate how hormonal level perturbations cause/contribute to imbalances in vaginal microbiota.\n The nature of resulting dysbiotic state and its influence on vaginal health is also analyzed and discussed.\n Results also suggest that elevated vaginal microbial diversity in pregnancy does not necessarily indicate a state of bacterial infection.\n The study puts forward a hormone-level driven microbiome diversity hypothesis for explaining temporal patterns in vaginal microbial diversity during various stages of women’s reproductive cycle and at menopause.\n","id":"PMC7136476","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Harrisham","surname":"Kaur","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mitali","surname":"Merchant","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohammed

Human Vaginal Microbiome Unique?","abstract":"The human vaginal microbiome is dominated by bacteria from the genus Lactobacillus, which create an acidic environment thought to protect women against sexually transmitted pathogens and opportunistic infections.\n Strikingly, lactobacilli dominance appears to be unique to humans; while the relative abundance of lactobacilli in the human vagina is typically &gt;70%, in other mammals lactobacilli rarely comprise more than 1% of vaginal microbiota.\n Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain humans' unique vaginal microbiota, including humans' distinct reproductive physiology, high risk of STDs, and high risk of microbial complications linked to pregnancy and birth.\n Here, we test these hypotheses using comparative data on vaginal pH and the relative abundance of lactobacilli in 26 mammalian species and 50 studies (N = 21 mammals for pH and 14 mammals for lactobacilli relative abundance).\n We found that non-human mammals, like humans, exhibit the lowest vaginal pH during the period of highest estrogen.\n However, the vaginal pH of non-human mammals is never as low as is typical for humans (median vaginal pH in humans = 4.5; range of pH across all 21 non-human mammals = 5.4–7.8).\n Contrary to disease and obstetric risk hypotheses, we found no significant relationship between vaginal pH or lactobacilli relative abundance and multiple metrics of STD or birth injury risk (P-values ranged from 0.13 to 0.99).\n Given the lack of evidence for these hypotheses, we discuss two alternative explanations: the common function hypothesis and a novel hypothesis related to the diet of agricultural humans.\n Specifically, with regard to diet we propose that high levels of starch in human diets have led to increased levels of glycogen in the vaginal tract, which, in turn, promotes the proliferation of lactobacilli.\n If true, human diet may have paved the way for a novel, protective microbiome in human vaginal tracts.\n Overall, our results highlight the need for continuing research on non-human vaginal microbial communities and the importance of investigating both the physiological mechanisms and the broad evolutionary processes underlying human lactobacilli dominance.\n","id":"PMC5143676","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Elizabeth

of the Vaginal Microbiomes of Premenopausal and Postmenopausal Women","abstract":"For decades hormone therapy (HT) has been prescribed to treat the symptoms of menopause, such as vaginal dryness, itching and burning.\n Here we sought to compare the vaginal microbiomes of postmenopausal women who received low dose estrogen therapy to those of premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and to do so in conjunction with assessing the alleviation of symptoms associated with vaginal atrophy.\n In this study vaginal swab samples were obtained from 45 women who were classified as either premenopausal, postmenopausal, or postmenopausal and undergoing HT.\n The vaginal microbiomes of these women were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bacterial abundances were quantified by qPCR.\n We found that the vaginal communities from our cohort could be divided into six clusters (A-F) based on differences in the composition and relative abundances of bacterial taxa.\n Communities in cluster A were dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus, and those of cluster B were dominated by Gardnerella vaginalis.\n Communities in cluster C had high proportions of L.\n iners, while those in cluster D were more even and included several co-dominant taxa.\n Communities in clusters E and F were dominated by Bifidobacterium and L.\n gasseri, respectively.\n The vaginal communities of most postmenopausal women receiving HT (10/15) were dominated by species of lactobacilli and belonged to clusters A, C, and F (P &lt; 0.001).\n This sharply contrasts with vaginal communities of postmenopausal women without HT, most of which (10/15) were in cluster D, depleted of lactobacilli, and had about 10-fold fewer total bacteria (P &lt; 0.05).\n The vaginal communities of women in each study group differed in terms of the dominant bacterial species composition and relative abundance.\n Those of postmenopausal women receiving HT significantly differed from those of postmenopausal

the complete microbiota in the vaginal fluid of women who responded to antibiotic therapy and compared it to the activity of the microbiota in women who did not respond.\n We found that one of the most important pathogens in bacterial vaginosis, Gardnerella vaginalis, has activated genes that can repair the DNA damage caused by the antibiotic in those women that do not respond to therapy.\n

using Amsel's criteria were evaluated daily for 7 or 14 days, then at 2, 3 and 4 weeks, using a panel of 11 bacterium-specific quantitative PCR assays.\n\n Participants with BV were treated with 5 days of intravaginal metronidazole.\n\n Participants without BV had vaginal biotas dominated by lactobacilli, whose levels fluctuated with menses.\n\n With onset of menstruation, quantities of

women.\n\n\nMethods\n1093 women aged 16–25 years were recruited from primary-care clinics.\n\n Participants completed 3-monthly questionnaires and self-collected vaginal smears 6-monthly for 12-months.\n\n The primary endpoint was a Nugent Score?=?7–10 (BV) and the secondary endpoint was a NS?=?4–10 (abnormal flora [AF]).\n\n BV and AF prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were derived, and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) calculated to explore epidemiological associations with prevalent BV and AF.\n\n Proportional-hazards regression models were used to examine factors associated with incident BV and AF.\n\n\nResults\nAt baseline 129 women had BV [11.8% (95%CI: 9.4–14.2)] and 188 AF (17.2%; 15.1–19.5).\n\n Prevalent BV was associated with having a recent

In contrast, bacterial vaginosis (BV), a dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiota, is characterized by decreased lactic acid-producing microbiota and increased diverse anaerobic bacteria accompanied by an elevated pH&gt;4.5.

the potential role of Lactobacillus in female infertility has remained largely unexplored.\n In the present study, high-throughput sequencing, real-time PCR, bacterial adherence assays and sperm motility assays were used to evaluate the microbial diversity, adherence properties and effect on sperm motility of sperm bacteria, vaginal bacteria and vaginal bacteria that had been co-cultured with sperm.\n The results indicated that in the co-culture group, Lactobacillus adhered to sperm cells in numbers that were 332-fold higher than those of control species Enterococcus and analysis of sequencing data using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes indicated that adhered microbes reduced sperm cell motility.\n Vaginal isolates, as well as bacterial strains used as controls, were co-cultured with sperm and it was indicated that all strains were able to adhere to sperm cells in large numbers.\n The probiotic Lactobacillus (L.\n) strains L.\n crispatus, L.\n acidophilus, L.\n helveticus and L.\n gasseri significantly reduced sperm motility (based on measurements of general, straightforward and non-straightforward progressive motility, total motility and average path velocity; P&lt;0.05).\n Furthermore, L.\n crispatus, L.\n acidophilus, L.\n salivarius, L.\n helveticus and L.\n gasseri markedly reduced sperm penetration in a viscous medium.\n Based on these

and to document associations between cervical microbiota, cervical inflammatory response, microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC), histological chorioamnionitis, and intraamniotic infection (IAI).\n\n\nStudy Design\nSixty-one women with singleton pregnancies complicated by PPROM were included in the study.\n\n Specimens of cervical and amniotic fluid were collected on admission.\n\n The cervical microbiota was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing by pyrosequencing.\n\n Interleukin (IL)-6 concentration in the cervical fluid and amniotic fluid was measured by ELISA and lateral flow

associated with its expression of a broad array of proteases triggering cytotoxic effects in host epithelial cells.\n Vaginal microbiota-associated Lactobacillus, including those of L.\n gasseri in particular, can counteract T.\n vaginalis pathogenesis, but the mechanisms involved have yet to be clarified.\n T.\n vaginalis strain G3 (Tv G3) cytotoxicity was assessed by examining cell morphology, cell detachment, and fluorescent labeling of the F-actin cytoskeleton and immunolabeling of vinculin-position focal adhesions (FAs) by confocal laser scanning electron microscopy on confluent cervicovaginal epithelial HeLa cell monolayers.\n The inhibitory effects of bacterial cells and secreted products of L.\n gasseri ATCC 9857 and KS 120.1 on the Tv G3 viability and parasite deleterious effects on HeLa cells were investigated.\n Pre-adhering L.\n gasseri cells delayed but did not inhibit Tv G3-induced cell detachment, F-actin cytoskeleton disorganization and the disappearance of vinculin-positive focal FAs.\n L.\n gasseri KS 120.1 secretion products had a rapid parasiticide activity by killing time- and concentration-dependent Tv G3 parasites after direct contact.\n By killing Tv G3 parasites already associated with the epithelial cells, secretion products have abolished parasite-induced cell detachment.\n Our findings suggest that vagina microbiota-associated L.\n gasseri creates a physical barrier and exerts pharmacological-type mechanisms to counteract the deleterious cytotoxic effects of T.\n vaginalis.\n","id":"PMC9696988","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Bénédicte","surname":"Pradines","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Séverine","surname":"Domenichini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vanessa","surname":"Lievin-Le

during the period from March 1 to May 11, 2020.\nMethods\nWe did a whole-population study assessing risks of in-hospital death with COVID-19 between March 1 and May 11, 2020. We included all individuals registered with a general practice in England who were alive on Feb 16, 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the effect of diabetes status, by type, on in-hospital death with COVID-19, adjusting for demographic factors and cardiovascular comorbidities.\n\n Because of the absence of data on total numbers of people infected with COVID-19 during the observation period, we calculated mortality rates for the population as a whole, rather than the population who were infected.\n\n\nFindings\nOf the 61?414?470 individuals who were alive and registered with a general practice on Feb 16, 2020, 263?830 (0·4%) had a recorded diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, 2?864?670 (4·7%) had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, 41?750 (0·1%) had other types of diabetes, and 58?244?220 (94·8%) had no diabetes.\n\n 23?698 in-hospital COVID-19-related deaths occurred during the study period.\n\n A third occurred in people with diabetes: 7434 (31·4%) in people with type 2 diabetes, 364 (1·5%) in those with type 1 diabetes, and 69 (0·3%) in people with other types of diabetes.\n\n Unadjusted mortality rates per 100?000 people over the 72-day period were 27 (95% CI 27–28) for those without diabetes, 138 (124–153) for those with type 1 diabetes, and 260 (254–265) for those with type 2 diabetes.\n\n Adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity, and geographical region, compared with people without diabetes, the odds ratios (ORs) for in-hospital COVID-19-related death were 3·51 (95% CI 3·16–3·90) in people with type 1 diabetes and 2·03 (1·97–2·09) in people with type 2 diabetes.\n\n These effects were attenuated to ORs of 2·86 (2·58–3·18) for type 1 diabetes and 1·80 (1·75–1·86) for type 2 diabetes when also adjusted for previous hospital admissions with coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or heart

risk factors, including hyperglycaemia and obesity, and COVID-19-related mortality among people with diabetes is unclear.\n\n We assessed associations between risk factors and COVID-19-related mortality in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a population-based cohort study of people with diagnosed diabetes who were registered with a general practice in England.\n\n National population data on people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes collated by the National Diabetes Audit were linked to mortality records collated by the Office for National Statistics from Jan 2, 2017, to May 11, 2020. We identified the weekly number of deaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the first 19 weeks of 2020 and calculated the percentage change from the mean number of deaths for the corresponding weeks in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The associations between risk factors (including sex, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, HbA1c, renal impairment [from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)], BMI, tobacco smoking status, and cardiovascular comorbidities) and COVID-19-related mortality (defined as International Classification of Diseases, version 10, code U07.1 or U07.2 as a primary or secondary cause of death) between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, were investigated by use of Cox proportional hazards models.\n\n\nFindings\nWeekly death registrations in the first 19 weeks of 2020 exceeded the corresponding 3-year weekly averages for 2017–19 by 672 (50·9%) in people with type 1 diabetes and 16?071 (64·3%) in people with type 2 diabetes.\n\n Between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, among 264?390 people with type 1 diabetes and 2?874?020 people with type 2 diabetes, 1604 people with type 1 diabetes and 36?291 people with type 2 diabetes died from all causes.\n\n Of these total deaths, 464 in people with type 1 diabetes and 10?525 in people with type 2 diabetes were defined as COVID-19 related, of which 289 (62·3%) and 5833 (55·4%), respectively, occurred in people with a history of cardiovascular disease or with renal impairment (eGFR &lt;60 mL/min per 1·73 m2).\n\n Male sex, older age, renal impairment, non-white ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and previous stroke and heart failure were associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\n Compared with people with an HbA1c of 48–53 mmol/mol (6·5–7·0%), people with an HbA1c of 86 mmol/mol (10·0%) or higher had increased COVID-19-related mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2·23 [95% CI 1·50–3·30, p&lt;0·0001] in type 1 diabetes and 1·61 [1·47–1·77, p&lt;0·0001] in type 2 diabetes).\n\n In addition, in people with type 2 diabetes, COVID-19-related mortality was significantly higher in those with an HbA1c of 59 mmol/mol (7·6%) or higher than in those with an HbA1c of 48–53 mmol/mol (HR 1·22 [95% CI 1·15–1·30, p&lt;0·0001] for 59–74 mmol/mol [7·6–8·9%] and 1·36 [1·24–1·50, p&lt;0·0001] for 75–85 mmol/mol [9·0–9·9%]).\n\n The association between BMI and COVID-19-related mortality was U-shaped: in type 1 diabetes, compared with a BMI of 25·0–29·9 kg/m2, a BMI of less than 20·0 kg/m2 had an HR of 2·45 (95% CI 1·60–3·75, p&lt;0·0001) and a BMI of 40·0 kg/m2 or higher had an HR of 2·33 (1·53–3·56, p&lt;0·0001); the corresponding HRs for type 2 diabetes were 2·33 (2·11–2·56, p&lt;0·0001) and 1·60 (1·47–1·75, p&lt;0·0001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nDeaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes rose sharply during the initial COVID-19 pandemic in England.\n\n Increased COVID-19-related mortality was associated not only with cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes but, independently, also with glycaemic control and BMI.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7426091","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Naomi","surname":"Holman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Knighton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Partha","surname":"Kar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jackie","surname":"O'Keefe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matt","surname":"Curley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andy","surname":"Weaver","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emma","surname":"Barron","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chirag","surname":"Bakhai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kamlesh","surname":"Khunti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas

(SARS?CoV?2) Requiring Invasive Mechanical Ventilation","abstract":"Objective\nThe COVID?19 pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide, notably in Europe and North America where obesity is highly prevalent.\n\n The relation between obesity and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus?2 (SARS?CoV?2) has not been fully documented.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective cohort study analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, including BMI, and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for SARS?CoV?2 in a single French center.\n\n\nResults\nObesity (BMI?&gt;?30) and severe obesity (BMI?&gt;?35) were present in 47.6% and 28.2% of cases, respectively.\n\n Overall, 85 patients (68.6%) required IMV.\n\n The proportion of patients who required IMV increased with BMI categories (P?&lt;?0.01, ?2 test for trend), and it was greatest in patients with BMI?&gt;?35 (85.7%).\n\n In multivariate logistic regression, the need for IMV was significantly associated with male sex (P?&lt;?0.05) and BMI (P?&lt;?0.05), independent of age, diabetes, and hypertension.\n\n The odds ratio for IMV in patients with BMI?&gt;?35 versus patients with BMI?&lt;?25 was 7.36 (1.63?33.14; P?=?0.02).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe present study showed a high frequency of obesity among patients admitted in intensive care for SARS?CoV?2. Disease severity increased with BMI.\n\n Obesity is a risk factor for SARS?CoV?2 severity, requiring increased attention to preventive measures in susceptible individuals.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7262326","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Arthur","surname":"Simonnet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mikael","surname":"Chetboun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Julien","surname":"Poissy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Violeta","surname":"Raverdy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jerome","surname":"Noulette","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jerome","surname":"Noulette","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alain","surname":"Duhamel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Julien","surname":"Labreuche","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Mathieu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Francois","surname":"Pattou","email":"francois.pattou@univ-lille.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Merce","surname":"Jourdain","email":"mercedes.jourdain@univ-lille.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Merce","surname":"Jourdain","email":"mercedes.jourdain@univ-lille.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Caizzo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Caizzo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Morgan","surname":"Caplan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Cousin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thibault","surname":"Duburcq","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Arthur","surname":"Durand","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ahmed","surname":"El kalioubie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Raphael","surname":"Favory","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Garcia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Girardie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Julien","surname":"Goutay","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marion","surname":"Houard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emmanuelle","surname":"Jaillette","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Kostuj","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geoffrey","surname":"Ledoux","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Mathieu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anne Sophie","surname":"Moreau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Niles","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Saad","surname":"Nseir","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thierry","surname":"Onimus","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Erika","surname":"Parmentier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastien","surname":"Préau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laurent","surname":"Robriquet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anahita","surname":"Rouze","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sophie","surname":"Six","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hélène","surname":"Verkindt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/cid/ciaa415","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Obesity in patients younger than 60 years is a risk factor for Covid-19 hospital admission","abstract":"","id":"PMC7184372","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jennifer","surname":"Lighter","email":"Jennifer.Lighter@nyumc.org","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Phillips","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"Hochman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephanie","surname":"Sterling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Diane","surname":"Johnson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fritz","surname":"Francois","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Stachel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences;

factors in patients with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19: Findings from the CORONADO study and other recent reports","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus is challenging in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients.\n As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection.\n This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly China and the US.\n Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance.\n Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits.\n While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, but whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown.\n In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified.\n Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection.\n Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.\n","id":"PMC7241378","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"A.J.","surname":"Scheen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Marre","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"C.","surname":"Thivolet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMsa2011686","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hospitalization

morbidity and mortality outcomes of epidemics and pandemics.\n While racial disparities in cumulative incidence (CmI) and mortality from the influenza pandemics of 1918 and 2009 implicated Blacks with survival disadvantage relative to Whites in the United States, COVID-19 currently indicates comparable disparities.\n We aimed to: (a) assess COVID-19 CmI by race, (b) determine the Black–White case fatality (CF) and risk differentials, and (c) apply explanatory model for mortality risk differentials.\n Methods: COVID-19 data on confirmed cases and deaths by selective states health departments were assessed using a cross-sectional ecologic design.\n Chi-square was used for CF independence, while binomial regression model for the Black–White risk differentials.\n Results: The COVID-19 mortality CmI indicated Blacks/AA with 34% of the total mortality in the United States, albeit their 13% population size.\n The COVID-19 CF was higher among Blacks/AA relative to Whites; Maryland,

Emerging Threat of (Micro)Thrombosis in COVID-19 and Its Therapeutic Implications","abstract":"The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing global pandemic has presented a health emergency of unprecedented magnitude.\n Recent clinical data has highlighted that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a significant risk of thrombotic complications ranging from microvascular thrombosis, venous thromboembolic disease, and stroke.\n Importantly, thrombotic complications are markers of severe COVID-19 and are associated with multiorgan failure and increased mortality.\n The evidence to date supports the concept that the thrombotic manifestations of severe COVID-19 are due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to invade endothelial cells via ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which is expressed on the endothelial cell surface.\n However, in patients with COVID-19 the subsequent endothelial inflammation, complement activation, thrombin generation, platelet, and leukocyte recruitment, and the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses culminate in immunothrombosis, ultimately causing (micro)thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.\n Accordingly, the activation of coagulation (eg, as measured with plasma D-dimer) and thrombocytopenia have emerged as prognostic markers in COVID-19. Given thrombotic complications are central determinants of the high mortality rate in COVID-19, strategies to prevent thrombosis are of critical importance.\n Several antithrombotic drugs have been proposed as potential therapies to prevent COVID-19-associated thrombosis, including heparin, FXII inhibitors, fibrinolytic drugs, nafamostat, and dipyridamole, many of which also possess pleiotropic anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects.\n The growing awareness and mechanistic understanding of the prothrombotic state of COVID-19 patients are driving efforts to more stringent diagnostic screening for thrombotic complications and to the early institution of antithrombotic drugs, for both the prevention and therapy of thrombotic complications.\n The shifting paradigm of diagnostic and treatment strategies holds significant promise to reduce the burden of thrombotic complications and ultimately improve the prognosis for patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7386875","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"James D.","surname":"McFadyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hannah","surname":"Stevens","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Karlheinz","surname":"Peter","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1182/blood.2020006000","date":"2020-04-27","title":"COVID-19 and its implications for thrombosis and anticoagulation","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced infection can be associated with a coagulopathy, findings consistent with infection-induced inflammatory changes as observed in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).\n The lack of prior immunity to COVID-19 has resulted in large numbers of infected patients across the globe and uncertainty regarding management of the complications that arise in the course of this viral illness.\n The lungs are the target organ for COVID-19; patients develop acute lung injury that can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur.\n The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen-degradation products, whereas abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations.\n Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested.\n COVID-19–associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC.\n Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full-intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated.\n Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with COVID-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with DIC, have not been reported.\n If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of DIC and bleeding should be followed.\n","id":"PMC7273827","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jean M.","surname":"Connors","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jerrold H.","surname":"Levy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jvs.2020.05.015","date":"2020-05-05","title":"The need to manage the risk of thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients","abstract":"COVID-19 first appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019.

virus, especially to SARS-CoV-2, from the aspects of anatomical, reproductive endocrine and immune changes during pregnancy and screens effective and fetal-safe treatments from the existing drugs.\n The anatomical structure of the respiratory system is changed during pregnancy, and the virus transmitted by droplets and aerosols is more easily inhaled by pregnant women and is difficult to remove.\n Furthermore, the prognosis is worse after infection when compared with non-pregnancy women.\n And changes in reproductive hormones and immune systems during pregnancy collectively make them more susceptible to certain infections.\n More importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, has been proven highly increased during pregnancy, which may contribute to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. When it comes to treatment, specific drugs for COVID-19 have not been found at present, and taking old drugs for new use in treating COVID-19 has become an emergency method for the pandemic.\n Particularly, drugs that show superior maternal and fetal safety are worthy of consideration for pregnant women with COVID-19, such as chloroquine, metformin, statins, lobinavir/ritonavir, glycyrrhizic acid, and nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery (NMDD), etc.\n Pregnant women are susceptible to COVID-19, and special attention should be paid to the selection of drugs that are both effective for maternal diseases and friendly to the fetus.\n However, there are still many deficiencies in the study of drug safety during pregnancy, and broad-spectrum, effective and fetal-safe drugs for pregnant women need to be developed so as to cope with more infectious diseases in the future.\n","id":"PMC7178925","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaoxuan","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuepeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongyan","surname":"Xi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Qu","email":"syqufan@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoling","surname":"Feng","email":"Doctorfxl@163.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00125-020-05164-x","date":"2020-04-20","title":"Prevention and management of COVID-19 among patients with diabetes: an appraisal of the literature","abstract":"Electronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00125-020-05164-x) contains peer-reviewed but unedited supplementary material including a slideset of the figures for download, which is available to authorised users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7220850","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Prasad","surname":"Katulanda","email":"prasad.katulanda@clinmed.cmb.ac.lk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Harsha A.","surname":"Dissanayake","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Harsha A.","surname":"Dissanayake","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ishara","surname":"Ranathunga","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ishara","surname":"Ranathunga","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vithiya","surname":"Ratnasamy","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Vithiya","surname":"Ratnasamy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Piyumi S.

outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaolin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xingwang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuelei","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangfa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongmeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Wang","email":"wangjw28@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"caobin_ben@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Gong J, Dong H, Xia SQ, et al.

Report","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage.\n\n Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care.\n\n Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P&lt;0.001).\n\n The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization.\n\n In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs.\n\n 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs.\n\n 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs.\n\n 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.\n\n

increased risk of infections and early cardiovascular disease.\n\n By releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), neutrophils kill bacteria and exert pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic activities.\n\n Increased NETosis has been found in cross-sectional studies including treated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.\n\n In this study, we determined whether the ability of neutrophils to form NETs differs in diabetic patients pre- and post-hyperglycemic control versus healthy donors (HD), and the relationship between NETosis with pro-thrombotic, pro-inflammatory biomarkers and thrombotic clinical events.\n\n\nMethods\nDiabetic patients recently diagnosed and after 6 and 12 months of treatment (N = 25) and HD (N = 25) were included.\n\n NET formation was studied by microscopy and fluorometry.\n\n Nucleosomes, HNE-DNA complexes, von Willebrand factor (vWF), IL6 and TNF? plasma levels were measured by ELISA and P-selectin on the platelet surface was assessed by cytometry.\n\n\nResults\nBasal levels of NETs in recently diagnosed T2DM patients were higher compared to HD.\n\n While TNF? stimulation of control neutrophils resulted in DNA release, patient neutrophils were not responsive.\n\n Although glycemia decreased after 6 months of metformin treatment, basal and TNF? and PMA-stimulated NETs reached normal values after 12 months.\n\n Compared to controls, nucleosomes, HNE-DNA complexes, IL-6 and TNF? levels were increased in recently diagnosed patients and decreased after 12 months of treatment.\n\n P-selectin and vWF levels were similar in both populations.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur data suggest that NETs could represent a biomarker for T2DM.\n\n Increased NETosis in T2DM patients does not appear to be the consequence of impaired

tuberculosis (Mtb).\n Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the leading predisposing factors for development of TB after HIV/AIDS.\n Glibenclamide is a widely used anti-diabetic drug in low and middle-income countries where the incidence of TB is very high.\n In a human macrophage cell line, glibenclamide, a K+ATP-channel blocker, promoted alternative activation of macrophages by enhancing expression of the M2 marker CD206 during M2 polarization.\n M2 macrophages are considered poorly microbicidal and associated with TB susceptibility.\n Here, we investigated the effect of glibenclamide on M1 and M2 phenotypes of primary human monocytes and further determined whether specific drug treatment for T2DM individuals influences the antibacterial function of monocytes in response to mycobacterial infection.\n We found that glibenclamide significantly reduced M1 (HLA-DR+ and CD86+) surface markers and TNF-? production on primary human monocytes against mycobacterial infection.\n In contrast, M2 (CD163+ and CD206+) surface markers and IL-10 production were enhanced by pretreatment with glibenclamide.\n Additionally, reduction of bactericidal activity also occurred when primary human monocytes from T2DM individuals who were being treated with glibenclamide were infected with Mtb in vitro, consistent with the cytokine responses.\n We conclude that glibenclamide reduces M1 and promotes M2 polarization leading to impaired bactericidal ability of primary human monocytes of T2DM individuals in response to Mtb and may lead to increased susceptibility of T2DM individuals to TB

basis for defining metformin as a potential antiaging molecule.\n Moreover, emerging in vivo and in vitro evidence support the novel hypothesis that metformin can exhibit immune-modulatory features.\n Studies suggest that metformin interferes with key immunopathological mechanisms involved in systemic autoimmune diseases, such as the T helper 17/regulatory T cell balance, germinal centers formation, autoantibodies production, macrophage polarization, cytokine synthesis, neutrophil extracellular traps release, and bone or extracellular matrix remodeling.\n These effects may represent a powerful contributor to antiaging and anticancer properties exerted by metformin and, from another standpoint, may open the way to assess whether metformin can be a candidate molecule for clinical trials involving patients with immune-mediated diseases.\n In this article, we will review the available preclinical and clinical evidence regarding the effect of metformin on individual cells of the immune system, with emphasis on immunological mechanisms related to the development and maintenance of autoimmunity and its potential relevance in treatment of autoimmune diseases.\n","id":"PMC5994909","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Francesco","surname":"Ursini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emilio","surname":"Russo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gianluca","surname":"Pellino","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Salvatore","surname":"D’Angelo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Agostino","surname":"Chiaravalloti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giovambattista","surname":"De

We show that PI3K is activated by TLR stimulation in primary human pDCs and demonstrate, using specific inhibitors, that PI3K is required for type I IFN production by pDCs, both at the transcriptional

preferentially expressed the PI3K ? subunit, which was specifically involved in the control of type I IFN production.\n Although uptake and endosomal trafficking of TLR ligands were not affected in the presence of PI3K inhibitors, there was a dramatic defect in the nuclear translocation of IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7, whereas nuclear factor ?B activation was preserved.\n Thus, PI3K selectively

the immune response remain largely uncharacterized.\n To define the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in control of a model retroviral pathogen, Friend virus (FV), I generated mice in which the TLR signaling adapter Myd88 was selectively deleted in dendritic cell (DC) or in B cell lineages.\n Deletion of Myd88 in DCs had little effect on immune control of FV, while B cell specific deletion of Myd88 caused a dramatic increase in viral infectious centers and a significantly reduced antibody response, indicating that B cell-intrinsic TLR signaling plays a crucial role, while TLR signaling in DCs is less important.\n I then identified the single-stranded RNA sensing protein TLR7 as being required for antibody-mediated control of FV by analyzing mice deficient in TLR7. Remarkably, B cells in infected TLR7-deficient mice upregulated CD69 and CD86 early in infection, but failed to develop into germinal center B cells.\n CD4 T cell responses were also attenuated in the absence of TLR7, but CD8 responses were TLR7 independent, suggesting the existence of additional pathways for detection of retroviral particles.\n Together these results demonstrate that the vertebrate immune system detects retroviruses in vivo via TLR7 and that this pathway regulates a key checkpoint controlling development of germinal center B

A/H1N1pdm09 virus, which was subsequently included in the seasonal vaccine, up to 2016/2017, as the A/H1N1 strain.\n\n This provided a unique opportunity to investigate the antibody response to H1N1pdm09 over time.\n\n\nMethods\nHealthcare workers (HCWs) were immunized with the AS03-adjuvanted H1N1pdm09 vaccine in 2009 (N = 250), and subsequently vaccinated with seasonal vaccines containing H1N1pdm09 for 4 seasons (repeated group), &lt;4 seasons (occasional group), or no seasons (single group).\n\n Blood samples were collected pre and at 21 days and 3, 6, and 12 months after each vaccination, or annually (pre-season) from 2010 in the single group.\n\n The H1N1pdm09-specific antibodies were measured by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay.\n\n\nResults\nPandemic vaccination robustly induced HI antibodies that persisted above the 50% protective threshold (HI titers ? 40) over 12 months post-vaccination.\n\n Previous seasonal vaccination and the duration of adverse events after the pandemic vaccination influenced the decision to vaccinate in subsequent seasons.\n\n During 2010/2011–2013/2014, antibodies were boosted after each seasonal vaccination, although no significant difference was observed between the repeated and occasional groups.\n\n In the single group without seasonal vaccination, 32% of HCWs seroconverted (?4-fold increase in HI titers) during the 4 subsequent years, most of whom had HI titers &lt;40 prior to seroconversion.\n\n When excluding these seroconverted HCWs, HI titers gradually declined from 12 to 60 months

APOBEC3/Rfv3-dependent neutralizing antibody response but not innate retrovirus restriction","abstract":"Background\nAPOBEC3/Rfv3 restricts acute Friend retrovirus (FV) infection and promotes virus-specific neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses.\n\n Classical Rfv3 studies utilized FV stocks containing lactate-dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV), a potent type I interferon inducer.\n\n Previously, we showed that APOBEC3 is required for the anti-FV activity of exogenous IFN-alpha treatment.\n\n Thus, type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) signaling may be required for the APOBEC3/Rfv3 response.\n\n\nResults\nTo test if the APOBEC3/Rfv3 response is dependent on type I IFN signaling, we infected IFNAR knockout versus IFNAR/APOBEC3 double-knockout mice with FV/LDV or LDV-free FV, and evaluated acute FV infection and subsequent NAb titers.\n\n We show that LDV co-infection and type I IFN signaling are not required for innate APOBEC3-mediated restriction.\n\n By contrast, removal of LDV and/or type I IFN signaling abrogated the APOBEC3-dependent NAb response.\n\n\nConclusions\nAPOBEC3 can restrict retroviruses in a type I IFN-independent manner in vivo.\n\n By contrast, the ability of APOBEC3 to promote NAb responses is type I IFN-dependent.\n\n These findings reveal novel insights on the interplay between type I IFNs and APOBEC3 in vivo that may have implications for augmenting antiretroviral NAb responses.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12977-017-0349-2) contains supplementary material, which is available

pathogens that once emerged from other animal hosts.\n In addition to these established infections, new infectious diseases periodically emerge.\n In extreme cases they may cause pandemics such as

eukaryotes.\n These macroorganisms are exposed to and infected by a tremendous diversity of microorganisms.\n Those that are large enough can even be infected by multicellular fungi and parasites.\n Each interaction is unique, if only because it operates between two unique living organisms, in an infinite diversity of circumstances.\n This is neatly illustrated by the extraordinarily high level of interindividual clinical variability in human infections, even for a given pathogen, ranging from a total absence of clinical manifestations to death.\n We discuss here the idea that the determinism of human life-threatening infectious diseases can be governed by single-gene inborn errors of immunity, which are rarely Mendelian and frequently display incomplete penetrance.\n We briefly review the evidence in support of this notion obtained over the last two decades, referring to a number of focused and thorough reviews published by eminent colleagues in this issue of Human Genetics.\n It seems that almost any life-threatening infectious disease can be driven by at least one, and, perhaps, a great many diverse monogenic inborn errors, which may nonetheless be immunologically related.\n While the proportions of monogenic cases remain unknown, a picture in which genetic heterogeneity is combined with physiological homogeneity is emerging from these studies.\n A preliminary sketch of the human genetic architecture of severe infectious diseases is perhaps in sight.\n","id":"PMC7251220","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jean-Laurent","surname":"Casanova","email":"casanova@rockefeller.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laurent","surname":"Abel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.016","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

genetics of life-threatening influenza pneumonitis","abstract":"id='Par1'>Influenza viruses infect millions of people around the globe annually, usually causing self-limited upper respiratory tract infections.\n However, a small but non-negligible proportion of patients suffer from life-threatening pulmonary disease.\n Those affected include otherwise healthy individuals, and children with primary infections in particular.\n Much effort has been devoted to virological studies of influenza and vaccine development.\n By contrast, the enormous interindividual variability in susceptibility to influenza has received very little attention.\n One interesting hypothesis is that interindividual variability is driven largely by the genetic makeup of the infected patients.\n Unbiased genomic approaches have been used to search for genetic lesions in children with life-threatening pulmonary influenza.\n Four monogenic causes of severe influenza pneumonitis—deficiencies of GATA2, IRF7, IRF9, and TLR3—have provided evidence that severe influenza pneumonitis can be genetic and often in patients with no other severe infections.\n These deficiencies highlight the importance of human type I and III IFN-mediated immunity for host defense against influenza.\n Clinical penetrance is incomplete, and the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood.\n However, human genetic studies have clearly revealed that seemingly sporadic and isolated life-threatening influenza pneumonitis in otherwise healthy individuals can be

studies.\n The application of next-generation sequencing continues to expedite the rapid identification of novel gene defects, rare or common; broaden the immunological and clinical phenotypes of conditions arising from known gene defects and even known variants; and implement gene-specific therapies.\n These advances are contributing to greater understanding of the molecular, cellular, and immunological mechanisms of disease, thereby enhancing immunological knowledge while improving the management of patients and their families.\n This report serves as a valuable resource for the molecular diagnosis of individuals with heritable immunological disorders and also for the scientific dissection of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying inborn errors of immunity and related human diseases.\n","id":"PMC7082301","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stuart

interferon activity and inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients","abstract":"Interferons (IFNs) are central to antiviral immunity.\n Viral recognition elicits IFN production, which in turn triggers the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which engage in various antiviral functions.\n Type I IFNs (IFN-? and IFN-?) are widely expressed and can result in immunopathology during viral infections.\n By contrast, type III IFN (IFN-?) responses are primarily restricted to mucosal surfaces and are thought to confer antiviral protection without driving damaging proinflammatory responses.\n Accordingly, IFN-? has been proposed as a therapeutic in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other such viral respiratory diseases (see the Perspective by Grajales-Reyes and Colonna).\n Broggi et al.\n report that COVID-19 patient morbidity correlates with the high expression of type I and III IFNs in the lung.\n Furthermore, IFN-? secreted by dendritic cells in the lungs of mice exposed to synthetic viral RNA causes damage to the lung epithelium, which increases susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections.\n Similarly, using a mouse model of influenza infection, Major et al.\n found that IFN signaling (especially IFN-?) hampers lung repair by inducing p53 and inhibiting epithelial proliferation and differentiation.\n Complicating this picture, Hadjadj et al.\n observed that peripheral blood immune cells from severe and critical COVID-19 patients have diminished type I IFN and enhanced proinflammatory interleukin-6– and tumor necrosis factor-?–fueled responses.\n This suggests that in contrast to local production, systemic production of IFNs may be beneficial.\n The results of this trio of studies suggest that the location, timing, and duration of IFN exposure are critical parameters underlying the success or failure of therapeutics for viral respiratory

indeed a common procedure, in order to increase the power to detect genetic associations, this problem is important.\n We studied through simulation the impact of a fine scale population structure on

is the etiological agent of Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL) and of HTLV-1-Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP), whereas HTLV-2 does not cause hematological disorders and is only sporadically associated with cases of subacute myelopathy.\n Both HTLV genomes encode two regulatory proteins that play a pivotal role in pathogenesis: the transactivating Tax-1 and Tax-2 proteins and the antisense proteins HBZ and APH-2, respectively.\n We recently reported that Tax-1 and Tax-2 form complexes with the TNF-receptor associated factor 3, TRAF3, a negative regulator of the non-canonical NF-?B pathway.\n The NF-?B pathway is constitutively activated by the Tax proteins, whereas it is inhibited by HBZ and APH-2. The antagonistic effects of Tax and antisense proteins on NF-?B activation have not yet been fully clarified.\n Here, we investigated the effect of TRAF3 interaction with HTLV regulatory proteins and in particular its consequence on the subcellular distribution of the effector p65/RelA protein.\n We demonstrated that Tax-1 and Tax-2 efficiency on NF-?B activation is impaired in TRAF3 deficient cells obtained by CRISPR/Cas9 editing.\n We also found that APH-2 is more effective than HBZ in preventing Tax-dependent NF-?B activation.\n We further observed that TRAF3 co-localizes with Tax-2 and APH-2 in cytoplasmic complexes together with NF-?B essential modulator NEMO and TAB2, differently from HBZ and TRAF3. These results contribute to untangle the mechanism of NF-?B inhibition by HBZ and APH-2, highlighting the different role of the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 regulatory proteins in the NF-?B activation.\n","id":"PMC6581700","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stefania","surname":"Fochi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elisa","surname":"Bergamo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michela","surname":"Serena","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simona","surname":"Mutascio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chloé","surname":"Journo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Renaud","surname":"Mahieux","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincenzo","surname":"Ciminale","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Umberto","surname":"Bertazzoni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Donato","surname":"Zipeto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maria Grazia","surname":"Romanelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41586-020-2456-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Convergent Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2 in Convalescent Individuals","abstract":"id='P3'>During the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infected millions of people and claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.\n Virus entry into cells depends on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S).\n Although there is no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection.\n However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-21–5.\n Here we report on 149 COVID-19 convalescent individuals.\n Plasmas collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal pseudovirus neutralizing titers: less than 1:50 in 33% and below 1:1000 in 79%, while only 1% showed titers &gt;1:5000.

but a Broad Recall Response in Adults","abstract":"It is known since Thomas Francis, Jr.\n published his first paper on original antigenic sin in 1960 that the first infection(s) with influenza virus leaves a special immunological imprint which shapes immune responses to future infections with antigenically related influenza virus strains.\n Imprinting has been implicated in both protective effects as well as blunting of the immune response to vaccines.\n Despite the fact that this phenomenon was already described almost 60?years ago, we have very little detailed knowledge of the characteristics and breadth of the immune response to the first exposure(s) to influenza virus in life and how this compares to later exposure as adults.\n Here, we investigate these immune responses in detail using an influenza virus protein microarray.\n While our findings are mostly descriptive in nature and based on a small sample size, they provide a strong basis for future large-scale studies to better understand imprinting effects.\n","id":"PMC6974575","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Philip","surname":"Meade","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guillermina","surname":"Kuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shirin","surname":"Strohmeier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hannah

against type I IFNs in patients with life-threatening COVID-19","abstract":"The immune system is complex and involves many genes, including those that encode cytokines known as interferons (IFNs).\n Individuals that lack specific IFNs can be more susceptible to infectious diseases.\n Furthermore, the autoantibody system dampens IFN response to prevent damage from pathogen-induced inflammation.\n Two studies now examine the likelihood that genetics affects the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through components of this system (see the Perspective by Beck and Aksentijevich).\n Q.\n Zhang et al.\n used a candidate gene approach and identified patients with severe COVID-19 who have mutations in genes involved in the regulation of type I and III IFN immunity.\n They found enrichment of these genes in patients and conclude that genetics may determine the clinical course of the infection.\n Bastard et al.\n identified individuals with high titers of neutralizing autoantibodies against type I IFN-?2 and IFN-? in about 10% of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.\n These autoantibodies were not found either in infected people who were asymptomatic or had milder phenotype or in healthy individuals.\n Together, these studies identify a means by which individuals at highest risk of life-threatening COVID-19 can be identified.\n","id":"PMC7857397","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Bastard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lindsey

and infected by a tremendous diversity of microorganisms.\n Those that are large enough can even be infected by multicellular fungi and parasites.\n Each interaction is unique, if only because it operates between two unique living organisms, in an infinite diversity of circumstances.\n This is neatly illustrated by the extraordinarily high level of interindividual clinical variability in human infections, even for a given pathogen, ranging from a total absence of clinical manifestations to death.\n We discuss here the idea that the determinism of human life-threatening infectious diseases can be governed by single-gene inborn errors of immunity, which are rarely Mendelian and frequently display incomplete penetrance.\n We briefly review the evidence in support of this notion obtained over the last two decades, referring to a number of focused and thorough reviews published by eminent colleagues in this issue of Human Genetics.\n It seems that almost any life-threatening infectious disease can be driven by at least one, and, perhaps, a great many diverse monogenic inborn errors, which may nonetheless be immunologically related.\n While the proportions of monogenic cases remain unknown, a picture in which genetic heterogeneity is combined with physiological homogeneity is emerging from these studies.\n A preliminary sketch of the human genetic architecture of severe infectious diseases is perhaps in sight.\n","id":"PMC7251220","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jean-Laurent","surname":"Casanova","email":"casanova@rockefeller.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laurent","surname":"Abel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1086/380453","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Autoantibodies

cell immunodeficiencies.\n Specifically, the proinflammatory IL-17A–producing Th17 subset is implicated in protection against fungi at epithelial surfaces.\n In autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED, or autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome 1), CMC is often the first sign, but the underlying immunodeficiency is a long-standing puzzle.\n In contrast, the subsequent endocrine features are clearly autoimmune, resulting from defects in thymic self-tolerance induction caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE).\n We report severely reduced IL-17F and IL-22 responses to both Candida albicans antigens and polyclonal stimulation in APECED patients with CMC.\n Surprisingly, these reductions are strongly associated with neutralizing autoantibodies to IL-17F and IL-22, whereas responses were normal and autoantibodies infrequent in APECED patients without CMC.\n Our multicenter survey revealed neutralizing autoantibodies against IL-17A (41%), IL-17F (75%), and/ or IL-22 (91%) in &gt;150 APECED patients, especially those with CMC.\n We independently found autoantibodies against these Th17-produced cytokines in rare thymoma

type I interferon activity and inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients","abstract":"Interferons (IFNs) are central to antiviral immunity.\n Viral recognition elicits IFN production, which in turn triggers the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which engage in various antiviral functions.\n Type I IFNs (IFN-? and IFN-?) are widely expressed and can result in immunopathology during viral infections.\n By contrast, type III IFN (IFN-?) responses are primarily restricted to mucosal surfaces and are thought to confer antiviral protection without driving damaging proinflammatory responses.\n Accordingly, IFN-? has been proposed as a therapeutic in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other such viral respiratory diseases (see the Perspective by Grajales-Reyes and Colonna).\n Broggi et al.\n report that COVID-19 patient morbidity correlates with the high expression of type I and III IFNs in the lung.\n Furthermore, IFN-? secreted by dendritic cells in the lungs of mice exposed to synthetic viral RNA causes damage to the lung epithelium, which increases susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections.\n Similarly, using a mouse model of influenza infection, Major et al.\n found that IFN signaling (especially IFN-?) hampers lung repair by inducing p53 and inhibiting epithelial proliferation and differentiation.\n Complicating this picture, Hadjadj et al.\n observed that peripheral blood immune cells from severe and critical COVID-19 patients have diminished type I IFN and enhanced proinflammatory interleukin-6– and tumor necrosis factor-?–fueled responses.\n This suggests that in contrast to local production, systemic production of IFNs may be beneficial.\n The results of this trio of studies suggest that the

of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is associated with respiratory-related disease and death.\n\n Assays to detect virus-specific antibodies are important to understand the prevalence of infection and the course of the immune response.\n\n\nMethods\nQuantitative measurements of plasma or serum antibodies to the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were analyzed using luciferase immunoprecipitation system assays in 100 cross-sectional or longitudinal samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n A subset of samples was tested both with and without heat inactivation.\n\n\nResults\nAt &gt;14 days after symptom onset, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, whereas antibodies to spike protein were detected with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity.\n\n Neither antibody levels nor the rate of seropositivity were significantly reduced by heat inactivation of samples.\n\n Analysis of daily samples from 6 patients with COVID-19

various attributes.\n\n For example, in studies concerned with organismal relationships, tree nodes are associated with taxonomic names, whereas tree branches have lengths and oftentimes support values.\n\n Gene trees used in comparative genomics or phylogenomics are usually annotated with taxonomic information, genome-related data, such as gene names and functional annotations, as well as events such as gene duplications, speciations, or exon shufflings, combined with information related to the evolutionary tree itself.\n\n The data standards currently used for evolutionary trees have limited capacities to incorporate such annotations of different data types.\n\n\nResults\nWe developed a XML language, named phyloXML, for describing evolutionary trees, as well as various associated

has grown exponentially.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify the symptoms, comorbidities present, radiological features and outcomes for adults testing positive for COVID?19 admitted to hospital.\n\n The results across multiple studies were numerically pooled to yield total estimated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 45 studies were included in this review with 14 358 adult participants (average age 51 years, male 51%).\n\n The pooled findings suggest that the most common symptom among patients was fever (81.2%) followed by cough (62.9%), fatigue (38.0%) and anorexia/loss of appetite (33.7%).\n\n The comorbidities that were most prevalent among patients with the virus were hypertension (19.1%), cardiovascular disease (17.9%), endocrine disorder (9.3%) and diabetes (9.2%).\n\n Abnormal chest X?ray findings were present in 27.7% of patients and ground?glass opacity was demonstrated on chest computerized tomography in 63.0% of patients.\n\n The most frequent adverse outcomes were acute respiratory distress syndrome (27.4%), acute cardiac injury (16.2%) and acute kidney injury (12.6%).\n\n Death occurred in 8.2% of patients and 16.3% required intensive care admission and 11.7% had mechanical ventilation.\n\n Bacterial or secondary infections affected 8.5% of patients and 6.9% developed shock.\n\n\nConclusions\nCOVID?19 most commonly presents with fever, cough, fatigue and anorexia and among patients with existing hypertension and cardiovascular disease.\n\n It is important as serious adverse outcomes can develop such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury and death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7536970","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sadie","surname":"Bennett","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jacopo","surname":"Tafuro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Mayer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Darlington","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chun

b) a higher epidemiological exposure to viral respiratory infections associated with more frequent exposure to them, due to geographic and climatic conditions; c) less spread of the virus by location in the tropical zone; and d) earlier preventive measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Therefore, it is possible to establish that the situation in this country will be different from in European Mediterranean and that Colombia could have different endpoints from Spain and Italy.\n","id":"PMC7118674","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pedro","surname":"Amariles","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Johan","surname":"Granados","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mauricio","surname":"Ceballos","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carlos Julio","surname":"Montoya","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jhep.2020/04/010","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Multicentre analysis of clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 who develop liver injury","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19: a review of current literature","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a single arm meta-analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in China: a systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Efficacy of topical treatments for cutaneous warts: a meta-analysis and pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/all.14309","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 in a designated infectious disease hospital outside Hubei Province, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1093/cid/ciaa243","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Features and Short-term Outcomes of 102 Patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Objective\nIn December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China.\n\n In this study, we investigate clinical and laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19).\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 3 and February 1, 2020 were included.\n\n All those patients were with laboratory-confirmed infection.\n\n Epidemiological, clinical, radiological characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory tests treatment, complications and outcomes data were collected.\n\n Outcomes were followed up at discharge until Feb 15, 2020.\nResults\nThe study cohort included 102 adult patients.\n\n The median (IQR) age was 54 years (37-67years) and 48.0% were female.\n\n A total of 34 patients (33.3%) were exposed to source of transmission in the hospital setting (as health care workers, patients, or visitors) and 10 patients (9.8%) had a familial cluster.\n\n Eighteen patients (17.6%) were admitted to the ICU, and 17 patients died (mortality, 16.7%;

the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1st to February 5th.\n\n The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P&lt;0.05).\n\n Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P&lt;0.05).\n\n After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P&lt;0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.\n\n\nConclusion\nNearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization.\n\n The patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184444","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pingzheng","surname":"Mo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuanyuan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liping","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qiu","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongling","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shicheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mingqi","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tielong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shihui","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiying","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qian","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wang","email":"fanndywang@foxmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongxi","surname":"Zhang","email":"znact1936@126.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January 10 to February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed.\n\n The data of laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection.\n\n The median age was 58 years and 235 were male.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia.\n\n Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.\n\n Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines.\n\n The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases.\n\n Both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, and lower level of helper T cells in severe group.\n\n The percentage of naïve helper T cells increased and memory helper T cells decreased in severe

Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus.\n\n In total, 6% of the population was screened.\n\n Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study.\n\n Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted

The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males.\n\n The proportion of infected persons identified through population

of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors and risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital: a case-population study","abstract":"Background\nConcerns have been raised about the possibility that inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) could predispose individuals to severe COVID-19; however, epidemiological evidence is lacking.\n\n We report the results of a case-population study done in Madrid, Spain, since the outbreak of COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn this case-population study, we consecutively selected patients aged 18 years or older with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital from seven hospitals in Madrid, who had been admitted between March 1 and March 24, 2020. As a reference group, we randomly sampled ten patients per case, individually matched for age, sex, region (ie, Madrid), and date of admission to hospital (month and day; index date), from Base de datos para la Investigación Farmacoepidemiológica en Atención Primaria (BIFAP), a Spanish primary health-care database, in its last available year (2018).\n\n We extracted information on comorbidities and prescriptions up to the month before index date (ie, current use) from electronic clinical records of both cases and controls.\n\n The outcome of interest was admission to hospital of patients with COVID-19. To minimise confounding by indication, the main analysis focused on assessing the association between COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital and use of RAAS inhibitors compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs.\n\n We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, using conditional logistic regression.\n\n The protocol of the study was registered in the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies, EUPAS34437.\nFindings\nWe collected data for 1139 cases and 11?390 population controls.\n\n Among cases, 444 (39·0%) were female and the mean age was 69·1 years (SD 15·4), and despite being matched on sex and age, a significantly higher proportion of cases had pre-existing cardiovascular disease (OR 1·98, 95% CI 1·62–2·41) and risk factors (1·46, 1·23–1·73) than did controls.\n\n Compared with users of other antihypertensive drugs, users of RAAS inhibitors had an adjusted OR for COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital of 0·94 (95% CI 0·77–1·15).\n\n No increased risk was observed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·80, 0·64–1·00) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (1·10, 0·88–1·37).\n\n Sex, age, and background cardiovascular risk did not modify the adjusted OR between use of RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, whereas a decreased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital was found among patients with diabetes who were users of RAAS inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·53, 95% CI 0·34–0·80).\n\n The adjusted ORs were similar across severity degrees of COVID-19.\nInterpretation\nRAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, including fatal cases and those admitted to intensive care units, and should not be discontinued to prevent a severe case of COVID-19.\nFunding\nInstituto de Salud Carlos

into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness.\n Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions.\n Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak.\n Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species.\n We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that

the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7206933","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Mancia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Federico","surname":"Rea","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Monica","surname":"Ludergnani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Monica","surname":"Ludergnani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giovanni","surname":"Apolone","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giovanni","surname":"Corrao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2008975","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone

Hospital.\n\n The hospital was dedicated solely to the treatment of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.\n\n Hypertension and the treatments were stratified according to the medical history or medications administrated prior to the infection.\n\n Among 2877 hospitalized patients, 29.5% (850/2877) had a history of hypertension.\n\n After adjustment for confounders, patients with hypertension had a two-fold increase in the relative risk of mortality as compared with patients without hypertension [4.0% vs.\n\n 1.1%, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17–3.82, P =

not been typically assessed in these studies yet, although mechanistically and plausibly both, benefit and harm is possible with these agents, given that COVID-19 expresses to tissues through the

East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Virus Entry and Syncytia Formation","abstract":"Little is known about the biology of the emerging human group c betacoronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Because coronavirus spike glycoproteins (S) mediate virus entry, affect viral host range, and elicit neutralizing antibodies, analyzing the functions of MERS-CoV S protein is a high research priority.\n MERS-CoV S on lentivirus pseudovirions mediated entry into a variety of cell types including embryo cells from New World Eptesicus fuscus bats.\n Surprisingly, a polyclonal antibody to the S protein of MHV, a group a murine betacoronavirus, cross-reacted in immunoblots with the S2 domain of group c MERS-CoV spike protein.\n MERS pseudovirions released from 293T cells contained only uncleaved S, and pseudovirus entry was blocked by lysosomotropic reagents NH4Cl and bafilomycin and inhibitors of cathepsin L.\n However, when MERS pseudovirions with uncleaved S protein were adsorbed at 4°C to Vero E6 cells, brief trypsin treatment at neutral pH triggered virus entry at the plasma membrane and syncytia formation.\n When 293T cells producing MERS pseudotypes co-expressed serine proteases TMPRSS-2 or -4, large syncytia formed at neutral pH, and the pseudovirions produced were non-infectious and deficient in S protein.\n These experiments show that if S protein on MERS pseudovirions is uncleaved, then viruses enter by endocytosis in a cathepsin L-dependent manner, but if MERS-CoV S is cleaved, either during virus maturation by serine proteases or on pseudovirions by trypsin in extracellular fluids, then viruses enter at the plasma membrane at neutral pH and cause massive syncytia formation even in cells that express little or no MERS-CoV receptor.\n Thus, whether MERS-CoV enters cells within endosomes or at the plasma membrane depends upon the host cell type and tissue, and is determined by the location of host proteases that cleave the viral spike glycoprotein and activate membrane fusion.\n","id":"PMC3789674","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhaohui","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samuel

diffuse alveolar damage with severe capillary congestion and variegated findings in lungs and other organs suggesting vascular dysfunction","abstract":"Aims\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2), has rapidly evolved into a sweeping pandemic.\n\n Its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, and the general extent of organ involvement and the microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised.\n\n Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID?19?associated organ alterations.\n\n\nMethods and results\nThis article reports the autopsy findings of 21 COVID?19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland.\n\n An in?corpore technique was performed to ensure optimal staff safety.\n\n The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage and massive capillary congestion, often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation.\n\n Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia.\n\n Further findings included pulmonary embolism (n = 4), alveolar haemorrhage (n = 3), and vasculitis (n = 1).\n\n Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised and five of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\n Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy.\n\n Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus).\n\n Additionally, there was an overall predominance of males and individuals with blood group A (81% and 65%, respectively).\n\n All relevant histological slides are linked as open?source scans in supplementary files.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study provides an overview of postmortem findings in COVID?19 cases, implying that hypertensive, elderly, obese, male individuals with severe cardiovascular comorbidities as well as those with blood group A may have a lower threshold of tolerance for COVID?19. This provides a pathophysiological explanation for higher mortality rates among these patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7496150","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Menter","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jasmin

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cmi.2020.07.049","date":"2020-07-16","title":"Clinical

in northern Italy, included hospitalized adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between 25 February 2020 and 25 March 2020.\nResults\nOverall, 317 individuals were enrolled.\n\n Their median age was 71 years and 67.2% were male (213/317).\n\n The most common underlying diseases were hypertension (149/317; 47.0%), cardiovascular disease (63/317; 19.9%) and diabetes (49/317; 15.5%).\n\n Common symptoms at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis included fever (285/317; 89.9%), shortness of breath (167/317; 52.7%) and dry cough (156/317; 49.2%).\n\n An ‘atypical’ presentation including at least one

analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK

obesity are highly prevalent among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but little is known about their contributions to early COVID-19 outcomes.\n\n We tested the hypothesis that diabetes is a risk factor for poor early outcomes, after adjustment for obesity, among a cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe used data from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) COVID-19 Data Registry of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between 11 March 2020 and 30 April 2020. Primary outcomes were admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, and death within 14 days of presentation to care.\n\n Logistic regression models were adjusted for demographic characteristics, obesity, and relevant comorbidities.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 450 patients, 178 (39.6%) had diabetes—mostly type 2 diabetes.\n\n Among patients with diabetes versus patients without diabetes, a higher proportion was admitted to the ICU (42.1% vs.\n\n 29.8%, respectively, P = 0.007), required mechanical ventilation (37.1% vs.\n\n 23.2%, P = 0.001), and died (15.9% vs.\n\n 7.9%, P = 0.009).\n\n In multivariable logistic regression models, diabetes was associated with greater odds of ICU admission (odds ratio 1.59 [95% CI 1.01–2.52]), mechanical ventilation (1.97 [1.21–3.20]), and death (2.02 [1.01–4.03]) at 14 days.\n\n Obesity was associated with greater odds of ICU admission (2.16 [1.20–3.88]) and mechanical ventilation (2.13 [1.14–4.00]) but not with death.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong hospitalized patients with COVID-19, diabetes was associated with poor early outcomes, after adjustment for obesity.\n\n These findings can help inform patient-centered care decision making for people with diabetes at risk for COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7770271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jacqueline","surname":"Seiglie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jesse","surname":"Platt","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jesse","surname":"Platt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sara Jane","surname":"Cromer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bridget","surname":"Bunda","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Bridget","surname":"Bunda","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrea S.","surname":"Foulkes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ingrid V.","surname":"Bassett","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Hsu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James B.","surname":"Meigs","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aaron","surname":"Leong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Melissa S.","surname":"Putman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Virginia A.","surname":"Triant","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Deborah J.","surname":"Wexler","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jennifer","surname":"Manne-Goehler","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Diabetes in COVID-19: prevalence, pathophysiology, prognosis and practical considerations","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prevalence of comorbidities and its effects in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Factors associated with hospital admission and critical illness among 5279 people with coronavirus disease 2019 in New York City: prospective cohort study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk factors of critical &amp;

independent effects of diabetes status, by type, on in-hospital death in England in patients with COVID-19 during the period from March 1 to May 11, 2020.\nMethods\nWe did a whole-population study assessing risks of in-hospital death with COVID-19 between March 1 and May 11, 2020. We included all individuals registered with a general practice in England who were alive on Feb 16, 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the effect of diabetes status, by type, on in-hospital death with COVID-19, adjusting for demographic factors and cardiovascular comorbidities.\n\n Because of the absence of data on total numbers of people infected with COVID-19 during the observation period, we calculated mortality rates for the population as a whole, rather than the population who were infected.\n\n\nFindings\nOf the 61?414?470 individuals who were alive and registered with a general practice on Feb 16, 2020, 263?830 (0·4%) had a recorded diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, 2?864?670 (4·7%) had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, 41?750 (0·1%) had other types of diabetes, and 58?244?220 (94·8%) had no diabetes.\n\n 23?698 in-hospital COVID-19-related deaths occurred during the study period.\n\n A third occurred in people with diabetes: 7434 (31·4%) in people with type 2 diabetes, 364 (1·5%) in those with type 1 diabetes, and 69 (0·3%) in people with other types of diabetes.\n\n Unadjusted mortality rates per 100?000 people over the 72-day period were 27 (95% CI 27–28) for those without diabetes, 138 (124–153) for those with type 1 diabetes, and 260 (254–265) for those with type 2 diabetes.\n\n Adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity, and geographical region, compared with people without diabetes, the odds ratios (ORs) for in-hospital COVID-19-related death were 3·51 (95% CI 3·16–3·90) in people with type 1 diabetes and 2·03 (1·97–2·09) in people with type 2 diabetes.\n\n These effects were attenuated to ORs of 2·86 (2·58–3·18) for type 1 diabetes and 1·80 (1·75–1·86) for type 2 diabetes when also adjusted for previous hospital admissions with coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or heart

The associations between risk factors (including sex, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, HbA1c, renal impairment [from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)], BMI, tobacco smoking status, and cardiovascular comorbidities) and COVID-19-related mortality (defined as International Classification of Diseases, version 10, code U07.1 or U07.2 as a primary or secondary cause of death) between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, were investigated by use of Cox proportional hazards models.\n\n\nFindings\nWeekly death registrations in the first 19 weeks of 2020 exceeded the corresponding 3-year weekly averages for 2017–19 by 672 (50·9%) in people with type 1 diabetes and 16?071 (64·3%) in people with type 2 diabetes.\n\n Between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, among 264?390 people with type 1 diabetes and 2?874?020 people with type 2 diabetes, 1604 people with type 1 diabetes and 36?291 people with type 2 diabetes died from all causes.\n\n Of these total deaths, 464 in people with type 1 diabetes and 10?525 in people with type 2 diabetes were defined as COVID-19 related, of which 289 (62·3%) and 5833 (55·4%), respectively, occurred in people with a history of cardiovascular disease or with renal impairment (eGFR &lt;60 mL/min per 1·73 m2).\n\n Male sex, older age, renal impairment, non-white ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and previous stroke and heart failure were associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\n Compared with people with an HbA1c of 48–53 mmol/mol (6·5–7·0%), people with an HbA1c of 86 mmol/mol (10·0%) or higher had increased COVID-19-related mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2·23 [95% CI 1·50–3·30, p&lt;0·0001] in type 1 diabetes and 1·61 [1·47–1·77, p&lt;0·0001] in type 2 diabetes).\n\n In addition, in people with type 2 diabetes, COVID-19-related mortality was significantly higher in those with an HbA1c of 59 mmol/mol (7·6%) or higher than in those with an HbA1c of 48–53 mmol/mol (HR 1·22 [95% CI 1·15–1·30, p&lt;0·0001] for 59–74 mmol/mol [7·6–8·9%] and 1·36 [1·24–1·50, p&lt;0·0001] for 75–85 mmol/mol [9·0–9·9%]).\n\n The association between BMI and COVID-19-related mortality was U-shaped: in type 1 diabetes, compared with a BMI of 25·0–29·9 kg/m2, a BMI of less than 20·0 kg/m2 had an HR of 2·45 (95% CI 1·60–3·75, p&lt;0·0001) and a BMI of 40·0 kg/m2 or higher had an HR of 2·33 (1·53–3·56, p&lt;0·0001); the corresponding HRs for type 2 diabetes were 2·33 (2·11–2·56, p&lt;0·0001) and 1·60 (1·47–1·75, p&lt;0·0001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nDeaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes rose sharply during the initial COVID-19 pandemic in England.\n\n Increased COVID-19-related mortality was associated not only with cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes but, independently, also with glycaemic control and BMI.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7426091","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Naomi","surname":"Holman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Knighton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Partha","surname":"Kar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jackie","surname":"O'Keefe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matt","surname":"Curley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andy","surname":"Weaver","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emma","surname":"Barron","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chirag","surname":"Bakhai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kamlesh","surname":"Khunti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas J","surname":"Wareham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Naveed","surname":"Sattar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bob","surname":"Young","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan","surname":"Valabhji","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Bridges to Health Segmentation Model: person-level clinical segmentation data model","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"English indices of deprivation 2019","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"NOMIS official labour market statistics.

therapies for the prevention of vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease","abstract":"Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) are living further into adulthood in high-resource countries.\n However, despite increased quantity of life, recurrent, acute painful episodes cause significant morbidity for affected individuals.\n These SCD-related painful episodes, also referred to as vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), have multifactorial causes, and they often occur as a result of multicellular aggregation and vascular adherence of red blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets, leading to recurrent and unpredictable occlusion of the microcirculation.\n In addition to severe pain, long-term complications of vaso-occlusion may include damage to muscle and/or bone, in addition to vital organs such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, and brain.\n Severe pain associated with VOCs also has a substantial detrimental impact on quality of life for individuals with SCD, and is associated with increased health care utilization, financial hardship, and impairments in education and vocation attainment.\n Previous treatments have targeted primarily SCD symptom management, or were broad nontargeted therapies, and include oral or parenteral hydration, analgesics (including opioids), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and various other types of nonpharmacologic pain management strategies to treat the pain associated with VOC.\n With increased understanding of the pathophysiology of VOCs, there are several new potential therapies that specifically target the pathologic process of vaso-occlusion.\n These new therapies may reduce cell adhesion and inflammation, leading to decreased incidence of VOCs and prevention of end-organ damage.\n In this review, we consider the benefits and limitations of current treatments to reduce the occurrence of VOCs in individuals with SCD and the potential impact of emerging treatments on future disease management.\n","id":"PMC7534097","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ifeyinwa","surname":"Osunkwo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Deepa","surname":"Manwani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julie","surname":"Kanter","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/2049463720920682","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Mechanisms

U.\n\nS.\n\n and 20–25 million people globally.\n\n Individuals with SCD experience recurrent episodes of severe and unpredictable pain that are caused by vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), a hallmark of the disease.\n\n VOCs are the primary cause of hospitalization in SCD, result in missed workdays and school days, and decrease quality of life (QoL).\n\n Although VOCs cause significant burden in the

of comorbid medical conditions; explore barriers to accessing healthcare and special educational services; and assess the associations between sickle cell disease (SCD) status and demographics/socioeconomic status (SES), and social determinants of health (SDoH) on comorbidities among children in the USA.\n\n\nDesign\nCross-sectional.\n\n\nSetting\nNHIS Sample Child Core questionnaire 2007–2018 data set.\n\n\nParticipants\n133 481 children; presence of SCD was determined by an affirmative response from the adult or guardian of the child.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nMultivariate logistic regression was used to compare the associations between SCD status, SES and SDoH for various medical conditions for all races and separately for black children at p&lt;0.05.\nResults\n133 481 children (mean age 8.5 years, SD: 0.02), 215 had SCD and ~82% (weighted) of the children with SCD are black.\n\n Children with SCD were more likely to suffer from comorbid conditions, that is, anaemia (adjusted OR: 27.1, p&lt;0.001).\n\n Furthermore, children with SCD had at least two or more emergency room (ER) visits (p&lt;0.001) and were more likely to have seen a doctor 1–15 times per year (p&lt;0.05) compared with children without SCD.\n\n Household income (p&lt;0.001) and maternal education were lower for children with SCD compared with children without SCD (52.4% vs 63.5% (p&lt;0.05)).\n\n SCD children with a maternal parent who has &lt; / &gt; High School degree were less likely to have no ER visits or 4–5 ER visits, and more likely to have 2–3 ER visits within 12 months.\n\n\nConclusion\nChildren with SCD experienced significant comorbid conditions and have high healthcare usage, with black children being disproportionately affected.\n\n Moreover, maternal education status and poverty level illustrates how impactful SES can be on healthcare seeking behaviour for the SCD population.\n\n SDoH have significant implications for managing

Northeastern region of the United States from November to December 2019. Discussion questions were developed to align with the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) implementation science framework, focusing on the domains of

Sickle Cell Disease: Psychosocial Predictors of Health Care Behaviors","abstract":"Study objective\nIndividuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD) often require urgent care; however, some patients hesitate to present to the emergency department (ED), which may increase the risk of serious clinical complications.\n\n Our study aims to examine psychosocial, clinical, and demographic factors associated with delaying ED care.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a cross-sectional study of 267 adults with SCD from the national INSIGHTS Study.\n\n The binary outcome variable asked whether, in the past 12 months, participants had delayed going to an ED when they thought they needed care.\n\n Logistic regression was performed with clinical, demographic, and psychosocial measures.\n\n\nResults\nApproximately 67% of the participants reported delaying ED care.\n\n Individuals who delayed care were more likely to have reported higher stigma experiences (odds ratio [OR]=1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 1.16), more frequent pain episodes (OR=1.15; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32), lower health care satisfaction (OR= 0.74; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.94), and more frequent ED visits (OR=6.07; 95% CI 1.18 to 31.19).\n\n Disease severity and demographics, including sex, age, and health insurance status, were not significantly associated with delay in care.\n\n\nConclusion\nPsychosocial factors, including disease stigma and previous negative health care experiences, are associated with delay of ED care in this SCD cohort.\n\n There is a need to further investigate the influence of psychosocial factors on the health care–seeking behaviors of SCD patients, as well as the downstream consequences of these behaviors on morbidity and mortality.\n\n The resulting knowledge can contribute to efforts to improve health care experiences and patient-provider relationships in the SCD community.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7486179","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Khadijah","surname":"Abdallah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ashley","surname":"Buscetta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kayla","surname":"Cooper","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julia","surname":"Byeon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Crouch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sabrina","surname":"Pink","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caterina","surname":"Minniti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vence

and other complications that lead to frequent emergency department (ED) visits.\n\n To improve outcomes, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) published recommendations for management of acute pain crisis.\n\n NHLBI also funded eight centers across the United States to participate in the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium.\n\n This six-year effort consists of two phases.\n\n Phase one involved conducting needs assessments of barriers and facilitators to SCD care.\n\n The aim of this study was to describe challenges and facilitators to caring for SCD from the perspective of ED providers in central North Carolina (NC).\n\n\nMethods and findings\nWe conducted a needs assessment survey with ED providers throughout NC.\n\n We also conducted focus groups and an interview with ED providers from three healthcare facilities in central NC.\n\n One hundred and eleven surveys (60.6% physicians, 26% registered nurses, 13.5% physician assistants) were completed and 13 providers participated in 3 focus groups and 1 interview.\n\n Slightly more than half (50. 4%) utilized individualized dosing protocols to treat sickle cell pain.\n\n Only 32.4% of the providers were aware of the NHLBI SCD recommendations.\n\n Barriers to care from the survey included: patient behavior (67.57%), the opioid epidemic (67.57%), overcrowding (64.86%), and concern about addiction (49.55%).\n\n Perceived barriers to care identified in the focus groups and interview included: high patient volumes, lack of SCD care protocols, poor communication among providers and stigma.\n\n Facilitators to care included: individualized pain plans, comfort prescribing opioids and electronic medical records.\n\n\nConclusion\nSCD care is influenced by many factors.\n\n Our results illuminate the need for increased use of the NHLBI SCD recommendations, individualized pain protocols, and use of electronic medical records and other care-interventions, specifically geared towards improving provider knowledge and mitigating provider bias.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6504169","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rita

(SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.\n\n We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in

When typical or indeterminate features of COVID-19 pneumonia are present in endemic areas as an incidental finding, we recommend contacting the referring providers to discuss the likelihood of viral infection.\n These incidental findings do not necessarily need to be reported as COVID-19 pneumonia.\n In this setting, using the term “viral pneumonia” can be a reasonable and inclusive alternative.\n However, if one opts to use the term “COVID-19” in the incidental setting, consider the provided standardized reporting language.\n In addition, practice patterns may vary, and this

evolved substantially, with the development of novel\nassays as well as the availability of updated tests for emerging ones.\n Newer laboratory\nmethods are fast, highly sensitive and specific, and are gradually replacing the\nconventional gold standards.\n This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods\navailable for testing coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus disease 2019

time, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx\nincreases.\n Several integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are\ncurrently under development for fast and

of patients with diabetes hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 11 March to 7 May 2020 at a large academic medical center in New York City.\n\n Multivariate modeling was used to assess the independent association of HbA1c levels and outpatient diabetes treatment regimen with mortality, in addition to independent effects of demographic and clinical characteristics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe included 1,126 hospitalized patients with diabetes and COVID-19 for analysis, among whom mean age was 68 years, 50% were male, 75% were Black, mean BMI was 30 kg/m2, 98% had type 2 diabetes, mean HbA1c was 7.5%, and 33.1% died.\n\n HbA1c levels were not associated with mortality in unadjusted or adjusted analyses, but an outpatient regimen with any insulin treatment was strongly

higher risk of severe pneumonia, release of tissue injury?related enzymes, excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism.\n\n Furthermore, serum levels of inflammation?related biomarkers such as IL?6, C?reactive protein, serum ferritin and coagulation index, D?dimer, were significantly higher (P &lt;?.\n\n01) in diabetic patients compared with those without, suggesting that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to an inflammatory storm eventually leading to rapid deterioration of COVID?19.\nConclusions\nOur data support the notion that diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID?19. More intensive attention should be paid to patients with diabetes, in case of rapid deterioration.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7228407","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Weina","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mingyue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yalan","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haifeng","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zili","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chunxia","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Renjie","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haijun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yin","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Keye","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heng","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shanshan","surname":"Luo","email":"shsh689@126.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Desheng","surname":"Hu","email":"desheng.hu@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Initiative pour la promotion de la qualite et l'epidemiologie du diabete sucre, IPQED, Audit 10, Donnees 2017 - 2018","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eng.2020.05.017","date":"2020-05-17","title":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Type 2 Diabetes Patients Infected with COVID-19: A Retrospective Study","abstract":"Diabetes and its related metabolic disorders have been reported as the leading comorbidities in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n This clinical study aims to investigate the clinical features, radiographic and laboratory tests, complications, treatments, and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes.\n This retrospective study included 208 hospitalized patients (? 45 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during the period between 12 January and 25 March 2020.

ratio [aHR] 1.23 [95% CI 1.14, 1.32]), and this result was consistent in HDU and ICU subsets.\n\n The relative mortality risk associated with type 2 diabetes decreased with higher age (age 18–49 years aHR 1.50 [95% CI 1.05, 2.15], age 50–64 years 1.29 [1.10, 1.51], and age ?65 years 1.18 [1.09, 1.29]; P value for age–type 2 diabetes interaction = 0.002).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nType 2 diabetes may be an independent prognostic factor for survival in people with severe COVID-19 requiring critical care treatment, and in this setting the risk increase associated with type 2 diabetes is greatest in younger people.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7783930","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"John M.","surname":"Dennis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bilal

modifiable risk factors, including hyperglycaemia and obesity, and COVID-19-related mortality among people with diabetes is unclear.\n\n We assessed associations between risk factors and COVID-19-related mortality in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a population-based cohort study of people with diagnosed diabetes who were registered with a general practice in England.\n\n National population data on people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes collated by the National Diabetes Audit were linked to mortality records collated by the Office for National Statistics from Jan 2, 2017, to May 11, 2020. We identified the weekly number of deaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the first 19 weeks of 2020 and calculated the percentage change from the mean number of deaths for the corresponding weeks in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The associations between risk factors (including sex, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, HbA1c, renal impairment [from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)], BMI, tobacco smoking status, and cardiovascular comorbidities) and COVID-19-related mortality (defined as International Classification of Diseases, version 10, code U07.1 or U07.2 as a primary or secondary cause of death) between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, were investigated by use of Cox proportional hazards models.\n\n\nFindings\nWeekly death registrations in the first 19 weeks of 2020 exceeded the corresponding 3-year weekly averages for 2017–19 by 672 (50·9%) in people with type 1 diabetes and 16?071 (64·3%) in people with type 2 diabetes.\n\n Between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, among 264?390 people with type 1 diabetes and 2?874?020 people with type 2 diabetes, 1604 people with type 1 diabetes and 36?291 people with type 2 diabetes died from all causes.\n\n Of these total deaths, 464 in people with type 1 diabetes and 10?525 in people with type 2 diabetes were defined as COVID-19 related, of which 289 (62·3%) and 5833 (55·4%), respectively, occurred in people with a history of cardiovascular disease or with renal impairment (eGFR &lt;60 mL/min per 1·73 m2).\n\n Male sex, older age, renal impairment, non-white ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and previous stroke and heart failure were associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\n Compared with people with an HbA1c of 48–53 mmol/mol (6·5–7·0%), people with an HbA1c of 86 mmol/mol (10·0%) or higher had increased COVID-19-related mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2·23 [95% CI 1·50–3·30, p&lt;0·0001] in type 1 diabetes and 1·61 [1·47–1·77, p&lt;0·0001] in type 2 diabetes).\n\n In addition, in people with type 2 diabetes, COVID-19-related mortality was significantly higher in those with an HbA1c of 59 mmol/mol (7·6%) or higher than in those with an HbA1c of 48–53 mmol/mol (HR 1·22 [95% CI 1·15–1·30, p&lt;0·0001] for 59–74 mmol/mol [7·6–8·9%] and 1·36 [1·24–1·50, p&lt;0·0001] for 75–85 mmol/mol [9·0–9·9%]).\n\n The association between BMI and COVID-19-related mortality was U-shaped: in type 1 diabetes, compared with a BMI of 25·0–29·9 kg/m2, a BMI of less than 20·0 kg/m2 had an HR of 2·45 (95% CI 1·60–3·75, p&lt;0·0001) and a BMI of 40·0 kg/m2 or higher had an HR of 2·33 (1·53–3·56, p&lt;0·0001); the corresponding HRs for type 2 diabetes were 2·33 (2·11–2·56, p&lt;0·0001) and 1·60 (1·47–1·75, p&lt;0·0001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nDeaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes rose sharply during the initial COVID-19 pandemic in England.\n\n Increased COVID-19-related mortality was associated not only with cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes but, independently, also with glycaemic control and BMI.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7426091","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Naomi","surname":"Holman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Knighton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Partha","surname":"Kar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jackie","surname":"O'Keefe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matt","surname":"Curley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andy","surname":"Weaver","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emma","surname":"Barron","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chirag","surname":"Bakhai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kamlesh","surname":"Khunti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas J","surname":"Wareham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Naveed","surname":"Sattar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bob","surname":"Young","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan","surname":"Valabhji","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S2213-8587(20)30272-2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Associations of type 1 and type 2 diabetes with COVID-19-related mortality in England: a whole-population study","abstract":"Background\nAlthough diabetes has been associated with COVID-19-related mortality, the absolute and relative risks for type 1 and type 2 diabetes are unknown.\n\n We assessed the independent effects of diabetes status, by type, on in-hospital death in England in patients with COVID-19 during the period from March 1 to May 11, 2020.\nMethods\nWe did a whole-population study assessing risks of in-hospital death with COVID-19 between March 1 and May 11, 2020.

obesity is associated with worse outcomes independently from age, gender and other comorbidities.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission.\n\n The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nResults\n200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102).\n\n The median BMI was 30?kg/m2.\n\n The median age was 64?years.\n\n Hypertension (76%), hyperlipidemia (46.2%), and diabetes (39.5%) were the three most common comorbidities.\n\n Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms.\n\n 24% died during hospitalization (BMI?&lt;?25?kg/m2: 31.6%, BMI 25–34?kg/m2: 17.2%,

age, male sex, BMI???35?kg/m2 and current or prior smoking were significant predictors for increasing oxygenation requirements in the multivariate analysis, while male sex, age and BMI???35?kg/m2 were significant predictors in the multivariate analysis for the outcome of intubation.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe

factors in patients with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19: Findings from the CORONADO study and other recent reports","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus is challenging in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients.\n As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection.\n This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly China and the US.\n Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance.\n Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits.\n While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, but whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown.\n In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified.\n Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection.\n Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.\n","id":"PMC7241378","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"A.J.","surname":"Scheen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Marre","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"C.","surname":"Thivolet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMsa2011686","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hospitalization

Emerging Threat of (Micro)Thrombosis in COVID-19 and Its Therapeutic Implications","abstract":"The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing global pandemic has presented a health emergency of unprecedented magnitude.\n Recent clinical data has highlighted that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a significant risk of thrombotic complications ranging from microvascular thrombosis, venous thromboembolic disease, and stroke.\n Importantly, thrombotic complications are markers of severe COVID-19 and are associated with multiorgan failure and increased mortality.\n The evidence to date supports the concept that the thrombotic manifestations of severe COVID-19 are due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to invade endothelial cells via ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which is expressed on the endothelial cell surface.\n However, in patients with COVID-19 the subsequent endothelial inflammation, complement activation, thrombin generation, platelet, and leukocyte recruitment, and the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses culminate in immunothrombosis, ultimately causing (micro)thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.\n Accordingly, the activation of coagulation (eg, as measured with plasma D-dimer) and thrombocytopenia have emerged as prognostic markers in COVID-19. Given thrombotic complications are central determinants of the high mortality rate in COVID-19, strategies to prevent thrombosis are of critical importance.\n Several antithrombotic drugs have been proposed as potential therapies to prevent COVID-19-associated thrombosis, including heparin, FXII inhibitors, fibrinolytic drugs, nafamostat, and dipyridamole, many of which also possess pleiotropic anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects.\n The growing awareness and mechanistic understanding of the prothrombotic state of COVID-19 patients are driving efforts to more stringent diagnostic screening for thrombotic complications and to the early institution of antithrombotic drugs, for both the prevention and therapy of thrombotic complications.\n The shifting paradigm of diagnostic and treatment strategies holds significant promise to reduce the burden of thrombotic complications and ultimately improve the prognosis for patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7386875","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"James D.","surname":"McFadyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hannah","surname":"Stevens","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Karlheinz","surname":"Peter","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1182/blood.2020006000","date":"2020-04-27","title":"COVID-19 and its implications for thrombosis and anticoagulation","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced infection can be associated with a coagulopathy, findings consistent with infection-induced inflammatory changes as observed in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).\n The lack of prior immunity to COVID-19 has resulted in large numbers of infected patients across the globe and uncertainty regarding management of the complications that arise in the course of this viral illness.\n The lungs are the target organ for COVID-19; patients develop acute lung injury that can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur.\n The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen-degradation products, whereas abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations.\n Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested.\n COVID-19–associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC.\n Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full-intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated.\n Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with COVID-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with DIC, have not been reported.\n If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of DIC and bleeding should be followed.\n","id":"PMC7273827","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jean M.","surname":"Connors","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jerrold H.","surname":"Levy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jvs.2020.05.015","date":"2020-05-05","title":"The need to manage the risk of thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients","abstract":"COVID-19 first appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019.

prior to admission (1.53 (1.37 to 1.72)).\n\n When stratified by the potential underlying diseases, the risk of DIC was higher in T2DM patients with non-septic severe infection (1.67 (1.41 to 1.97)) and with solid tumour (1.59 (1.47 to 1.72)) than in non-DM patients with those underlying diseases.\n\n The risk was similar between T2DM and non-DM patients with sepsis (0.98 (0.90 to 1.08)) and lower in T2DM patients with acute leukaemia (0.70 (0.59 to 0.84)).\n\n\nConclusions\nT2DM was associated with a higher risk of DIC, particularly when recently treated with insulin, as well as among admissions with solid tumour or non-septic severe infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5278301","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kenichiro","surname":"Nogami","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Isao","surname":"Muraki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hironori","surname":"Imano","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hiroyasu","surname":"Iso","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.stem.2020.06.015","date":"2020-06-15","title":"A

in people with diabetes: understanding the reasons for worse outcomes","abstract":"Since the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China, much attention has focused on people with diabetes because of poor prognosis in those with the infection.\n Initial reports were mainly on people with type 2 diabetes, although recent surveys have shown that individuals with type 1 diabetes are also at risk of severe COVID-19. The reason for worse prognosis in people with diabetes is likely to be multifactorial, thus reflecting the syndromic nature of diabetes.\n Age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease, obesity, and a pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulative state all probably contribute to the risk of worse outcomes.\n Glucose-lowering agents and anti-viral treatments can modulate the risk, but limitations to their use and potential interactions with COVID-19 treatments should be carefully assessed.\n Finally, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection itself might represent a worsening factor for people with diabetes, as it can precipitate acute metabolic complications through direct negative effects on ?-cell function.\n These effects on ?-cell function might also cause diabetic ketoacidosis in individuals with diabetes, hyperglycaemia at hospital admission in individuals with unknown history of diabetes, and potentially new-onset diabetes.\n","id":"PMC7367664","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matteo","surname":"Apicella","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maria Cristina","surname":"Campopiano","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michele","surname":"Mantuano","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Mazoni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alberto","surname":"Coppelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefano","surname":"Del Prato","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/dom.14057","date":"2020-04-15","title":"\n<styled-content style='fixed-case' toggle='no'>COVID</styled-content>?19 infection may cause ketosis and ketoacidosis","abstract":"The present study included 658 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID?19.

Tumor cells, as well as tumor-derived EVs, may activate and promote platelet aggregation by TF-dependent and independent pathways.\n Cancer cells and their secreted EVs may also facilitate the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which may contribute to thrombus development.\n Alternatively, the presence of polyphosphate (polyP) in tumor-derived EVs may promote thrombosis through a TF-independent route.\n We conclude that the contribution of EVs to cancer coagulopathy is quite complex, in which one or more mechanisms may take place in a certain cancer type.\n In this

Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19 in Africa: Early Insights from the Democratic Republic of the Congo","abstract":"Little is known about the clinical features and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Africa.\n We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 10, 2020 and July 31, 2020 at seven hospitals in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n Outcomes included clinical improvement within 30 days (primary) and in-hospital mortality (secondary).\n Of 766 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 500 (65.6%) were male, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 46 (34–58) years.\n One hundred ninety-one (25%) patients had severe/critical disease requiring admission in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n Six hundred twenty patients (80.9%) improved and were discharged within 30 days of admission.\n Overall in-hospital mortality was 13.2% (95% CI: 10.9–15.8), and almost 50% among those in the ICU.\n Independent risk factors for death were age &lt; 20 years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 6.62, 95% CI: 1.85–23.64), 40–59 years (aHR = 4.45, 95% CI: 1.83–10.79), and ? 60 years (aHR = 13.63, 95% CI: 5.70–32.60) compared with those aged 20–39 years, with obesity (aHR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.24–4.27), and with chronic kidney disease (aHR = 5.33, 95% CI: 1.85–15.35).\n In marginal structural model analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in odds of clinical improvement (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.53, 95% CI: 0.88–2.67, P = 0.132) nor risk of death (aOR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.35–1.20) when comparing the use of chloroquine/azithromycin versus other treatments.\n In this DRC study, the high mortality among patients aged &lt; 20 years and with severe/critical disease is of great concern, and requires further research for confirmation and targeted interventions.\n","id":"PMC7695108","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jean

(COVID-19) on the African continent resulted in a range of lockdown measures that curtailed the spread of the infection but caused economic hardship.\n African countries now face difficult choices regarding easing of lockdowns and sustaining effective public health control measures and surveillance.\n Pandemic control will require efficient community screening, testing, and contact tracing; behavioral change interventions; adequate resources; and well-supported, community-based teams of trained, protected personnel.\n We discuss COVID-19 control approaches in selected African countries and the need for shared, affordable, innovative methods to overcome challenges and minimize mortality.\n This crisis presents a unique opportunity to align COVID-19 services with those already in place for human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, malaria, and non communicable diseases through mobilization of Africa’s interprofessional healthcare workforce.\n By addressing the challenges, the detrimental effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on African citizens can be minimized.\n","id":"PMC7314180","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jean

evidence on the safety and efficacy of these therapies is limited.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label, three-group, controlled trial involving hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 who were receiving either no supplemental oxygen or a maximum of 4 liters per minute of supplemental oxygen.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive standard care, standard care plus hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg twice daily, or standard care plus hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg twice daily plus azithromycin at a dose of 500 mg once daily for 7 days.\n\n The primary outcome was clinical status at 15 days as assessed with the use of a seven-level ordinal scale (with levels ranging from one to seven and higher scores indicating a worse condition) in the modified intention-to-treat population (patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19).\n\n Safety was also assessed.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 667 patients underwent randomization; 504 patients had confirmed Covid-19 and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis.\n\n As compared with standard care, the proportional odds of having a higher score on the seven-point ordinal scale at 15 days was not affected by either hydroxychloroquine alone (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 2.11; P=1.00) or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.73; P=1.00).\n\n Prolongation of the corrected QT interval and elevation of liver-enzyme levels were more frequent in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, than in those who were not receiving either agent.\n\n\nConclusions\nAmong patients hospitalized with mild-to-moderate Covid-19, the use of hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, did not improve clinical status at 15 days as compared with standard care.\n\n (Funded by the Coalition Covid-19 Brazil and EMS Pharma;

Important changes include: 1) the decision to treat high-risk individuals with a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist or sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hospitalization for heart failure (hHF), cardiovascular death, or chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression should be considered independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target; 2) GLP-1 receptor agonists can also be considered in patients with type 2 diabetes without established cardiovascular disease (CVD) but with the presence of specific indicators of high risk; and 3) SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure, particularly those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, to reduce hHF, MACE, and CVD death, as well as in patients with type 2 diabetes with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 to ?60 mL min–1 [1.73 m]–2 or urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio &gt;30 mg/g,

65 Years of Age","abstract":"Quality of life is an important indicator of the treatment process, lifestyle, and influence of many other factors, both exogenous and endogenous, on the body.\n Determining the quality of life of healthy people (health-related quality of life (HRQoL), considering the influence of various factors, is important due to the possibility of making subsequent comparative analyses regarding the quality of life of people diagnosed with diseases.\n In addition, it allows us to identify the most crucial factors influencing the HRQoL in the process of “good aging”.\n The purpose of the study was to present the HRQoL level of healthy people over 65 years of age.\n HRQoL was measured in five-year age groups (66–70, 71–75, 76–80, &gt;80 years), considering the analyzed factors.\n Finally, 1038 healthy people were included in the study.\n The inclusion criteria were as follows: no diagnosed chronic diseases, no permanent treatment in specialist clinics, and no constant administration of medicaments.\n A comparative analysis was carried out, assuming a 5% conclusion error.\n The SF-36 questionnaire assessing the main dimensions of the quality of life was the tool used in the study to assess the HRQoL: the physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary (MCS) and index of life quality (ILQ).\n The factors significantly differentiating the average level of HRQoL were as follows: gender, place of residence, education, employment status, smoking and physical activity.\n Relationship status (p &gt; 0.05) was one of the analyzed factors that did not influence the differences in the average level of the perceived HRQoL.\n More than a twofold greater chance of a higher HRQoL was reported in the group of men under 75 years of age (66–70: OR = 2.01; 71–75: OR = 2.52) compared to the group of women.\n The same relationship was noted in the case of higher education in respondents up to the age of 80 (66–70: OR = 1.56; 71–75: OR = 2.16; 76–80: OR = 2.74).\n Smoking by people over 80 years of age significantly increased the chances of a higher HRQoL in each of the dimensions (PCS: OR = 4.09; MCS: OR = 12.64; ILQ: OR = 5.79).\n Age as a non-modifiable factor significantly differentiates the level of the HRQoL of healthy people over 65 years of age.\n The results of the conducted study on HRQoL can be helpful when comparing the HRQoL of healthy people with a group of people with chronic diseases.\n","id":"PMC8776108","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marlena","surname":"Krawczyk-Suszek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrzej","surname":"Kleinrok","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Andrzej","surname":"Kleinrok","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man-Kit","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Man-Kit","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41598-021-90611-x","date":"2021-05-11","title":"Development of comorbidities in type 2 diabetes between 2005 and 2017 using German claims data","abstract":"id='Par1'>Against the background of increasing life expectancy over time, several hypotheses have been proposed on the way morbidity has been developing.\n In type 2 diabetes (T2D), previous research suggests that morbidity compression could be ruled out due to increasing prevalence and life expectancy with T2D over time.\n Understanding how the health state in individuals with T2D is developing would help identify whether morbidity expansion or a dynamic equilibrium pattern applies for this disease.\n This study aims to answer the following questions: (1) How do the number and the prevalence of T2D concordant comorbidities develop over time? (2) What does this imply in terms of morbidity development in T2D in Germany? The study used claims data from a statutory health insurance provider in Lower Saxony, Germany.\n Period prevalence of T2D concordant comorbidities was examined for the periods 2005–2007, 2010–2012 and 2015–2017 in 240,241, 295,868 and 308,134 individuals with T2D respectively.\n The effect of time period on the number and prevalence of comorbidities was examined by means of (ordered) logistic regression.\n The age-adjusted predicted probabilities of more severe cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) decreased over the three periods while those of less severe CVDs and other vascular diseases increased significantly in men and women and among all examined age-groups.\n Predicted probability of having at least one more comorbidity over time also increased significantly among all examined groups.\n While less and more severe CVDs exhibited different developmental patterns, the results of the study point towards morbidity expansion in T2D.\n Future studies should focus on mechanisms that contribute to these trends.\n","id":"PMC8159920","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Batoul","surname":"Safieddine","email":"Safieddine.Batoul@mh-hannover.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefanie","surname":"Sperlich","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jelena","surname":"Epping","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Karin","surname":"Lange","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Siegfried","surname":"Geyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Assessing

significant impact on use of health care services, particularly hospitals, is a concern for health planners.\n\n This paper explores the risk factors for all-cause hospitalisation and the excess risk due to diabetes in a large sample of older Australians.\n\n\nMethods\nThe study population was 263,482 participants in the 45 and Up Study.\n\n The data assessed were linked records of hospital admissions in the 12 months following completion of a baseline questionnaire.\n\n All cause and ambulatory care sensitive admission rates and length of stay were examined.\n\n The associations between demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, and health and wellbeing and risk of hospitalisation were explored using zero inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression models adjusting for age and gender.\n\n The ratios of adjusted relative rates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine the excess risk due to diabetes.\n\n\nResults\nPrevalence of diabetes was 9.0% (n?=?23,779).\n\n Age adjusted admission rates for all-cause hospitalisation were 631.3 and 454.8 per 1,000 participant years and the mean length of stay was 8.2 and 7.1 days respectively for participants with and without diabetes.\n\n In people with and without diabetes, the risk of hospitalisation was associated with age, gender, household income, smoking, BMI, physical activity, and health and wellbeing.\n\n However, the increased risk of hospitalisation was attenuated for participants with diabetes who were older, obese, or had hypertension or hyperlipidaemia and enhanced for those participants with diabetes who were male, on low income, current smokers or who had anxiety or depression.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study is one of the few studies published to explore the impact of diabetes on hospitalisation in a large non-clinical population, the 45 and Up Study.\n\n The attenuation of risk associated with some factors is likely to be due to correlation between diabetes and factors such as age and obesity.\n\n The increased risk in association with other factors such as gender and low income in participants with diabetes is likely to be due to their synergistic influence on health status and the way services are accessed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4310177","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Elizabeth

Window of opportunity trial","abstract":"Objective\nThe tumor microenvironment frequently displays abnormal cellular metabolism, which contributes to aggressive behavior.\n\n Metformin inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, altering metabolism.\n\n Though the mechanism is unclear, epidemiologic studies show an association between metformin use and improved outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).\n\n We sought to determine if metformin alters metabolism and apoptosis in HNSCC tumors.\n\n\nStudy Design\nWindow of opportunity trial of metformin between diagnostic biopsy and resection.\n\n Participants were patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC.\n\n Fifty patients were enrolled, and 39 completed a full?treatment course.\n\n Metformin was titrated to standard diabetic dose (2,000 mg/day) for a course of 9 or more days prior to surgery.\n\n\nMethods\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) for the metabolic markers caveolin?1 (CAV1), B?galactosidase (GALB), and monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), as well as the Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) apoptosis assay and Ki?67 IHC, were performed in pre? and postmetformin specimens.\n\n Exploratory mass spectroscopy imaging (MSI) to assess lactate levels also was performed in three subjects.\n\n\nResults\nMetformin was well tolerated.\n\n The average treatment course was 13.6 days.\n\n Posttreatment specimens showed a significant increase in stromal CAV1 (P &lt; 0.001) and GALB (P &lt; 0.005), as well as tumor cell apoptosis by TUNEL assay (P &lt; 0.001).\n\n There was no significant change in stromal MCT4 expression or proliferation measured by Ki67. Lactate levels in carcinoma cells were increased 2.4?fold postmetformin (P &lt; 0.05), as measured by MSI.\n\n\nConclusion\nMetformin increases markers of reduced catabolism and increases senescence in stromal cells as well as carcinoma cell apoptosis.\n\n This study demonstrates that metformin modulates metabolism in the HNSCC microenvironment.\n\n\nLevel of Evidence\n4.

stroke and communicable neurological disorders were responsible for most of these decreases.\n\n Communicable neurological disorders were the largest cause of DALYs in countries with low SDI.\n\n Stroke rates were highest at middle levels of SDI and lowest at the highest SDI.\n\n Most of the changes in DALY rates of neurological disorders with development were driven by changes in YLLs.\n\n\nInterpretation\nNeurological disorders are an important cause of disability and death worldwide.\n\n Globally, the burden of neurological disorders has increased substantially over the past 25 years because of expanding population numbers and ageing, despite substantial decreases in mortality rates from stroke and communicable neurological disorders.\n\n The number of patients who will need care by clinicians with expertise in neurological conditions will continue to grow in coming decades.\n\n Policy makers and health-care providers should be aware of these trends to provide adequate services.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp;

agent, stands out not only for its antihyperglycemic properties but also for its effects beyond glycemic control such as improvements in endothelial dysfunction, hemostasis and oxidative stress, insulin resistance, lipid profiles, and fat redistribution.\n These properties may have contributed to the decrease of adverse cardiovascular outcomes otherwise not attributable to metformin’s mere antihyperglycemic effects.\n Several other classes of oral antidiabetic agents have been recently launched, introducing the need to evaluate the role of metformin as initial therapy and in combination with these newer drugs.\n There is increasing evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies supporting its anti-proliferative role in cancer and possibly a neuroprotective effect.\n Metformin’s negligible risk of hypoglycemia in monotherapy and few drug interactions of clinical relevance give this drug a high safety profile.\n The tolerability of metformin may be improved by using an appropiate dose titration, starting with low doses, so that side-effects can be minimized or by switching to an extended release form.\n We reviewed the role of metformin in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and describe the additional benefits beyond its glycemic effect.\n We also discuss its potential role for a variety of insulin resistant and pre-diabetic states, obesity,

pathways in disease risk","abstract":"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a highly heritable complex disease with no current effective prevention or treatment.\n The majority of drugs developed for AD focus on the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which implicates Aß plaques as a causal factor in the disease.\n However, it is possible that other underexplored disease-associated pathways may be more fruitful targets for drug development.\n Findings from gene network analyses implicate immune networks as being enriched in AD; many of the genes in these networks fall within genomic regions that contain common and rare variants that are associated with increased risk of developing AD.\n Of these genes, several (including CR1, SPI1, the MS4As, TREM2, ABCA7, CD33, and INPP5D) are expressed by microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain.\n We summarize the gene network and genetics findings that implicate that these microglial genes are involved in AD, as well as several studies that have looked at the expression and function of these genes in microglia and in the context of AD.\n We propose that these genes are contributing to AD in a non-Aß-dependent

substantial proportion of unexplained risk.\n\n There is evidence that environmental risk factors may explain some of this risk.\n\n Thus, we present the first comprehensive systematic review of environmental risk factors for dementia.\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases from their inception to January 2016, bibliographies of review articles, and articles related to publically available environmental data.\n\n Articles were included if they examined the association between an environmental risk factor and dementia.\n\n Studies with another outcome (for example, cognition), a physiological measure of the exposure, case studies, animal studies, and studies of nutrition were excluded.\n\n Data were extracted from individual studies which were, in turn, appraised for methodological quality.\n\n The strength and consistency of the overall evidence for each risk factor identified was assessed.\n\n\nResults\nWe screened 4784 studies and included 60 in the review.\n\n Risk factors were considered in six categories: air quality, toxic heavy metals, other metals, other trace elements, occupational-related exposures, and miscellaneous environmental factors.\n\n Few studies took a life course approach.\n\n There is at least moderate evidence implicating the following risk factors: air pollution; aluminium; silicon; selenium; pesticides; vitamin D deficiency; and electric and magnetic fields.\n\n\nConclusions\nStudies varied widely in size and quality and therefore we must be circumspect in our conclusions.\n\n Nevertheless, this extensive review suggests that future research could focus on a short list of environmental risk factors for dementia.\n\n Furthermore, further robust, longitudinal studies with repeated measures of environmental exposures are required to confirm these associations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5059894","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lewis O.

hyperphosphorylated tau.\n\n Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests a clear link between type 2 diabetes mellitus and AD.\n\n In AD animal models, tau pathology is exacerbated by metabolic comorbidities, such as insulin resistance and diabetes.\n\n Within this context, anitidiabetic drugs, including the widely-prescribed insulin-sensitizing drug metformin, are currently being investigated for AD therapy.\n\n However, their efficacy for tauopathy in vivo has not been tested.\n\n\nResults\nHere, we report that in the P301S mutant human tau (P301S) transgenic mouse model of tauopathy, chronic administration of metformin exerts paradoxical effects on tau pathology.\n\n Despite reducing tau phosphorylation in the cortex and hippocampus via AMPK/mTOR and PP2A, metformin increases insoluble tau species (including tau oligomers) and the number of inclusions with ?-sheet aggregates in the brain of P301S mice.\n\n In addition, metformin exacerbates hindlimb atrophy, increases P301S hyperactive behavior, induces tau cleavage by caspase 3 and disrupts synaptic structures.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings indicate that metformin pro-aggregation effects mitigate the potential benefits arising from its dephosphorylating action, possibly leading to an overall increase of the risk of tauopathy in elderly diabetic patients.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe

Between the Gut-Brain Axis, Obesity and Cognitive Function","abstract":"Obesity continues to be one of the major public health problems due to its high prevalence and co-morbidities.\n Common co-morbidities not only include cardiometabolic disorders but also mood and cognitive disorders.\n Obese subjects often show deficits in memory, learning and executive functions compared to normal weight subjects.\n Epidemiological studies also indicate that obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing depression and anxiety, and vice versa.\n These associations between pathologies that presumably have different etiologies suggest shared pathological mechanisms.\n Gut microbiota is a mediating factor between the environmental pressures (e.\ng.\n, diet, lifestyle) and host physiology, and its alteration could partly explain the cross-link between those pathologies.\n Westernized dietary patterns are known to be a major cause of the obesity epidemic, which also promotes a dysbiotic drift in the gut microbiota; this, in turn, seems to contribute to obesity-related complications.\n Experimental studies in animal models and, to a lesser extent, in humans suggest that the obesity-associated microbiota may contribute to the endocrine, neurochemical and inflammatory alterations underlying obesity and its comorbidities.\n These include dysregulation of the HPA-axis

Prevents Nigrostriatal Dopamine Degeneration Independent of AMPK Activation in Dopamine Neurons","abstract":"Metformin is a widely prescribed drug used to treat type-2 diabetes, although recent studies show it has wide ranging effects to treat other diseases.\n Animal and retrospective human studies indicate that Metformin treatment is neuroprotective in Parkinson’s Disease (PD), although the neuroprotective mechanism is unknown, numerous studies suggest the beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis may be through AMPK activation.\n In this study we tested whether or not AMPK activation in dopamine neurons was required for the neuroprotective effects of Metformin in PD.\n We generated transgenic mice in which AMPK activity in dopamine neurons was ablated by removing AMPK beta 1 and beta 2 subunits from dopamine transporter expressing neurons.\n These AMPK WT and KO mice were then chronically exposed to Metformin in the drinking water then exposed to MPTP, the mouse model of PD.\n Chronic Metformin treatment significantly attenuated the MPTP-induced loss of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) neuronal number and volume and TH protein concentration in the nigrostriatal pathway.\n Additionally, Metformin treatment prevented the MPTP-induced elevation of the DOPAC:DA ratio regardless of genotype.\n Metformin also prevented MPTP induced gliosis in the Substantia Nigra.\n These neuroprotective actions were independent of genotype and occurred in both AMPK WT and AMPK KO mice.\n Overall, our studies suggest that Metformin’s neuroprotective effects are not due to AMPK activation in dopaminergic neurons and that more research is required to determine how metformin acts to restrict the development of

of Parkinson’s Disease via Autophagy and Mitochondrial ROS Clearance","abstract":"Background:\nOur previous study demonstrated that metabolic inflammation exacerbates dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in type 2 diabetes mice.\n\n Metformin, a typical oral hypoglycemic agent for diabetes, has been regarded as an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase and a regulator of systemic energy metabolism.\n\n Although metformin plays potential protective effects in many disorders, it is unclear whether metformin has a therapeutic role in dopaminergic neuron degeneration in Parkinson’s disease.\n\n\nMethods:\nIn the present study, a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine plus probenecid-induced mouse model of Parkinson’s disease was established to explore the neuroprotective effect of metformin on dopaminergic neurons in substania nigra compacta.\n\n We next cultured SH-SY5Y cells to investigate the mechanisms for the neuroprotective effect of metformin.\n\n\nResults:\nWe showed that treatment with metformin (5mg/mL in drinking water) for 5 weeks significantly ameliorated the degeneration of substania nigra compacta dopaminergic neurons, increased striatal dopaminergic levels, and improved motor impairment induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine plus probenecid.\n\n We further found that metformin inhibited microglia overactivation-induced neuroinflammation in substania nigra compacta of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine plus probenecid Parkinson’s disease mice, which might contribute to the protective effect of metformin on neurodegeneration.\n\n Furthermore, metformin (2mM) activated AMP-activated protein kinase in SH-SY5Y cells, in turn inducing microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II-mediated autophagy and eliminating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.\n\n Consequently, metformin alleviated MPP+-induced cytotoxicity and attenuated neuronal apoptosis.\n\n\nConclusions:\nOur findings demonstrate that metformin may be a pluripotent and promising drug for dopaminergic neuron degeneration, which will give us insight into the potential of metformin in terms of opening up novel therapeutic avenues for Parkinson’s disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5043649","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cunjin","surname":"Su","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Qiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yaqi","surname":"Bian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianhua","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.07.046","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Neuroprotective

pathological inclusions.\n Here we demonstrate that the antidiabetic drug metformin significantly reduces levels of phospho-Ser129 ?-synuclein and the ratio of phospho-Ser129 ?-synuclein to total ?-synuclein.\n This effect was documented in vitro in SH-SY5Y and HeLa cells as well as in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons.\n In vitro work also elucidated the mechanisms underlying metformin's action.\n Following metformin exposure, decreased phospho-Ser129 ?-synuclein was not strictly dependent on induction of AMP-activated protein kinase, a primary target of the drug.\n On the other hand, metformin-induced phospho-Ser129 ?-synuclein reduction was consistently associated with inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A).\n Evidence supporting a key role of mTOR/PP2A signaling included the finding that, similar to metformin, the canonical mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was capable of lowering the ratio of phospho-Ser129 ?-synuclein to total ?-synuclein.\n Furthermore, no decrease in phosphorylated ?-synuclein occurred with either metformin or rapamycin when phosphatase activity was inhibited, supporting a direct relationship between mTOR inhibition, PP2A activation and protein dephosphorylation.\n A final set of experiments confirmed the effectiveness of metformin in vivo in wild-type C57BL/6 mice.\n Addition of the drug to food or drinking water lowered levels of phospho-Ser129 ?-synuclein in the brain of treated animals.\n These data reveal a new mechanism leading to ?-synuclein

characterized by selective degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons.\n\n The primary triggers for motor neuron degeneration are unknown but inflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial defects have been identified as potential contributing factors.\n\n Metformin is an anti-type II diabetes drug that has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, can bring about mitochondrial biogenesis and has been shown to attenuate pathology in mouse models of Huntington's disease and multiple sclerosis.\n\n We therefore hypothesized that it might increase survival in the SOD1G93A murine model of ALS.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nTreatment of male and female SOD1G93A mice (n?=??6 per sex) with 2 mg/ml metformin in the drinking water from 35 days, resulted in a significant increase in motor unit survival, as measured by in vivo electrophysiology at 100 days, in male EDL muscles (24+/?2 vs.\n\n 14+/?2 motor units, p&lt;0.005) and female TA muscles (21+/?1 vs.\n\n 15+/?2 motor units, P?=?0.0134).\n\n We therefore continued to test the effect of 0.5, 2 and 5 mg/ml metformin in the drinking water from 35 days on disease onset and progression (identified by twice weekly determination of weight and neurological score) as well as survival in male and female SOD1G93A mice (n?=??14 per sex).\n\n Results for all groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier time

spectrum of mixed brain pathologies expands beyond accompanying vascular pathology in brains with Alzheimer’s disease-related pathology.\n Co-occurrence of neurodegenerative non-Alzheimer’s disease-type proteinopathies is increasingly recognized to be a frequent event in the brains of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, particularly in older people.\n Owing to the evolving concept of neurodegenerative diseases, clinical and neuropathological diagnostic criteria have changed during the last decades.\n Autopsy-based studies differ in the selection criteria and also in the applied staining methods used.\n The present review summarizes the prevalence of mixed brain pathologies reported in recent community-based studies.\n In these cohorts, irrespective of the clinical symptoms, the frequency of Alzheimer’s disease-related pathology is between 19 and 67%, of Lewy body pathology is between 6 and 39%, of vascular pathologies is between 28 and 70%, of TDP-43 proteinopathy is between 13 and 46%, of hippocampal sclerosis is between 3 and 13% and, finally, of mixed pathologies is between 10 and 74%.\n Some studies also mention tauopathies.\n White-matter pathologies are not discussed specifically in all studies, although these lesions may be present in more than 80% of the aging brains.\n In summary, community-based neuropathology studies have shown that complex constellations of underlying pathologies may lead to cognitive decline, and that the number of possible combinations increases in the aging brain.\n These observations have implications for the prediction of the prognosis, for the development of biomarkers or therapy targets, or for the stratification of patient cohorts for genome-wide studies or, eventually, for therapy trials.\n","id":"PMC4239398","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasmin","surname":"Rahimi","email":"jasmin.rahimi@meduniwien.ac.at","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabor

population-based dataset to investigate the relationship between DM and subsequent AD incidence.\n\n\nMethods\nData were collected from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database, which released a cohort dataset of 1,000,000 randomly sampled people and confirmed it to be representative of the Taiwanese population.\n\n We identified 71,433 patients newly diagnosed with diabetes (age 58.74±14.02 years) since January 1997. Using propensity score, we matched them with 71,311 non-diabetic subjects by time of enrollment, age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous stroke history.\n\n All the patients were followed up to December 31, 2007. The endpoint of the study was occurrence of AD.\n\n\nResults\nOver a maximum 11 years of follow-up, diabetic patients experienced a higher incidence of AD than non-diabetic subjects (0.48% vs.\n\n 0.37%, p&lt;0.001).\n\n After Cox proportional hazard regression model analysis, DM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50–2.07, p&lt;0.001), age (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.10–1.12,

urbanization status (metropolis, HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.07–1.63, p?=?0.009) were independently associated with the increased risk of AD.\n\n Neither monotherapy nor combination therapy with oral antidiabetic medications were associated with the risk of AD after adjusting for underlying risk factors and the duration of DM since diagnosis.\n\n However, combination therapy with insulin was found to be associated with greater risk of AD (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.04–4.52, p?=?0.039).\n\n\nConclusion\nNewly diagnosed DM was associated with increased risk of AD.\n\n Use of hypoglycemic agents did not

Inhibiting the PPP in neuronal cell models causes cell death.\n In rodents, inhibition of this pathway causes selective dopaminergic cell death leading to motor deficits resembling parkinsonism.\n Using postmortem human brain tissue, we characterized glucose metabolism via the PPP in sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and controls.\n AD brains showed increased

Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: What Is Protecting Whom?","abstract":"Multiple studies have shown that antecedent diseases are less prevalent in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients than the general age-matched population, which suggests possible neuroprotection.\n Antecedent disease could be protective against ALS or, conversely, the asymptomatic early physiological underpinnings of ALS could be protective against other antecedent disease.\n Elucidating the impact of antecedent disease on ALS is critical for assessing diagnostic risk factors, prognostic outcomes, and intervention timing.\n The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between antecedent conditions and ALS onset age and disease duration (i.\ne.\n survival).\n Medical history surveys for 1439 Emory ALS Clinic patients (Atlanta, GA, USA) were assessed for antecedent hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, asthma, arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), thyroid, kidney, liver, and other non-ALS neurological diseases.\n The ALS onset age and disease duration are compared between the antecedent and non-antecedent populations using chi square, Kaplan–Meier, and ordinal logistic regression.\n When controlled for confounders, antecedent hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol), arthritis, COPD, thyroid disease, and non-ALS neurological disease are found to be statistically associated with a delayed ALS onset age, whereas antecedent obesity [body mass index (BMI)?&gt;?30] was correlated to earlier ALS onset age.\n With the potential exceptions of liver disease and diabetes (the latter without other common comorbid conditions), antecedent disease is associated with overall shorter ALS disease duration.\n The unique potential relationship between antecedent liver disease and longer ALS disease duration warrants further investigation, especially given liver disease was found to be a factor of 4–7 times less prevalent in ALS.\n Notably, most conditions associated with delayed ALS onset are also associated with shorter disease duration.\n Pathological homeostatic instability exacerbated by hypervigilant regulation (over-zealous homeostatic regulation due to too high regulatory feedback gains) is a viable hypothesis for explaining the early-life protection against antecedent disease and

patients with ALS.\n Levels of tau and pNFH in the cerebrospinal fluid were measured to see if they could serve as prognostic indicators.\n Methods.\n 27 subjects on stable doses of riluzole were enrolled.\n Subjects were randomized to receive pioglitazone 30?mg/d and tretinoin 10?mg/BID for six months or two matching placebos.\n ALSFRS-R scores were followed monthly.\n At baseline and at the

hepatocytes by decreasing cellular energy status","abstract":"Aim/hypothesis\nThe glucose-lowering drug metformin has been shown to activate hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master kinase regulating cellular energy homeostasis.\n\n However, the underlying mechanisms remain controversial and have never been investigated in primary human hepatocytes.\n\n\nMethods\nHepatocytes isolated from rat, mouse and human livers were treated with various concentrations of metformin.\n\n Isoform-specific AMPK? abundance and activity, as well as intracellular adenine nucleotide levels and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates were determined at different time points.\n\n\nResults\nMetformin dose- and time-dependently increased AMPK activity in rat and human hepatocytes, an effect associated with a significant rise in cellular AMP:ATP ratio.\n\n Surprisingly, we found that AMPK?2 activity was undetectable in human compared with rat hepatocytes, while AMPK?1 activities were comparable.\n\n Accordingly, metformin only increased AMPK?1 activity in human hepatocytes, although both AMPK? isoforms were activated in rat hepatocytes.\n\n Analysis of mRNA expression and protein levels confirmed that only AMPK?1 is present in human hepatocytes; it also showed that the distribution of ? and ? regulatory subunits differed between species.\n\n Finally, we demonstrated that the increase in AMP:ATP ratio in hepatocytes from liver-specific Ampk?1/2 (also known as Prkaa1/2) knockout mice and humans is due to a similar and specific inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory-chain complex 1 by metformin.\n\n\nConclusions/interpretation\nActivation of hepatic AMPK by metformin results from a decrease in cellular energy status owing to metformin’s AMPK-independent inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory-chain complex 1. The unique profile of AMPK subunits found in human hepatocytes should be considered when developing new pharmacological agents to target the kinase.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00125-011-2311-5) contains peer-reviewed but unedited supplementary material, which is available to authorised users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3210354","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"X.","surname":"Stephenne","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Foretz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"N.","surname":"Taleux","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"G.

pathological hallmark of AD.\n We find similar results in cultures of primary neurons, a human cell line model of AD and in vivo in mice.\n We show that treatment with metformin decreases BACE1 protein expression by interfering with an mRNA-protein complex that contains the ubiquitin ligase MID1, thereby reducing BACE1 activity.\n Together with our previous findings these results indicate

inhibition of intrinsic apoptotic program, triggered by A-beta and involving caspase 9 and 3 activation.\n A protective role of insulin on mitochondrial damage is also shown by using Mito-red vital dye.\n Furthermore, A-beta activates the stress inducible Hsp70 protein in LAN5 cells and an overexpression is detectable after the addition of insulin, suggesting that this major induction is the necessary condition to activate a cell survival program.\n Together, these results may provide opportunities for the design of preventive and therapeutic strategies against

Inhibits Different Uterine Serous Carcinoma (USC) Cells Proliferation and Migration in p53-Dependent or -Independent Manners","abstract":"Accumulating epidemiological evidence shows that obesity is associated with an increased risk of several types of adult cancers, including endometrial cancer.\n Chronic hyperinsulinemia, a typical hallmark of diabetes, is one of the leading factors responsible for the obesity-cancer connection.\n Numerous cellular and circulating factors are involved in the biochemical chain of events leading from hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance to increased cancer risk and, eventually, tumor development.\n Metformin is an oral anti-diabetic drug of the biguanide family used for treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n Recently, metformin was shown to exhibit anti-proliferative effects in ovarian and Type I endometrial cancer, although the mechanisms responsible for this non-classical metformin action remain unclear.\n The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) play a prominent role in cancer biology and their mechanisms of action are tightly interconnected with the insulin signaling pathways.\n Given the cross-talk between the insulin and IGF signaling pathways, the aim of this study was to examine the hypothesis that the anti-proliferative actions of metformin in uterine serous carcinoma (USC) are potentially mediated via suppression of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) pathway.\n Our results show that metformin interacts with the IGF pathway, and induces apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation and migration of USC cell lines with both wild type and mutant p53. Taken together, our results suggest that metformin therapy could be a novel and attractive therapeutic approach for human USC, a highly aggressive variant of endometrial cancer.\n","id":"PMC3631250","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rive","surname":"Sarfstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yael","surname":"Friedman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zohar","surname":"Attias-Geva","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ami","surname":"Fishman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ilan","surname":"Bruchim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haim","surname":"Werner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Angel","surname":"Nadal","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Angel","surname":"Nadal","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-10-0055","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Metformin

receptor signalling pathway in human pancreatic cancer cells","abstract":"Background\nEpidemiological studies have shown direct associations between type 2 diabetes and obesity, both conditions associated with hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinemia, and the risk of pancreatic cancer.\n\n Up to 80% of pancreatic cancer patients present with either new-onset type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance at the time of diagnosis.\n\n Recent population studies indicate that the incidence of pancreatic cancer is reduced among diabetics taking metformin.\n\n In this study, the effects of exposure of pancreatic cancer cells to high glucose levels on their growth and response to metformin were investigated.\n\n\nMethods\nThe human pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC-1, BxPC-3, PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 were grown in normal (5 mM) or high (25 mM) glucose conditions, with or without metformin.\n\n The influence by metformin on proliferation, apoptosis and the AMPK and IGF-IR signalling pathways were evaluated in vitro.\n\n\nResults\nMetformin significantly reduced the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells under normal glucose conditions.\n\n Hyperglycaemia however, protected against the metformin-induced growth inhibition.\n\n The anti-proliferative actions of metformin were associated with an activation of AMP-activated protein kinase AMPKThr172 together with an inhibition of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor activation and downstream signalling mediators IRS-1 and phosphorylated Akt.\n\n Furthermore, exposure to metformin during normal glucose conditions led to increased apoptosis as measured by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage.\n\n In contrast, exposure to high glucose levels promoted a more robust IGF-I response and Akt activation which correlated to stimulated AMPKSer485 phosphorylation and impaired AMPKThr172 phosphorylation, resulting in reduced anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects by metformin.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur results indicate that metformin has direct anti-tumour activities in pancreatic cancer cells involving AMPKThr172 activation and suppression of the insulin/IGF signalling pathways.\n\n However, hyperglycaemic conditions enhance the insulin/IGF-I responses resulting in an altered AMPK activation profile and prevent metformin from fully switching off the growth promoting signals in pancreatic cancer cells.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3661399","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emelie","surname":"Karnevi","email":"emelie.karnevi@med.lu.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katarzyna","surname":"Said","email":"katarzyna.said@med.lu.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roland","surname":"Andersson","email":"roland.andersson@med.lu.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ann

recently demonstrated that long-term treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway[5], or ablation of the mTOR target p70S6K[6] extends lifespan in mice, possibly by delaying aging.\n\n Whether inhibition of the mTOR pathway would delay or prevent age-associated disease such as AD remained to be determined.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe used rapamycin administration and behavioral tools in a mouse model of AD as well as standard biochemical and immunohistochemical measures in brain tissue to provide answers for this question.\n\n Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of A?42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.\n\n These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can reduce A?42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice.\n\n As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in A? and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of A?.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nOur data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease.\n\n Rapamycin, already used in clinical settings, may be a potentially effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2848616","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Patricia","surname":"Spilman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Natalia","surname":"Podlutskaya","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthew

Metformin-induced AMPK activation was associated with the inhibition of the mTOR signaling without involving AKT.\n Moreover, lymphoma cell response to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin and mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus was significantly enhanced when co-treated with metformin.\n Pharmacologic and molecular knock-down of AMPK attenuated metformin-mediated lymphoma cell growth inhibition and drug sensitization.\n In vivo, metformin induced AMPK activation, mTOR inhibition and remarkably blocked tumor growth in murine lymphoma xenografts.\n Of note, metformin was equally effective when given orally.\n Combined treatment of oral metformin with doxorubicin or temsirolimus triggered lymphoma cell autophagy and functioned more efficiently than either agent alone.\n Taken together, these data provided first evidence for the growth-inhibitory and drug-sensitizing effect of metformin on lymphoma.\n Selectively targeting mTOR pathway through AMPK activation may thus represent a promising new strategy to improve treatment of lymphoma patients.\n","id":"PMC3317343","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"W-Y","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L-H","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Z-X","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Z-X","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S-J","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"W-L","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/carcin/bgt231","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Metformin

mtDNA depletion profoundly impairs oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), triggering calcium-dependent stress signaling and adaptive metabolic responses3.\n However, the cellular responses to mtDNA

Furthermore, we demonstrate that herpesviruses induce mtDNA stress, which potentiates antiviral signaling and type I interferon responses during infection.\n Our results further demonstrate that

during obesity.\n C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to induce obesity-associated NAFLD and treated with metformin (150 mg/kg/d) orally for the last four weeks of HFD feeding.\n Compared with HFD-fed control mice, metformin-treated mice showed improvement in both glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.\n Also, metformin treatment caused a significant decrease in liver weight, but not adiposity.\n As indicated by histological changes, metformin treatment decreased hepatic steatosis, but not the size of adipocytes.\n In addition, metformin treatment caused an increase in the phosphorylation of liver AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which was accompanied by an increase in the phosphorylation of liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase and decreases in the phosphorylation of liver c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and in the mRNA levels of lipogenic enzymes and proinflammatory cytokines.\n However, metformin treatment did not significantly alter adipose tissue AMPK phosphorylation and inflammatory responses.\n In cultured hepatocytes, metformin treatment increased AMPK phosphorylation and decreased fat deposition and inflammatory responses.\n Additionally, in bone marrow-derived macrophages, metformin treatment partially blunted the effects of lipopolysaccharide on inducing the phosphorylation of JNK1 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) p65

movement disorder of largely unknown etiology.\n\n We have previously shown that loss-of-function mutations of the mitochondrial protein kinase PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) cause the recessive PARK6 variant of PD.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nNow we generated a PINK1 deficient mouse and observed several novel phenotypes: A progressive reduction of weight and of locomotor activity selectively for spontaneous movements occurred at old age.\n\n As in PD, abnormal dopamine levels in the aged nigrostriatal projection accompanied the reduced movements.\n\n Possibly in line with the PARK6 syndrome but in contrast to sporadic PD, a reduced lifespan, dysfunction of brainstem and sympathetic nerves, visible aggregates of ?-synuclein within Lewy bodies or nigrostriatal

Overexpression of human TRAP1 was able to rescue these phenotypes.\n Similarly, human TRAP1 overexpression in rat primary cortical neurons rescued [A53T]?-Synuclein–induced sensitivity to rotenone treatment.\n In human (non)neuronal cell lines, small interfering RNA directed against TRAP1 enhanced [A53T]?-Synuclein–induced sensitivity to oxidative stress treatment.\n [A53T]?-Synuclein directly

mitonuclear protein imbalance, reducing mitochondrial respiration and activating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt).\n Specific antibiotics targeting mitochondrial translation and ethidium bromide, which impairs mitochondrial DNA transcription, pharmacologically mimic mrp knockdown and extend lifespan by inducing mitonuclear protein imbalance, also in mammalian cells.\n In addition, resveratrol and rapamycin, longevity compounds acting on different molecular targets, similarly induced mitonuclear protein imbalance, UPRmt and lifespan extention in C.\n elegans.\n Collectively these data demonstrate that MRPs represent an evolutionary conserved protein family that ties the mitochondrial ribosome and mitonuclear protein imbalance to UPRmt, an overarching

exhibited neuroprotective effects against MPP+ toxicity.\n However, the molecular mechanism is not fully understood.\n In this study, we found that Sal significantly prevented MPP+-induced decrease of mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2, GCLc, SOD1, and SOD2 in SH-SY5Y cells.\n Moreover, silencing of Nrf2 significantly inhibited Sal-induced increase in mRNA and protein expression of GCLc, SOD1, and SOD2. But Nrf2 silence did not significantly impact Sal-exhibited effects on DJ-1 expression.\n Silencing of Nrf2 significantly suppressed the decrease of apoptosis induced by Sal in MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells.\n Sal significantly prevented MPP+-induced decrease of the mRNA and protein expression of DJ-1 in SH-SY5Y cells.\n Moreover, silencing of DJ-1 significantly inhibited Sal-induced increase in mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2, GCLc, SOD1, and SOD2 in MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells.\n These results indicated that DJ-1 was an upstream regulator of Nrf2 in the neuroprotective effects of Sal.\n Furthermore, silencing of DJ-1 significantly suppressed the decrease of apoptosis induced by Sal in MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells.\n In conclusion, Sal prevented MPP+-induced neurotoxicity through upregulation of DJ-1-Nrf2-antioxidant pathway.\n Our findings provide novel insights into the neuroprotective effects of Sal against

gluconeogenesis by inhibiting mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase","abstract":"id='P1'>Metformin is considered to be one of the most effective therapeutics for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) since it specifically reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis without increasing insulin secretion, inducing weight gain, or posing a risk of hypoglycemia1,2.\n For over half a century, this agent has been prescribed to T2D patients worldwide, yet the underlying mechanism by which metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis remains unknown.\n Here we show that metformin non-competitively inhibits the redox shuttle enzyme mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD), resulting in an altered hepatocellular redox state, reduced conversion of lactate and glycerol to glucose, and decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis.\n Acute and chronic low-dose metformin treatment effectively reduced endogenous glucose production (EGP), while increasing cytosolic redox and decreasing mitochondrial redox states.\n Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) knockdown of hepatic mGPD in rats resulted in a phenotype akin to chronic metformin treatment, and abrogated metformin-mediated increases in cytosolic redox state, decrease in plasma glucose concentrations and inhibition of EGP.\n These findings were replicated in whole-body mGPD knockout mice.\n These results have significant implications for understanding the mechanism of metformin’s blood glucose lowering effects and provide a novel therapeutic target for T2D.\n","id":"PMC4074244","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anila K.","surname":"Madiraju","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Derek

the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 2.3 million people, killed over 160,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption1,2.\n There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy, nor are there vaccines for its prevention, and these efforts are hampered by limited knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n To address this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), identifying 332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs).\n Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (29 FDA-approved drugs, 12 drugs in clinical trials, and 28 preclinical compounds).\n Screening a subset of these in multiple viral assays identified two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors.\n Further studies of these host factor targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19.","id":"PMC7431030","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David E.","surname":"Gordon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gwendolyn

helped us identify how thrombosis can appear in different organs at different times and thrombi be detected for weeks after infection in one site, yet largely be resolved within 24 h in another.\n Furthermore, we discuss the observation that thrombi induced to Salmonella Typhimurium are largely devoid of bacteria.\n Finally, we discuss the value of different therapeutic approaches to target

betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the age-associated vulnerability in the burden of disease and put aging research in the spotlight.\n The limited data available indicates that COVID-19 should be referred to as a gerolavic (from Greek, géros “old man” and epilavís, “harmful”) infection because the infection rates, severity, and lethality are substantially higher in the population aged 60 and older.\n This is primarily due to comorbidity but may be partially due to immunosenescence, decreased immune function in the elderly, and general loss of function, fitness, and increased frailty associated with aging.\n Immunosenescence is a major factor affecting vaccination response, as well as the severity and lethality of infectious diseases.\n While vaccination reduces infection rates, and therapeutic interventions reduce the severity and lethality of infections, these interventions have limitations.\n Previous studies showed that postulated geroprotectors, such as sirolimus (rapamycin) and its close derivative rapalog everolimus (RAD001), decreased infection rates in a small sample of elderly patients.\n This article presents a review of the limited literature available on geroprotective and senoremediative interventions that may be investigated to decrease the disease burden of gerolavic infections.\n This article also highlights a need for rigorous clinical validation of deep aging clocks as surrogate markers of biological age.\n These could be used to assess the need for, and efficacy of, geroprotective and senoremediative interventions and provide better protection for elderly populations from gerolavic infections.\n This article does not represent medical advice and the medications described are not yet licensed or recommended as immune system boosters, as they have not undergone clinical evaluation for this

and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal

We examined skin and lung tissues from 5 patients with severe COVID-19 characterized by respiratory failure (n= 5) and purpuric skin rash (n?=?3).\n COVID-19 pneumonitis was predominantly a pauci-inflammatory septal capillary injury with significant septal capillary mural and luminal fibrin deposition and permeation of the interalveolar septa by neutrophils.\n No viral cytopathic changes were observed and the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membranes, inflammation, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hallmarks of classic acute respiratory distress syndrome, were not prominent.\n These pulmonary findings were accompanied by significant deposits of terminal complement components C5b-9 (membrane attack complex), C4d, and mannose binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)2, in the microvasculature, consistent with sustained, systemic activation of the complement pathways.\n The purpuric skin lesions similarly showed a pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy, with deposition of C5b-9 and C4d in both grossly involved and normally-appearing skin.\n In addition, there was co-localization of COVID-19 spike glycoproteins with C4d and C5b-9 in the interalveolar septa and the cutaneous microvasculature of 2 cases examined.\n In conclusion, at least a subset of sustained, severe COVID-19 may define a type of catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of complement pathways and an associated procoagulant state.\n It provides a foundation for further exploration of the pathophysiologic importance of complement in COVID-19, and could suggest targets for specific

Metformin, the most common used anti-type-2 diabetes medicine, has been linked to reduced cancer risk and better diagnosis.\n We found that metformin was able to inhibit PCa cell migration, which correlates with tumor metastatic capability.\n The pathogenesis and progression of tumors are closely related to dysregulated gene expression in tumor cells through epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation and histone modifications.\n We found that the level of SUV39H1, a histone methyltransferase of H3 Lys9, was reduced in metformin-treated PCa cells in a time-dependent manner.\n SUV39H1 overexpression increased PCa migration, whereas SUV39H1 depletion suppressed PCa cell migration.\n There is a positive correlation between SUV39H1 expression and PCa pathological stages.\n We further showed that both metformin treatment and SUV39H1 knockout in PCa cells can reduce integrin ?V and ?1 proteins, as well as their downstream phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) levels, which is essential for functional adhesion signaling and tumor cell migration.\n Taken together, metformin reduced SUV39H1 to inhibit migration of PCa cells via disturbing the integrin-FAK signaling.\n Our

pathogenesis, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-? plays a key regulatory role in myofibroblast differentiation.\n\n Reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been proposed to be involved in the mechanism for TGF-?-induced myofibroblast differentiation.\n\n Metformin is a biguanide antidiabetic medication and its pharmacological action is mediated through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which regulates not only energy homeostasis but also stress responses, including ROS.\n\n Therefore, we sought to investigate the inhibitory role of metformin in lung fibrosis development via modulating TGF-? signaling.\n\n\nMethods\nTGF-?-induced myofibroblast differentiation in lung fibroblasts (LF) was used for in vitro models.\n\n The anti-fibrotic role of metfromin was examined in a bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis model.\n\n\nResults\nWe found that TGF-?-induced myofibroblast differentiation was clearly inhibited by metformin treatment in LF.\n\n Metformin-mediated activation of AMPK was responsible for inhibiting TGF-?-induced NOX4 expression.\n\n NOX4 knockdown and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment illustrated that NOX4-derived ROS generation was critical for TGF-?-induced SMAD phosphorylation and myofibroblast differentiation.\n\n BLM treatment induced development of lung fibrosis with concomitantly enhanced NOX4 expression and SMAD phosphorylation, which was efficiently inhibited by metformin.\n\n Increased NOX4 expression levels were also observed in FF of IPF lungs and LF isolated from IPF patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings suggest that metformin can be a promising anti-fibrotic modality of treatment for IPF affected by

development, homeostasis, and repair.\n The final common pathway for all of these positively adaptive properties of the lung is the expression of epithelial parathyroid-hormone-related protein, and its binding to its receptor on the mesenchyme, inducing PPAR? expression by lipofibroblasts.\n Lipofibroblasts then produce leptin, which binds to alveolar type II cells, stimulating their production of surfactant, which is necessary for both evolutionary and physiologic adaptation to atmospheric oxygen from fish to man.\n A wide variety of molecular insults disrupt such highly evolved physiologic cell-cell interactions, ranging from overdistention to oxidants, infection, and nicotine, all of which predictably cause loss of mesenchymal peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR?) expression and the transdifferentiation of lipofibroblasts to myofibroblasts, the signature cell type for lung fibrosis.\n By exploiting such deep cell-molecular functional homologies as targets for leveraging lung homeostasis, we have discovered that we can effectively prevent and/or reverse the deleterious effects of these pathogenic agents, demonstrating the utility of evolutionary biology for the prevention and treatment of chronic lung disease.\n By understanding mechanisms of health and disease as an evolutionary continuum rather than as dissociated processes, we can evolve predictive

(AMPK)-dependent and AMPK-independent mechanisms","abstract":"People with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have reduced bone mineral density and an increased risk of fractures due to altered mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation in the bone marrow.\n This leads to a shift in the balance of differentiation away from bone formation (osteogenesis) in favour of fat cell development (adipogenesis).\n The commonly used anti-diabetic drug, metformin, activates the osteogenic transcription factor Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), which may suppress adipogenesis, leading to improved bone health.\n Here we investigate the involvement of the metabolic enzyme, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in these protective actions of metformin.\n The anti-adipogenic actions of metformin were observed in multipotent C3H10T1/2 MSCs, in which metformin exerted reciprocal control over the activities of Runx2 and the adipogenic transcription factor, PPAR?, leading to suppression of adipogenesis.\n These effects appeared to be independent of AMPK activation but rather through the suppression of the mTOR/p70S6K signalling pathway.\n Basal AMPK and mTOR/p70S6K activity did appear to be required for adipogenesis, as demonstrated by the use of the AMPK inhibitor, compound C.\n This observation was further supported by using AMPK knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) where adipogenesis, as assessed by reduced lipid accumulation and expression of the adipogeneic transcription factor, C/EBP?, was found to display an absolute requirement for AMPK.\n Further activation of AMPK in wild type MEFS, with either metformin or the AMPK-specific activator, A769662, was also associated with suppression of adipogenesis.\n It appears, therefore, that basal AMPK activity is required for adipogenesis and that metformin can inhibit adipogenesis through AMPK-dependent or -independent mechanisms, depending on the cellular context.\n","id":"PMC5228588","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Suet

reductions) in observational studies","abstract":"Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to estimate the effects of treatments on health outcomes using observational data.\n There are four methods for using the propensity score to estimate treatment effects: covariate adjustment using the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, propensity-score matching, and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score.\n When outcomes are binary, the effect of treatment on the outcome can be described using odds ratios, relative risks, risk differences, or the number needed to treat.\n Several clinical commentators suggested that risk differences and numbers needed to treat are more meaningful for clinical decision making than are odds ratios or relative risks.\n However, there is a paucity of information about the relative performance of the different propensity-score methods for estimating risk differences.\n We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations to examine this issue.\n We examined bias, variance estimation, coverage of confidence intervals, mean-squared error (MSE), and type I error rates.\n A doubly robust version of IPTW had superior performance compared with the other propensity-score methods.\n It resulted in unbiased estimation of risk differences, treatment effects with the lowest standard errors, confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates, and correct type I error rates.\n Stratification, matching on the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score resulted in minor to modest bias in estimating risk differences.\n Estimators based on IPTW had lower MSE compared with other propensity-score methods.\n Differences between IPTW and propensity-score matching may reflect that these two methods estimate the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect for the treated, respectively.\n Copyright © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons,

cardiovascular diseases and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n Recent studies have reported interactions between statin treatment and COVID-19-related outcomes.\n\n The study reported here specifically assessed the association between routine statin use and COVID-19-related outcomes in inpatients with T2DM.\n\n\nMethods\nThe Coronavirus–SARS-CoV-2 and Diabetes Outcomes (CORONADO) study was a nationwide observational study aiming to describe the phenotypic characteristics and prognosis of T2DM patients with COVID-19 admitted to 68 French hospitals between 10 March and 10 April 2020. The composite primary outcome comprised tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 and 28 days of admission.\n\n The association between statin use and outcomes was estimated by logistic regression analysis after applying inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using a propensity score-weighting approach.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 2449 patients with T2DM (881 women, 1568 men; aged 70.9?±?12.5 years) suitable for analysis, 1192 (49%) were using statin treatment before admission.\n\n In unadjusted analyses, patients using statins had rates of the primary outcome similar to those of non-users within both 7 (29.8% vs 27.0%, respectively; P?=?0.1338) and 28 days (36.2% vs 33.8%, respectively; P?=?0.2191) of admission.\n\n However, mortality rates were significantly higher in statin users within 7 (12.8% vs 9.8%, respectively; P?=?0.02) and 28 days (23.9% vs 18.2%, respectively; P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n After applying IPTW, significant associations were observed with statin use and the primary outcome within 7 days (OR [95% CI]: 1.38 [1.04–1.83]) and with death within both 7 (OR [95% CI]: 1.74 [1.13–2.65]) and 28 days (OR [95% CI]: 1.46 [1.08–1.95]).\n\n\nConclusion\nRoutine

have implicated the presence of the clotting initiator protein, tissue factor (TF), in circulating tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) with thrombotic manifestations in certain cancer types.\n Tumor cells, as well as tumor-derived EVs, may activate and promote platelet aggregation by TF-dependent and independent pathways.\n Cancer cells and their secreted EVs may also facilitate the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which may contribute to thrombus development.\n Alternatively, the presence of polyphosphate (polyP) in tumor-derived EVs may promote thrombosis through a TF-independent route.\n We conclude that the contribution of EVs to cancer coagulopathy is quite complex, in which one or more mechanisms may take place in a certain cancer type.\n In this

factors in patients with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19: Findings from the CORONADO study and other recent reports","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus is challenging in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients.\n As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection.\n This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly China and the US.\n Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance.\n Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits.\n While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, but whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown.\n In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified.\n Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection.\n Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.\n","id":"PMC7241378","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"A.J.","surname":"Scheen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Marre","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"C.","surname":"Thivolet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMsa2011686","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hospitalization

an integrated-delivery health system (Ochsner Health) in Louisiana between March 1 and April 11, 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19) on qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay.\n\n The Ochsner Health population is 31% black non-Hispanic and 65% white non-Hispanic.\n\n The primary outcomes were

Emerging Threat of (Micro)Thrombosis in COVID-19 and Its Therapeutic Implications","abstract":"The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing global pandemic has presented a health emergency of unprecedented magnitude.\n Recent clinical data has highlighted that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a significant risk of thrombotic complications ranging from microvascular thrombosis, venous thromboembolic disease, and stroke.\n Importantly, thrombotic complications are markers of severe COVID-19 and are associated with multiorgan failure and increased mortality.\n The evidence to date supports the concept that the thrombotic manifestations of severe COVID-19 are due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to invade endothelial cells via ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which is expressed on the endothelial cell surface.\n However, in patients with COVID-19 the subsequent endothelial inflammation, complement activation, thrombin generation, platelet, and leukocyte recruitment, and the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses culminate in immunothrombosis, ultimately causing (micro)thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.\n Accordingly, the activation of coagulation (eg, as measured with plasma D-dimer) and thrombocytopenia have emerged as prognostic markers in COVID-19. Given thrombotic complications are central determinants of the high mortality rate in COVID-19, strategies to prevent thrombosis are of critical importance.\n Several antithrombotic drugs have been proposed as potential therapies to prevent COVID-19-associated thrombosis, including heparin, FXII inhibitors, fibrinolytic drugs, nafamostat, and dipyridamole, many of which also possess pleiotropic anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects.\n The growing awareness and mechanistic understanding of the prothrombotic state of COVID-19 patients are driving efforts to more stringent diagnostic screening for thrombotic complications and to the early institution of antithrombotic drugs, for both the prevention and therapy of thrombotic complications.\n The shifting paradigm of diagnostic and treatment strategies holds significant promise to reduce the burden of thrombotic complications and ultimately improve the prognosis for patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7386875","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"James D.","surname":"McFadyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hannah","surname":"Stevens","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Karlheinz","surname":"Peter","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1182/blood.2020006000","date":"2020-04-27","title":"COVID-19 and its implications for thrombosis and anticoagulation","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced infection can be associated with a coagulopathy, findings consistent with infection-induced inflammatory changes as observed in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).\n The lack of prior immunity to COVID-19 has resulted in large numbers of infected patients across the globe and uncertainty regarding management of the complications that arise in the course of this viral illness.\n The lungs are the target organ for COVID-19; patients develop acute lung injury that can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur.\n The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen-degradation products, whereas abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations.\n Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested.\n COVID-19–associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC.\n Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full-intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated.\n Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with COVID-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with DIC, have not been reported.\n If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of DIC and bleeding should be followed.\n","id":"PMC7273827","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jean M.","surname":"Connors","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jerrold H.","surname":"Levy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jvs.2020.05.015","date":"2020-05-05","title":"The need to manage the risk of thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients","abstract":"COVID-19 first appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019.

Each glucose-lowering drug user was matched with a user of other glucose-lowering drugs in a 1:1 manner by propensity scores.\n\n In order to assess the adequacy of propensity score matching, we used the standardized mean difference found in patient characteristics after matching.\n\n There was considered to be a significant imbalance in the group if a standardized mean difference &gt;?10% was found.\n\n To evaluate the association between treatment and study outcomes, both conditional logit and mixed effect logistic regressions were used when the sample size was ??100.\nResults\nid='Par3'>A total of 2666 patients were found in the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, 1297 on glucose-lowering drugs in monotherapy and 465 in combination with metformin.\n\n After propensity matching, 249 patients on metformin, 105 on dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, 129 on insulin, 127 on metformin/dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, 34 on metformin/sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and 67 on metformin/insulin were selected.\n\n No at-home glucose-lowering drugs showed a significant association with in-hospital death; the composite outcome of the need of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death; in-hospital complications; or long-time hospital stays.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted for COVID-19, at-home glucose-lowering drugs showed no significant association with mortality and adverse outcomes.\n\n Given the close relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 and the limited evidence on the role of glucose-lowering drugs, prospective studies are needed.\n\n\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12916-020-01832-2.\n","id":"PMC7666969","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Luis M.","surname":"Pérez-Belmonte","email":"luismiguelpb1984@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"José David","surname":"Torres-Peña","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"María D.","surname":"López-Carmona","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks.\n A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative.\n Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected.\n There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected.\n The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend.\n If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30?000 infected patients.\n Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks.\n If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3–4 days, departing from the exponential trend.\n However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.\n","id":"PMC7102589","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Andrea","surname":"Remuzzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Remuzzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.2337/dc20-0723","date":"2020-05-08","title":"Outcomes in Patients With Hyperglycemia Affected by COVID-19: Can We Do More on Glycemic Control?","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nAn important prognostic factor in any form of infection seems to be glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n There is no information about the effects of tight glycemic control on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in patients with hyperglycemia.\n\n Therefore, we examined the effects of optimal glycemic control in patients with hyperglycemia affected by COVID-19.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nFifty-nine patients with COVID-19 hospitalized with moderate disease were evaluated.\n\n On the basis of admission glycemia &gt;7.77 mmol/L, patients were divided into hyperglycemic and normoglycemic groups.\n\n Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and D-dimer levels were evaluated at admission and weekly during hospitalization.\n\n The composite end point was severe disease, admission to an intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-four (57.6%) patients were normoglycemic and 25 (42.4%) were hyperglycemic.\n\n In the hyperglycemic group, 7 (28%) and 18 (72%) patients were diagnosed with diabetes already before admission, and 10 (40%) and 15 (60%) were treated without and with insulin infusion, respectively.\n\n The mean of glycemia during hospitalization was 10.65 ± 0.84 mmol/L in the no insulin infusion group and 7.69 ± 1.85 mmol/L in the insulin infusion group.\n\n At baseline, IL-6 and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the hyperglycemic group than in the normoglycemic group (P &lt;

Consequently, tailored anti?inflammatory and immune therapies in addition to chronic antihypertensive therapy, could prevent a worse prognosis, as well as improve the clinical outcomes in patients

virus, especially to SARS-CoV-2, from the aspects of anatomical, reproductive endocrine and immune changes during pregnancy and screens effective and fetal-safe treatments from the existing drugs.\n The anatomical structure of the respiratory system is changed during pregnancy, and the virus transmitted by droplets and aerosols is more easily inhaled by pregnant women and is difficult to remove.\n Furthermore, the prognosis is worse after infection when compared with non-pregnancy women.\n And changes in reproductive hormones and immune systems during pregnancy collectively make them more susceptible to certain infections.\n More importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, has been proven highly increased during pregnancy, which may contribute to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. When it comes to treatment, specific drugs for COVID-19 have not been found at present, and taking old drugs for new use in treating COVID-19 has become an emergency method for the pandemic.\n Particularly, drugs that show superior maternal and fetal safety are worthy of consideration for pregnant women with COVID-19, such as chloroquine, metformin, statins, lobinavir/ritonavir, glycyrrhizic acid, and nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery (NMDD), etc.\n Pregnant women are susceptible to COVID-19, and special attention should be paid to the selection of drugs that are both effective for maternal diseases and friendly to the fetus.\n However, there are still many deficiencies in the study of drug safety during pregnancy, and broad-spectrum, effective and fetal-safe drugs for pregnant women need to be developed so as to cope with more infectious diseases in the future.\n","id":"PMC7178925","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaoxuan","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuepeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongyan","surname":"Xi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Qu","email":"syqufan@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoling","surname":"Feng","email":"Doctorfxl@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00125-020-05164-x","date":"2020-04-20","title":"Prevention and management of COVID-19 among patients with diabetes: an appraisal of the literature","abstract":"Electronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00125-020-05164-x) contains peer-reviewed but unedited supplementary material including a slideset of the figures for download, which is available to authorised users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7220850","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Prasad","surname":"Katulanda","email":"prasad.katulanda@clinmed.cmb.ac.lk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Harsha A.","surname":"Dissanayake","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Harsha A.","surname":"Dissanayake","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ishara","surname":"Ranathunga","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ishara","surname":"Ranathunga","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vithiya","surname":"Ratnasamy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vithiya","surname":"Ratnasamy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Piyumi S.

hospitalized for COVID-19: Findings from the CORONADO study and other recent reports","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus is challenging in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients.\n As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection.\n This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly China and the US.\n Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance.\n Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits.\n While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, but whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown.\n In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified.\n Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection.\n Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.\n","id":"PMC7241378","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"A.J.","surname":"Scheen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Marre","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"C.","surname":"Thivolet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

patients with COVID-19 by stratifying the comorbidity status.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analysed data from 1590 laboratory confirmed hospitalised patients from 575 hospitals in 31 provinces/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across mainland China between 11 December 2019 and 31 January 2020. We analysed the composite end-points, which consisted of admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation or death.\n\n The risk of reaching the composite end-points was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities.\n\n\nResults\nThe mean age was 48.9?years and 686 (42.7%) patients were female.\n\n Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population.\n\n 131 (8.2%) patients reached the composite end-points.\n\n 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity.\n\n The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%).\n\n 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities.\n\n After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD (HR (95% CI) 2.681 (1.424–5.048)), diabetes (1.59 (1.03–2.45)), hypertension (1.58

angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics and the likelihood of a positive or negative result on Covid-19 testing as well as the likelihood of severe illness (defined as intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death) among patients who tested positive.\n\n Using Bayesian methods, we compared outcomes in patients who had been treated with these medications and in untreated patients, overall and in those with hypertension, after propensity-score matching for receipt of each medication class.\n\n A difference of at least 10 percentage points was prespecified as a substantial difference.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 12,594 patients who were tested for Covid-19, a total of 5894 (46.8%) were positive; 1002 of these patients (17.0%) had severe illness.\n\n A history of hypertension was present in 4357 patients (34.6%), among whom 2573 (59.1%) had a positive test; 634 of these patients (24.6%) had severe illness.\n\n There was no association between any single medication class and an increased likelihood of a positive test.\n\n None of the medications examined was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of severe illness among patients who tested positive.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe found no substantial increase in the likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 or in the risk of severe Covid-19 among patients who tested positive in association with five common classes of antihypertensive medications.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7206932","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Harmony

distributional and temporal patterns of liver injury indicators in these patients and determined their associated factors and death risk.\n\n Longitudinal liver function tests were retrospectively analyzed and correlated with the risk factors and death.\n\n Liver injury dynamic patterns differed in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBIL).\n\n AST elevated first, followed by ALT, in severe patients.\n\n ALP modestly increased during hospitalization and largely remained in the normal range.\n\n The fluctuation in TBIL levels was mild in the non?severe and the severe groups.\n\n AST abnormality was associated with the highest mortality risk compared with the other indicators of liver injury during hospitalization.\n\n Common factors associated with elevated liver injury indicators were lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count increase, and male gender.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe dynamic patterns of liver injury indicators and their potential risk factors may provide an important explanation for the COVID?19?associated liver injury.\n\n Because elevated liver injury indicators, particularly

the single obese person, but a large prevalence of obese individuals within the population might increase the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout

lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

(rhACE2), could attenuate acute lung injury.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We conducted a two-part phase II trial comprising an open-label intrapatient dose escalation and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase in ten intensive care units in North America.\n\n Patients were between the ages of 18 and 80 years, had an American-European Consensus Criteria consensus diagnosis of ARDS, and had been mechanically ventilated for less than 72 h.\n\n In part A, open-label GSK2586881 was administered at doses from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.8 mg/kg to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.\n\n Following review of data from part A, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of twice-daily doses of GSK2586881 (0.4 mg/kg) for 3 days was conducted (part B).\n\n Biomarkers, physiological assessments, and clinical endpoints were collected over the dosing period and during follow-up.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Dose escalation in part A was well-tolerated

Heterogeneity and publication bias were taken care by meta-regression, sub-group analyses, and trim and fill methods.\n\n\nResults\nWe included 33 studies (16,003 patients) and found diabetes to be significantly associated with mortality of COVID-19 with a pooled odds ratio of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.37–2.64; p &lt; 0.01).\n\n Diabetes was also associated with severe COVID-19 with a pooled odds ratio of 2.75 (95% CI: 2.09–3.62; p &lt; 0.01).\n\n The combined corrected pooled odds ratio of mortality or severity was 2.16 (95% CI: 1.74–2.68; p &lt; 0.01).\n\n The pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 was 9.8% (95% CI: 8.7%–10.9%) (after adjusting for heterogeneity).\n\n\nConclusions\nDiabetes in patients with COVID-19 is associated with a two-fold increase in mortality as well as severity of COVID-19, as compared to non-diabetics.\n\n Further studies on the pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic implications need to be done.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7200339","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ashish","surname":"Kumar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anil","surname":"Arora","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Praveen","surname":"Sharma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shrihari Anil","surname":"Anikhindi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Naresh","surname":"Bansal","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vikas","surname":"Singla","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shivam","surname":"Khare","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abhishyant","surname":"Srivastava","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Understanding the odds ratio and the relative risk","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.15585/mmwr.mm6913e2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Preliminary Estimates of the Prevalence of Selected Underlying Health Conditions Among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 — United States, February 12–March 28, 2020","abstract":"","id":"PMC7119513","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Chow","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Katherine","surname":"Fleming-Dutra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ryan","surname":"Gierke","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Aron","surname":"Hall","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"Hughes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tamara","surname":"Pilishvili","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Ritchey","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Katherine","surname":"Roguski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tami","surname":"Skoff","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emily","surname":"Ussery","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

article reviews the correlation between ACE2 and COVID-19 and the resulting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).\n The classical ACE-angiotensin ? (Ang II)-angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis and the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in RAS system.\n ACE2 antagonises the activation of the classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis and protects against lung injury.\n Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) also uses ACE2 for cell entry.\n ARDS is a clinical high-mortality disease which is probably due to the excessive activation of RAS caused by 2019-nCoV infection, and ACE2 has a protective effect on ARDS caused by COVID-19. Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on ARDS, the development of drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the near future.\n In the meantime, however, the use of RAS blockers such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers that inhibit the damaging (ACE-Ang II) arm of the RAS cascade in the lung may also be promising.\n Trial registration number: NCT04287686.","id":"PMC10016912","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaoqing","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuren","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Shuren","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shaoqian","surname":"Niu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected-Interim guidance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WHO Director-General'sremarks at the media briefing on 2019-nCoV on 11 February 2020","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41);

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

implicated in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n We postulated that repleting ACE2 using GSK2586881, a recombinant form of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2), could attenuate acute lung injury.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We conducted a two-part phase II trial comprising an open-label intrapatient dose escalation and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase in ten intensive care units in North America.\n\n Patients were between the ages of 18 and 80 years, had an American-European Consensus Criteria consensus diagnosis of ARDS, and had been mechanically ventilated for less than 72 h.\n\n In part A, open-label GSK2586881 was administered at doses from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.8 mg/kg to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.\n\n Following review of data from part A, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of twice-daily doses of GSK2586881 (0.4 mg/kg) for 3 days was conducted (part B).\n\n Biomarkers, physiological assessments, and clinical endpoints were collected over the dosing period and during follow-up.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Dose escalation in part A was well-tolerated without clinically significant hemodynamic changes.\n\n Part B was terminated after 39 of the planned 60 patients following a planned futility analysis.\n\n Angiotensin II levels decreased rapidly following infusion of GSK2586881, whereas angiotensin-(1–7) and angiotensin-(1–5) levels increased and remained elevated for 48 h.\n\n Surfactant protein D concentrations were increased, whereas there was a trend for a decrease in interleukin-6 concentrations in rhACE2-treated subjects compared with placebo.\n\n No significant differences were noted in ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen, oxygenation index, or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>GSK2586881 was well-tolerated in patients with ARDS, and the rapid

the possible mechanisms.\n ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin?angiotensin system (RAS).\n The classical RAS ACE?Ang II?AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2?Ang 1?7?MasR counter?regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans.\n ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes.\n ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n Similar to SARS?CoV, SARS?CoV?2 also uses the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells.\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical high?mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury.\n Current research shows that the poor prognosis of patients with COVID?19 is related to factors such as sex (male), age (&gt;60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), secondary ARDS, and other relevant factors.\n Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein?based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one

as COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 infections commonly are older and have a history of hypertension.\n Almost 75% of patients who have died in the pandemic in Italy had hypertension.\n This raised multiple questions regarding a more severe course of COVID-19 in relation to hypertension itself as well as its treatment with renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, e.\ng.\n angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).\n We provide a critical review on the relationship of hypertension, RAS, and risk of lung injury.\n We demonstrate lack of sound evidence that hypertension per se is an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Interestingly, ACEIs and ARBs may be associated with lower incidence and/or improved outcome in patients with lower respiratory tract infections.\n We also review in detail the molecular mechanisms linking the RAS to lung damage and the potential clinical impact of treatment with RAS blockers in patients with COVID-19 and a high cardiovascular and renal risk.\n This is related to the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, and expression of ACE2 in the lung, cardiovascular system, kidney, and other tissues.\n In summary, a critical review of available evidence does not support a deleterious effect of RAS blockers in COVID-19 infections.\n Therefore, there is currently no reason to discontinue RAS blockers in stable patients facing the COVID-19 pandemic.\n ","id":"PMC7184480","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Reinhold","surname":"Kreutz","email":"reinhold.kreutz@charite.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Engi Abd El-Hady","surname":"Algharably","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Engi Abd El-Hady","surname":"Algharably","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michel","surname":"Azizi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Piotr","surname":"Dobrowolski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tomasz","surname":"Guzik","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tomasz","surname":"Guzik","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrzej","surname":"Januszewicz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexandre","surname":"Persu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Aleksander","surname":"Prejbisz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Aleksander","surname":"Prejbisz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas Günther","surname":"Riemer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas Günther","surname":"Riemer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-Guang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michel","surname":"Burnier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michel","surname":"Burnier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"HFSA/ACC/AHA statement addresses concerns re:using RAAS antagonists in COVID-19.

with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute

Patients with Diabetes in a Retrospective Analysis","abstract":"Metformin was proposed to be a candidate for host-directed therapy for COVID-19. However, its efficacy remains to be validated.\n In this study, we compared the outcome of metformin users and nonusers in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes.\n Hospitalized diabetic patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the Tongji Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 27, 2020 to March 24, 2020, were grouped into metformin and no-metformin groups according to the diabetic medications used.\n The demographics, characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatments, and clinical outcome in these patients were retrospectively assessed.\n A total of 283 patients (104 in the metformin and 179 in the no-metformin group) were included in this study.\n There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, underlying diseases, clinical severity, and oxygen-support category at admission.\n The fasting blood glucose level of the metformin group was higher than that of the no-metformin group at admission and was under effective control in both groups after admission.\n Other laboratory parameters at admission and treatments after admission were not different between the two groups.\n The length of hospital stay did not differ between the two groups (21.0 days for metformin versus 19.5 days for no metformin, P = 0.74).\n However, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the metformin group (3/104 (2.9%) versus 22/179 (12.3%), P = 0.01).\n Antidiabetic treatment with metformin was associated with decreased mortality compared with diabetics not receiving metformin.\n This retrospective analysis suggests that metformin may offer benefits in patients with COVID-19 and that further study is indicated.\n","id":"PMC7356425","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pan","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiu-lan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-ling","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui-ying","surname":"Xue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

of the renin-angiotensin system, facilitator of amino acid transport, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 receptor.\n ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue.\n ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease.\n Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing.\n The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus.\n The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications.\n Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1–7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system.\n rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively.\n Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.\n","id":"PMC7188049","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mahmoud","surname":"Gheblawi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kaiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anissa","surname":"Viveiros","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Quynh","surname":"Nguyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiu-Chang","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anthony

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

(Review)","abstract":"id='P3'>The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway senses and responds to nutrient availability, energy sufficiency, stress, hormones and mitogens to modulate protein synthesis.\n Rapamycin is a bacterial product that can inhibit mTOR via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.\n mTOR signaling is necessary for the development of influenza and modulates the antibody response to provide cross-protective immunity to lethal infection with influenza virus.\n In one human study, it was found that the treatment of severe H1N1 influenza?related pneumonia with rapamycin and steroids improved the outcome.\n However, in other studies, immunosuppression with systemic steroids, and possibly rapamycin as well, was associated with an increased morbidity/mortality and a prolonged viral replication.\n In order to avoid the systemic side-effects, some investigators have postulated that the inhalation of rapamycin would be desirable.\n However, the inhalation of rapamycin, with its well-documented lung toxicity, could be contraindicated.\n Another class of drug, biguanides, can also inhibit mTOR, but have no lung toxicity.\n Biguanides are widely used small molecule drugs prescribed as oral anti-diabetics that have exhibited considerable promise in oncology.\n During the 1971 outbreak of influenza, diabetic patients treated with the biguanides, phenformin and buformin, had a lower incidence of infection than diabetics treated with sulfonylureas or insulin.\n Both buformin and phenformin reduce the mortality of influenza in mice; phenformin is less effective than buformin.\n The inhalation of buformin or phenformin for influenza may be an effective novel treatment strategy that would limit the risk of systemic side-effects associated with biguanides due to the low inhaled dose.\n Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus closely related to the SARS virus.\n The disease is the cause of the 2019–2020 coronavirus outbreak.\n It is primarily spread between individuals via small droplets emitted from infected individuals when breathing or coughing.\n PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling responses play important roles in MERS-CoV infection and may represent a novel drug target for therapeutic intervention strategies.\n The present review article discusses the effects of biguanides on influenza

elucidate the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance in SARS patients.\n The effect of clinical variables on survival was estimated in 135 SARS patients who died, 385 hospitalized SARS patients who

well-controlled blood glucose on the prognosis of individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes (T2D).\n Metformin is the most commonly prescribed first-line medication for T2D, but its impact on the outcomes of individuals with COVID-19 and T2D remains to be clarified.\n Our current retrospective study in a cohort of 1,213 hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D indicated that metformin use was significantly associated with a higher incidence of acidosis, particularly in cases with severe COVID-19, but not with 28-day COVID-19-related mortality.\n

in patients with severe covid-19.\nResearch design and methods\nIn this single-center, retrospective, observational study, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 193 patients with severe covid-19 were collected.\n\n 48 patients with severe covid-19 had diabetes, and 145 patients (ie, the controls) did not have diabetes.\n\n A severe case was defined as including at least one of the following criteria: (1) Respiratory rate &gt;30/min.\n\n (2) Oxygen saturation ?93%.\n\n (3) PaO2/FiO2?300?mm Hg.\n\n (4) Patients, either with shock or respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, or combined with other organ failure, requiring admission to intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n\nResults\nOf 193 patients with severe covid-19, 48 (24.9%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with patients with severe covid-19 without diabetes, patients with diabetes were older, susceptible to receiving mechanical ventilation and admission to ICU, and had higher mortality.\n\n In addition, patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes had higher levels of leukocyte count, neutrophil count, high-sensitivity C reaction protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, interleukin (IL) 2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor ?, D-dimer, fibrinogen, lactic dehydrogenase and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide.\n\n Among patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes, more non-survivors were men (30 (76.9%) vs 9 (23.1%)).\n\n Non-survivors had severe inflammatory response, and cardiac, hepatic, renal and coagulation impairment.\n\n Finally, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a trend towards poorer survival in patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes than patients without diabetes.\n\n The HR was 1.53 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.30; p=0.041) after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease by Cox regression.\n\n The median survival durations from hospital admission in patients with severe covid-19 with and without diabetes were 10 days and 18 days, respectively.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe mortality rate in patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes is considerable.\n\n Diabetes may lead to an increase in the risk of death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7222577","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yongli","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huihui","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shujun","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoli","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuefeng","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kun","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kun","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of

unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund Limited, Marina Man-Wai Lee, the Hong Kong Hainan Commercial Association South China Microbiology Research Fund, Sanming Project of Medicine (Shenzhen), and High Level-Hospital Program (Guangdong Health Commission).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159286","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper Fuk-Woo","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuofeng","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kin-Hang","surname":"Kok","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelvin Kai-Wang","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hin","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fanfan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jieling","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyril Chik-Yan","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosana Wing-Shan","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hoi-Wah","surname":"Tsoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon Kam-Fai","surname":"Lo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Kwok-Man","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan-Mui","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan Daniel","surname":"Ip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Piao","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Chi-Chung","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Honglin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher Kim-Ming","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

codes.\n\n Patients were divided into three groups depending on metformin use: CON (those not taking DM medication); N-MFOM (those taking DM medications other than metformin); and MFOM (those taking metformin for DM).\n\n Ultimately, 1865 patients were included; CON, N-MFOM and MFOM groups comprised 1301, 95 and 469 patients, respectively.\n\n\nResults\nKaplan–Meier analyses showed that MFOM patients had poorer survival rates than those in the CON group, but there were no significant differences in survival rates between MFOM and N-MFOM groups.\n\n Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed more favourable survival in CON than in N-MFOM patients, but there was no statistically significant difference in MFOM vs the other groups.\n\n Also, there were no significant differences in rates of use of inotropes, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, conventional oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal cannulas or mechanical ventilators, nor in the rates of acute kidney injury or cardiac events across all study groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nNo definite association could be found between metformin use and clinical outcomes, including survival.\n\n However, given the disproportionate participant numbers in our groups and small number of events, further studies are needed to determine whether the use of metformin has favourable or unfavourable effects in DM patients with COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7640920","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jun Young","surname":"Do","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sang

dapagliflozin have a protective effect against COVID-19 infection? A hypothesis","abstract":"It has been reported that frequent occurrence of COVID-19 infection in these patients is associated with low cytosolic pH.\n During virus infection, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level excessively rises.\n LDH is a cytosolic enzyme and the serum level increases as the cell break down.\n When anaerobic conditions develop, lactate formation increases from pyruvate.\n Cell pH is regulated by very complex mechanisms.\n When lactate increases in the extracellular area, this symporter carries lactate and H+ ion into the cell, and the intracellular pH quickly becomes acidic.\n Paradoxically, Na+/H+ exchanger activation takes place.\n While H+ ion is thrown out of the cell, Na+ and Ca+2 enter the cell.\n When Na+ and Ca+2 increase in the cell, the cells swell and die.\n Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor.\n Dapagliflozin has been reported to reduce lactate levels by various mechanisms.\n Also, it reduces oxygen consumption in tissues and causes the use of glucose in the aerobic pathway, thereby reducing lactate production.\n A lactate decrease in the environment reduces the activation of lactate/H+ symporter.\n Thus, the H ion pumping into the cell by this symporter is reduced and the cytosolic pH is maintained.\n Dapagliflozin also directly inhibits NHE.\n Thus, Na+ and Ca+2 flow to the cell are inhibited.\n Dapagliflozin provides the continuation of the structure and functions of the cells.\n Dapagliflozin can prevent the severe course of COVID-19 infection by preventing the lowering of cytosolic pH and reducing the viral load.\n","id":"PMC7195078","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Erkan","surname":"Cure","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Medine","surname":"Cumhur

China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David

impact on the outcomes of individuals with COVID-19 and T2D remains to be clarified.\n\n Our current retrospective study in a cohort of 1,213 hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D indicated that metformin use was significantly associated with a higher incidence of acidosis, particularly in cases with severe COVID-19, but not with 28-day COVID-19-related mortality.\n\n Furthermore, metformin use was significantly associated with reduced heart failure and inflammation.\n\n Our findings provide clinical evidence in support of continuing metformin treatment in individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D, but acidosis and kidney function should be carefully monitored in individuals with severe

Depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and Is Blocked by a Clinically Proven Protease Inhibitor","abstract":"The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency.\n Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases.\n Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets.\n Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.\n A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option.\n Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.\n Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV

system and sedentariness are major determinants in the severity of influenza viral infection in obese patients.\n\n Being overweight not only increases the risk of infection and of complications for the single obese person, but a large prevalence of obese individuals within the population might increase the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout the total population and eventually might increase overall mortality rate of an influenza pandemic.\n\n\nResults\nWaiting for the development of a vaccination against COVID-19, isolation of positive cases and social distancing are the primary interventions.\n\n Nonetheless, evidence from previous influenza pandemics suggests the following interventions aimed at improving immune response: (1) lose weight with a mild caloric restriction; (2) include AMPK activators and PPAR gamma activators in the drug treatment for obesity associated with diabetes; and (3) practice mild-to-moderate physical exercise.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par1'>Due to prolonged viral shedding, quarantine in obese subjects should likely be longer than normal weight

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

diabetes (T2D) since it specifically reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis without increasing insulin secretion, inducing weight gain, or posing a risk of hypoglycemia1,2.\n For over half a century, this agent has been prescribed to T2D patients worldwide, yet the underlying mechanism by which metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis remains unknown.\n Here we show that metformin non-competitively inhibits the redox shuttle enzyme mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD), resulting in an altered hepatocellular redox state, reduced conversion of lactate and glycerol to glucose, and decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis.\n Acute and chronic low-dose metformin treatment effectively reduced endogenous glucose production (EGP), while increasing cytosolic redox and decreasing mitochondrial redox states.\n Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) knockdown of hepatic mGPD in rats resulted in a phenotype akin to chronic metformin treatment, and abrogated metformin-mediated increases in cytosolic redox state, decrease in plasma glucose concentrations and inhibition of EGP.\n These findings were replicated in whole-body mGPD knockout mice.\n These results have significant

of metformin-induced lactic acidosis.\n\n However, patients with severe metformin intoxication may have a 30 to 60% decrease in their global oxygen consumption, as for generalized inhibition of mitochondrial respiration.\n\n We developed a pig model of severe metformin intoxication to validate this clinical finding and assess mitochondrial function in liver and other tissues.\n\n\nMethods\nTwenty healthy pigs were sedated and mechanically ventilated.\n\n Ten were infused with a large dose of metformin (4 to 8 g) and five were not (sham controls).\n\n Five others were infused with lactic acid to clarify whether lactic acidosis per se diminishes global oxygen use.\n\n Arterial pH, lactatemia, global oxygen consumption (VO2) (metabolic module) and delivery (DO2) (cardiac output by thermodilution) were monitored for nine hours.\n\n Oxygen extraction was computed as VO2/DO2.\n\n Activities of the main components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I, II and III, and IV) were measured with spectrophotometry (and expressed relative to citrate synthase activity) in heart, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle and platelets taken at the end of the study.\n\n\nResults\nPigs infused with metformin (6 ± 2 g; final serum drug level 77 ± 45 mg/L) progressively developed lactic acidosis (final arterial pH 6.93 ± 0.24 and lactate 18 ± 7 mmol/L, P &lt; 0.001 for both).\n\n Their VO2 declined over time (from 115 ± 34 to 71 ± 30 ml/min, P &lt; 0.001) despite grossly preserved DO2 (from 269 ± 68 to 239 ± 51 ml/min, P = 0.58).\n\n Oxygen extraction accordingly fell from 43 ± 10 to 30 ± 10% (P = 0.008).\n\n None of these changes occurred in either sham controls or pigs infused with lactic acid (final arterial pH 6.86 ± 0.16 and lactate 22 ± 3 mmol/L).\n\n Metformin intoxication was associated with inhibition of complex I in the liver (P &lt; 0.001), heart (P &lt; 0.001), kidney (P = 0.003), skeletal muscle (P = 0.012) and platelets (P =

metformin, an old and widely accepted first line agent, stands out not only for its antihyperglycemic properties but also for its effects beyond glycemic control such as improvements in endothelial dysfunction, hemostasis and oxidative stress, insulin resistance, lipid profiles, and fat redistribution.\n These properties may have contributed to the decrease of adverse cardiovascular outcomes otherwise not attributable to metformin’s mere antihyperglycemic effects.\n Several other classes of oral antidiabetic agents have been recently launched, introducing the need to evaluate the role of

metformin in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and describe the additional benefits beyond its glycemic effect.\n We also discuss its potential role for a variety of insulin resistant and

actions within the gut.\n It increases intestinal glucose uptake and lactate production, increases GLP-1 concentrations and the bile acid pool within the intestine, and alters the microbiome.\n A novel delayed-release preparation of metformin has recently been shown to improve glycaemic control to a similar extent to immediate-release metformin, but with less systemic exposure.\n We believe

gene expression and protein levels of OCT-1 and OCT-2 in adipose tissue and during adipogenesis and evaluated their possible role in metformin action on adipocytes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nOCT1 and OCT2 gene expressions were analyzed in 118 adipose tissue samples (57 visceral and 61 subcutaneous depots) and during human preadipocyte differentiation.\n\n To test the possible role of OCT1 mediating the response of adipocytes to metformin, cotreatments with cimetidine (OCT blocker, 0.5 and 5 mmol/l) and metformin were made on human preadipocytes and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOCT1 gene was expressed in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue.\n\n In both fat depots, OCT1 gene expression and protein levels were significantly increased in obese subjects.\n\n OCT1 gene expression in isolated preadipocytes significantly increased during differentiation in parallel to adipogenic genes.\n\n Metformin (5 mmol/l) decreased the expression of lipogenic genes and lipid droplets accumulation while increasing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, preventing differentiation of human preadipocytes.\n\n Cotreatment with cimetidine restored adipogenesis.\n\n Furthermore, metformin decreased IL-6 and MCP-1 gene expression in comparison with differentiated adipocytes.\n\n Metformin (0.1 and 1 mmol/l) decreased adipogenic and inflammatory genes in SAT.\n\n OCT2 gene expression was not detected in adipose tissue and was very small in isolated preadipocytes, disappearing during adipogenesis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOCT1 gene expression and protein levels are detectable in adipose tissue.\n\n Increased OCT1 gene expression in adipose tissue of obese subjects might contribute to increased metformin action in these

However, little information exists comparing it with acarbose which is also commonly used in China.\n\n This study expanded knowledge by combining direct and indirect evidence to ascertain the glucose lowering effects of both drugs.\n\n\nMethods\nPubMed (1980- December 2013) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases (1994-January 2014) were systematically searched for eligible randomized controlled trials from Chinese and English literatures.\n\n Meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the glucose lowering effects of metformin vs.\n\n acarbose, or either of them vs.\n\n common comparators (placebo or sulphonylureas), using random- and fixed-effect models.\n\n Bucher method with indirect treatment comparison calculator was applied to convert the summary estimates from the meta-analyses into weighted-mean-difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to represent the comparative efficacy between metformin and acarbose.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 75 studies were included in the analysis.\n\n In direct comparison (8 trials), metformin reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.06% more than acarbose, with no significant difference (WMD,-0.06%; 95% CI, -0.32% to 0.20%).\n\n In indirect comparisons (67 trials), by using placebo and sulphonylureas as common comparators, metformin achieved significant HbA1c reduction than acarbose, by -0.38% (WMD,-0.38%, 95% CI, -0.736% to -0.024%) and -0.34% (WMD, -0.34%, 95% CI, -0.651% to -0.029%) respectively.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe glucose lowering effects of metformin monotherapy and acarbose monotherapy are the same by direct comparison, while metformin is a little better by indirect comparison.\n\n This implies that the effect of metformin is at least as good as acarbose's.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4427275","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shuyan","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jihao","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhiliu","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Monika","surname":"Sawhney","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huimei","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lizheng","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vivian","surname":"Fonseca","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hengjin","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.2337/diacare.24.3.489","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effect

Protection of the Endothelium","abstract":"The anti-diabetic and oral hypoglycaemic agent metformin, first used clinically in 1958, is today the first choice or ‘gold standard’ drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovary disease.\n Of particular importance for the treatment of diabetes, metformin affords protection against diabetes-induced vascular disease.\n In addition, retrospective analyses suggest that treatment with metformin provides therapeutic benefits to patients with several forms of cancer.\n Despite almost 60 years of clinical use, the precise cellular mode(s) of action of metformin remains controversial.\n A direct or indirect role of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the fuel gauge of the cell, has been inferred in many studies, with evidence that activation of AMPK may result from a mild inhibitory effect of metformin on mitochondrial complex 1, which in turn would raise AMP and activate AMPK.\n Discrepancies, however, between the concentrations of metformin used in in vitro studies versus therapeutic levels suggest that caution should be applied before extending inferences derived from cell-based studies to therapeutic benefits seen in patients.\n Conceivably, the effects, or some of them, may be at least partially independent of AMPK and/or mitochondrial respiration and reflect a direct effect of either metformin or a minor and, as yet, unidentified putative metabolite of metformin on a target protein(s)/signalling cascade.\n In this review, we critically evaluate the data from studies that have investigated the pharmacokinetic properties and the cellular and clinical basis for the oral hypoglycaemic, insulin-sensitising and vascular protective effects of

arrhythmias.\n\n In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, structural and functional alterations of the left ventricle (LV) are highly prevalent, however, little is known about the impact of diabetes on RV characteristics.\n\n The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether LV changes are paralleled by RV alterations in a rat model of diabetes.\n\n\nMethods\nZucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) and control (ZL) rats underwent echocardiography and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning using [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose under hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp conditions.\n\n Glucose, insulin, triglycerides and fatty acids were assessed from trunk blood.\n\n Another group of rats received an insulin or saline injection to study RV insulin signaling.\n\n\nResults\nZDF rats developed hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and dyslipidaemia (all p &lt; 0.05).\n\n Echocardiography revealed depressed LV fractional shortening and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) in ZDF vs.\n\n ZL rats (both p &lt; 0.05).\n\n A decrease in LV and RV insulin-mediated glucose utilisation was found in ZDF vs.\n\n ZL rats (both p &lt; 0.05).\n\n LV associated with RV with respect to systolic function (r = 0.86, p &lt; 0.05) and glucose utilisation (r = 0.74, p &lt; 0.05).\n\n TAPSE associated with RV MRglu (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.05) and M-value (r = 0.91, p &lt; 0.0001) and RV MRglu associated with M-value (r = 0.77, p &lt; 0.05).\n\n Finally, reduced RV insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt was found in ZDF vs.\n\n ZL (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n\nConclusions\nLV changes were paralleled by RV alterations in insulin-stimulated glucose utilisation and RV systolic function in a rat model of diabetes, which may be attributed to ventricular interdependence as well as to the uniform effect of diabetes.\n\n Since diabetic patients are prone to develop diabetic cardiomyopathy and myocardial ischaemia, it might be suggested that RV dysfunction plays a central role in cardiac

not only to regenerate ATP for contraction but also to sustain biosynthetic reactions for replacement of cellular building blocks.\n Metabolic pathways also control intracellular redox state, and metabolic intermediates and end products provide signals that prompt changes in enzymatic activity and gene expression.\n Mounting evidence suggests that the changes in cardiac metabolism that occur during development, exercise, and pregnancy as well as with pathological stress (eg, myocardial infarction, pressure overload) are causative in cardiac remodeling.\n Metabolism-mediated changes in gene expression, metabolite signaling, and the channeling of glucose-derived carbon toward anabolic pathways seem critical for physiological growth of the heart, and metabolic inefficiency and loss of coordinated anabolic activity are emerging as proximal causes of pathological remodeling.\n This review integrates knowledge of different forms of cardiac remodeling to develop general models of how relationships between catabolic and anabolic glucose metabolism may fortify cardiac health or promote (mal)adaptive myocardial remodeling.\n Adoption of conceptual frameworks based in relational

capacity and cardiovascular function.\n The accumulation of epigenetic changes also plays important roles in the development of CVDs.\n In summary, the understanding of the aging-mediated changes remains promising towards effective diagnosis, discovery of new drug targets, and development of new therapies for the treatment of CVDs.\n","id":"PMC6015721","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"James

process is divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination.\n Initiation is the step at which the ribosome is recruited to the mRNA, and is regarded as the major rate-limiting step in translation, while elongation consists of the elongation of the polypeptide chain; both steps are frequent targets for regulation, which is defined as a change in the rate of translation of an mRNA per unit time.\n In the normal brain, control of translation is a key mechanism for regulation of memory and synaptic plasticity consolidation, i.\ne.\n, the off-line processing of acquired information.\n These regulation processes may differ between different brain structures or neuronal populations.\n Moreover, dysregulation of translation leads to pathological brain function such as memory impairment.\n Both normal and abnormal function of the translation machinery is believed to lead to translational up-regulation or down-regulation of a subset of mRNAs.\n However, the identification of these newly synthesized proteins and determination of the rates of protein synthesis or degradation taking place in different neuronal types and compartments at different time points in the brain demand new proteomic methods and system biology approaches.\n Here, we discuss in detail the relationship between translation regulation and memory or synaptic plasticity consolidation

for health care systems.\n Therefore, and to counteract the continually increasing prevalence of diabetes, understanding the pathogenesis, the main risk factors, and the underlying molecular

electrocardiographic changes in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction.\n\n\nMethods\nMale Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups of control, isoproterenol alone, tacrolimus alone, and isoproterenol plus tacrolimus (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg).\n\n Isoproterenol (100 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously for two consecutive days to induce myocardial infarction, and simultaneously tacrolimus was administered orally twice a day for three days.\n\n\nResults and conclusions\nAdministration of isoproterenol resulted in myocardial edema and necrosis as well as a marked reduction in the left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular contractility (LVdP/dtmax) and relaxation (LVdP/dtmin) along with a severe elevation in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).\n\n Isoproterenol also elevated the ST-segment and suppressed the R-amplitude and R-R interval on ECG.\n\n It was found that all doses of tacrolimus could amend the ECG pattern and ameliorated the isoproterenol induced disturbances in cardiac function.\n\n Acute and short term treatment with tacrolimus at dose of 2 mg/kg significantly (P?&lt;?0.001) improved LVdP/dtmax from 2712?±?82 in myocardial infarcted rats to 4592?±?149 mmHg/sec.\n\n Similarly, tacrolimus lowered LVEDP from 17.6?±?0.68 in MI group to the value of 5.6?±?0.22 mmHg (P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Furthermore, tacrolimus was found to reduce malondialdehyde concentration in serum and myocardium by 50-70%

RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth,

exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of

patients with obstructive colorectal cancer","abstract":"BACKGROUND\nObstructive colorectal cancer (OCC) is always accompanied by severe complications, and the optimal strategy for patients with OCC remains undetermined.\n\n Different from emergency surgery (ES), self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) as a bridge to surgery (BTS), could increase the likelihood of primary anastomosis.\n\n However, the stent failure and related complications might give rise to a high recurrence rate.\n\n Few studies have focused on the indications for either method, and the relationship between preoperative inflammation indexes and the prognosis of OCC is still underestimated.\n\n\nAIM\nTo explore the indications for ES and BTS in OCCs based on preoperative inflammation indexes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred and twenty-eight patients who underwent ES or BTS from 2008 to 2015 were enrolled.\n\n Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to define the optimal preoperative inflammation index and its cutoff point.\n\n Kaplan–Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models were applied to assess the association between the preoperative inflammation indexes and the survival outcomes [overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)].\n\n Stratification analysis was performed to identify the subgroups that would benefit from ES or BTS.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOS and DFS were comparable between the ES and BTS groups (P &gt; 0.05).\n\n ROC curve analysis showed derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) as the optimal biomarker for the prediction of DFS in ES (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n Lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) was recommended for BTS with regard to OS and DFS (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n dNLR was related to stoma construction (P = 0.001), pneumonia (P = 0.054), and DFS (P = 0.009) in ES.\n\n LMR was closely related to lymph node invasion (LVI) (P = 0.009), OS (P = 0.020), and DFS (P = 0.046) in the BTS group.\n\n dNLR was an independent risk factor for ES in both OS (P = 0.032) and DFS (P = 0.016).\n\n LMR affected OS (P = 0.053) and DFS (P = 0.052) in the BTS group.\n\n LMR could differentiate the OS between the ES and BTS groups (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPreoperative dNLR and LMR could predict OS and DFS in patients undergoing ES and BTS, respectively.\n\n For OCC, as the potential benefit group, patients with a low LMR might be preferred for BTS via SEMS insertion.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6737316","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xian-Qiang","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chao-Rong","surname":"Xue","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Hou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bing-Qiang","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jun-Rong","surname":"Zhang","email":"junrongzhang@fjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk

limited medical resources.\n The present study aimed to analyze the characteristics of severe COVID?19 and identify biomarkers for differential diagnosis and prognosis prediction.\n In total, 27 consecutive patients with COVID?19 and 75 patients with flu were retrospectively enrolled.\n Clinical parameters were collected from electronic medical records.\n The disease course was divided into four stages: initial, progression, peak, and recovery stages, according to computed tomography (CT) progress.\n to mild COVID?19, the lymphocytes in the severe COVID?19 progressively decreased at the progression and the peak stages, but rebound in the recovery stage.\n The levels of C?reactive protein (CRP) in the severe group at the initial and progression stages were higher than those in the mild group.\n Correlation analysis showed that CRP (R?=?.\n62; P?&lt;?.\n01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (R?=?.\n55; P?&lt;?.\n01) and granulocyte/lymphocyte ratio (R?=?.\n49; P?&lt;?.\n01) were positively associated with the CT severity scores.\n In contrast, the number of lymphocytes (R?=??.\n37; P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating

clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients","abstract":"Background:\nA patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta.\n\n The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear.\n\n This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively.\n\n The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients’ oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed.\n\n Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs.\n\n The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.\n\n\nResults:\nIn the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study.\n\n In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0–62.0) years were analyzed.\n\n After in-hospital treatment, patients’ inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition.\n\n The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0–11.0) days.\n\n By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients’ stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0–16.0) days after symptom onset.\n\n Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0–4.0) days.\n\n Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients’ urine specimens after throat swabs were negative.\n\n Using a multiple linear regression model (F?=?2.669, P?=?0.044, and adjusted R2?=?0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients’ stools (t?=??2.699, P?=?0.010).\n\n The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs.\n\n 8.0 days, respectively; t?=?2.550, P?=?0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs.\n\n 11 days, respectively; t?=?4.631, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P?&gt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions:\nIn brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients’ stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence.\n\n Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease.\n\n The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shui-Bao","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-Xiao","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Di","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Qin","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bi-Jie","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"En-Qiang","surname":"Mao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-Hong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong-Zhou","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Genomic

I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells.\n Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung.\n SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry.\n To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins.\n Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules.\n Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP.\n Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs.\n We also conducted “CellPhoneDB” analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues.\n We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.\n","id":"PMC7156119","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Furong","surname":"Qi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shen","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuye","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"NIH

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU

management algorithms and guidelines after the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) showed cardiovascular mortality benefits in the overweight population using metformin.\n However, the improved Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) realised in some of the recent large cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) using sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like

target atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and improving glycaemic control as a secondary aim.\n In this review article, we will revisit the major cardiovascular outcome data for metformin and include a critique of the UKPDS data.\n We then review additional factors that might be pertinent to metformin’s status as a first-line agent and finally answer key questions when considering

Infrastructure (VINCI) was utilized to obtain individual-level information on demographics, administrative claims, and pharmacy dispensation.\n A cohort was created among individuals with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of influenza with a diagnosis of fever, cough, influenza, or acute upper respiratory infection in an outpatient setting.\n The study outcome was death after diagnosis of influenza.\n Cohorts were formed using diabetes status and metformin exposure prior to a positive influenza diagnosis.\n Hazard ratios for mortality were estimated using a cox proportional hazards

controls and non-diabetic controls to diabetic patients receiving metformin.\n Results: A total of 3551 patients met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated in our study.\n The cohorts consisted of 1461 patients in the non-diabetic cohort, 1597 patients in the diabetic / metformin cohort, and 493 patients in the diabetic no metformin cohort.\n Compared to non-diabetic patients, diabetic patients

effects1–4.\n For clinical doses of metformin, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a major role in its mechanism of action4,5; however, the direct molecular target of metformin remains unknown.\n Here we show that clinically relevant concentrations of metformin inhibit the lysosomal proton pump v-ATPase, which is a central node for AMPK activation following glucose starvation6.\n We synthesize a photoactive metformin probe and identify PEN2, a subunit of ?-secretase7, as a binding partner of metformin with a dissociation constant at micromolar levels.\n Metformin-bound PEN2 forms a complex with ATP6AP1, a subunit of the v-ATPase8, which leads to the inhibition of v-ATPase and the activation of AMPK without effects on cellular AMP levels.\n Knockout of PEN2 or re-introduction of a PEN2 mutant that does not bind ATP6AP1 blunts AMPK activation.\n In vivo, liver-specific knockout of Pen2 abolishes metformin-mediated reduction of hepatic fat content, whereas intestine-specific knockout of Pen2 impairs its glucose-lowering effects.\n Furthermore, knockdown of pen-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans abrogates metformin-induced extension of lifespan.\n Together, these findings reveal that metformin binds PEN2 and initiates a signalling route that intersects, through ATP6AP1, the lysosomal glucose-sensing pathway for AMPK activation.\n This ensures that metformin exerts its therapeutic

that MET transiently reduced the apical density of sodium-glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and decreased the absorption of glucose, without changes in the mRNA levels of the transporter.\n Administered 1 h before a glucose challenge in rats (Wistar, GK), C57BL6 mice and mice pigs, oral MET reduced the post-prandial glucose response (PGR).\n This effect was abrogated in SGLT1-KO mice.\n MET also

in enterocyte plasma membranes.\n\n Loss of insulin action maintains apical GLUT2 location.\n\n In human enterocytes, apical GLUT2 location has not been reported but may be revealed under conditions of insulin resistance.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nSubcellular location of GLUT2 in jejunal enterocytes was analyzed by confocal and electron microscopy imaging and Western blot in 62 well-phenotyped morbidly obese subjects and 7 lean human subjects.\n\n GLUT2 locations were assayed in ob/ob and ob/+ mice receiving oral metformin or in high-fat low-carbohydrate diet–fed C57Bl/6 mice.\n\n Glucose absorption and secretion were respectively estimated by oral glucose tolerance test and secretion of [U-14C]-3-O-methyl glucose into lumen.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn human enterocytes, GLUT2 was consistently located in basolateral membranes.\n\n Apical GLUT2 location was absent in lean subjects but was observed in 76% of obese subjects and correlated with insulin resistance and glycemia.\n\n In addition, intracellular accumulation of GLUT2 with early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) was associated with reduced MGAT4a activity (glycosylation) in 39% of obese subjects on a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet.\n\n Mice on a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet for 12 months also exhibited endosomal GLUT2 accumulation and reduced glucose absorption.\n\n In ob/ob mice, metformin promoted apical GLUT2 and improved glucose homeostasis.\n\n Apical GLUT2 in fasting hyperglycemic ob/ob mice tripled glucose release into intestinal lumen.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn morbidly obese insulin-resistant subjects, GLUT2 was accumulated in apical and/or endosomal membranes of enterocytes.\n\n Functionally, apical GLUT2 favored and endosomal GLUT2 reduced glucose transepithelial

anticancer properties.\n However, in experiments performed with isolated cells, authors have reported both pro- and anti-apoptotic effects of metformin.\n The exact molecular mechanism of action of metformin remains partly unknown despite its use for over 60 years and more than 17,000 articles in PubMed.\n Among the various widely recognized or recently proposed targets, it has been reported consistently that metformin is capable of inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory chain Complex I.\n Since most of the effects of metformin have been replicated by other inhibitors of Complex I, it has been suggested that the mechanism of action of metformin involved the inhibition of Complex I.\n However, compared to conventional Complex I inhibitors, the metformin-induced inhibition of Complex I has unique characteristics.\n Among these, the most original one is that the concentrations of metformin required to inhibit Complex I are lower in intact cells than in isolated mitochondria.\n Experiments with isolated mitochondria or Complex I were generally performed using millimolar concentrations of metformin, while plasma levels remain in the micromolar range in both human and animal studies, highlighting that metformin concentration is an important issue.\n In order to explain the effects in animals based on observations in cells and mitochondria, some authors proposed a direct effect of the drug on Complex I involving an accumulation of metformin inside the mitochondria while others proposed an indirect effect (the drug no longer having to diffuse into the mitochondria).\n This brief review attempts to: gather arguments for and against each hypothesis concerning the mechanism by which metformin inhibits Complex I and to highlight remaining questions about the toxicity mechanism of metformin for certain cancer

the lumen through the paracellular space, and rupture of its integrity is associated with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders and extra-digestive diseases.\n\n Increased IEB permeability has been linked to disruption of metabolic homeostasis leading to obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\n Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered compelling evidence that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway plays an important role in maintaining epithelial cell barrier function.\n\n However, our understanding of the function of intestinal AMPK in regulating IEB and glucose homeostasis remains sparse.\n\n\nMethods\nWe generated mice lacking the two ?1 and ?2 AMPK catalytic subunits specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC AMPK KO) and determined the physiological consequences of intestinal-specific deletion of AMPK in response to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity.\n\n We combined histological, functional, and integrative analyses to ascertain the effects of gut AMPK loss on intestinal permeability in vivo and ex vivo and on the development of obesity and metabolic dysfunction.\n\n We also determined the impact of intestinal AMPK deletion in an inducible mouse model (i-IEC AMPK KO) by measuring IEB function, glucose homeostasis, and the composition of gut microbiota via fecal 16S rRNA sequencing.\n\n\nResults\nWhile there were no differences in in vivo intestinal permeability in WT and IEC AMPK KO mice, ex vivo transcellular and paracellular permeability measured in Ussing chambers was significantly increased in the distal colon of IEC AMPK KO mice.\n\n This was associated with a reduction in pSer425 GIV phosphorylation, a marker of leaky gut barrier.\n\n However, the expression of tight junction proteins in intestinal epithelial cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lamina propria were not different between genotypes.\n\n Although the HFD-fed AMPK KO mice displayed suppression of the stress polarity signaling pathway and a concomitant increase in colon permeability, loss of intestinal AMPK did not exacerbate body weight gain or adiposity.\n\n Deletion of AMPK was also not sufficient to alter glucose homeostasis or the acute glucose-lowering action of metformin in control diet (CD)- or HFD-fed mice.\n\n CD-fed i-IEC AMPK KO mice also presented higher permeability in the distal colon under homeostatic conditions but, surprisingly, this was not detected upon HFD feeding.\n\n Alteration in epithelial barrier function in the i-IEC AMPK KO mice was associated with a shift in the gut microbiota composition with higher levels of Clostridiales and Desulfovibrionales.\n\n\nConclusions\nAltogether, our results revealed a significant role of intestinal AMPK in maintaining IEB integrity in the distal colon but not in

non–alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes.\n AMP–activated protein kinase (Ampk) regulates energy homeostasis and is activated by cellular stress, hormones and the widely prescribed anti–type 2 diabetic drug metformin1,2.\n Ampk phosphorylates murine acetyl–CoA carboxylase3,4 (Acc) 1 at Ser79 and Acc2 at Ser212, inhibiting the conversion of acetyl–CoA to malonyl–CoA, a precursor in fatty acid synthesis5 as well as an allosteric inhibitor of fatty acid transport into mitochondria for oxidation6.\n To test the physiological impact of these phosphorylation events we generated mice with alanine knock–in mutations in both Acc1 (Ser79) and Acc2 (Ser212) (Acc double knock–in, AccDKI).\n These mice have elevated lipogenesis and lower fatty acid oxidation compared to wild–type (WT) mice, which contribute to the progression of insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and NAFLD, but not obesity.\n Remarkably, AccDKI mice made obese by high–fat feeding, are refractory to the lipid–lowering and insulin–sensitizing effects of metformin.\n These findings establish that inhibitory phosphorylation of Acc by Ampk is essential for the control of lipid metabolism, and in

While metformin has been shown to have pleotropic effects on glucose metabolism, there is a general consensus that the major glucose-lowering effect in patients with type 2 diabetes is mostly mediated through inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis.\n However, despite decades of research, the mechanism by which metformin inhibits this process is still highly debated.\n A key reason for these discrepant effects is likely due to the inconsistency in dosage of metformin across studies.\n Widely studied mechanisms of action, such as complex I inhibition leading to AMPK activation, have only been observed in the context of supra-pharmacological (&gt;1 mM) metformin concentrations, which do not occur in the clinical setting.\n Thus, these mechanisms have been challenged in recent years and new mechanisms have been proposed.\n Based on the observation that metformin alters cellular redox balance, a redox-dependent mechanism of action has been described by several groups.\n Recent studies have shown that clinically relevant (50-100 ?M) concentrations of metformin inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis in a substrate-selective manner both in vitro and in vivo, supporting a redox-dependent

a systematic review of published and unpublished studies evaluating the comparative effectiveness and harms of diabetes medications for the treatment of NAFLD.\n\n We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE,

Here, we show that clinically-relevant plasma metformin concentrations achieved by acute intravenous, acute intraportal or chronic oral administration in awake normal and diabetic rats inhibit

constitutively active acetyl-CoA carboxylase, metformin acutely decreased hepatic glucose production and increased the hepatic cytosolic redox state without altering hepatic triglyceride content or gluconeogenic enzyme expression.\n These studies demonstrate that metformin, at clinically-relevant plasma concentrations, inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis in a redox-dependent manner independent of

macrovascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\n\n These effects have been ascribed to adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in the liver and skeletal muscle.\n\n However, metformin effects are not attenuated when AMPK is knocked out and intravenous metformin is less effective than oral medication, raising the possibility of important gut pharmacology.\n\n We hypothesized that the pharmacology of metformin includes alteration of bile acid recirculation and gut microbiota resulting in enhanced enteroendocrine hormone secretion.\n\n In this study we evaluated T2DM subjects on and off metformin monotherapy to characterize the gut-based mechanisms of metformin.\n\n Subjects were studied at 4 time points: (i) at baseline on metformin, (ii) 7 days after stopping metformin, (iii) when fasting blood glucose (FBG) had risen by 25% after stopping metformin, and (iv) when FBG returned to baseline levels after restarting the metformin.\n\n At these timepoints we profiled glucose, insulin, gut hormones (glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and bile acids in blood, as well as duodenal and faecal bile acids and gut microbiota.\n\n We found that metformin withdrawal was associated with a reduction of active and total GLP-1 and elevation of serum bile acids, especially cholic acid and its conjugates.\n\n These effects reversed when metformin was restarted.\n\n Effects on circulating PYY were more modest, while GIP changes were negligible.\n\n Microbiota abundance of the phylum Firmicutes was positively correlated with changes in cholic acid and conjugates, while Bacteroidetes abundance was negatively correlated.\n\n Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes representation were also correlated with levels of serum PYY.\n\n Our study suggests that metformin has complex effects due to gut-based pharmacology which might provide

cancer treatment and randomized them (n = 121) to either 1) metformin (up to 2,000 mg), 2) coach-directed behavioral weight loss, or 3) self-directed care (control) for 12 months.\n\n We collected

microbiota, the differences between species, the large variation between individuals, and the differences in experimental design, bringing great obstacle for our better understanding of the effects of metformin on the gut microbiota.\n Here, we reviewed the published papers concerning about the impacts of metformin on the gut microbiota of mice, rats, and humans with obesity or T2DM, and summarized the changes of gut microbiota composition caused by metformin and the possible underlying hypoglycemic mechanism which is related to gut microbiota.\n It was found that the proportions of some microbiota, such as phyla Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia and genera Akkermansia, Bacteroides and Escherichia, were significantly affected by metformin in several studies.\n Metformin may exert part

of the present study is to examine the compositional and functional potential of the gut microbiota across individuals from Denmark and South India with a focus on T2D.\n\n Many earlier studies have investigated the microbiome aspects of T2D, and it has also been anticipated that such microbial associations would be dependent on diet and ethnic origin.\n\n However, there has been no large scale trans-ethnic microbiome study earlier in this direction aimed at evaluating any “universal” microbiome signature of T2D.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing was

factorial study design, and including 24 experimental units allocated to 8 treatment groups to systematically evaluate the effect of sex and metabolic status on metformin interaction with microbiome.\n We used DNA obtained from fecal samples representing gut microbiome before and after ten weeks-long metformin treatment.\n We identified 100 metformin-related differentially abundant species in high-fat diet-fed mice before and after the treatment, with most of the species relative abundances increased.\n In contrast, no significant changes were observed in control diet-fed mice.\n Functional analysis targeted to carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism pathways revealed 14 significantly altered hierarchies.\n We also observed sex-specific differences in response to metformin treatment.\n Males experienced more pronounced changes in metabolic markers, while in females the extent of changes in gut microbiome representatives was more marked, indicated by 53

reductions in tumor growth involves modulation of the gut microbiome<","abstract":"Background/Purpose\nType 2 diabetes and obesity increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer.\n\n Metformin may reduce colorectal cancer but the mechanisms mediating this effect remain unclear.\n\n In mice and humans, a high-fat diet (HFD), obesity and metformin are known to alter the gut microbiome but whether this is important for influencing tumor growth is not known.\n\n\nMethods\nMice with syngeneic MC38 colon adenocarcinomas were treated with metformin or feces obtained from control or metformin treated mice.\n\n\nResults\nWe find that compared to chow-fed controls, tumor growth is increased when mice are fed a HFD and that this acceleration of tumor growth can be partially recapitulated through transfer of the fecal microbiome or in vitro treatment of cells with fecal filtrates from HFD-fed animals.\n\n Treatment of HFD-fed mice with orally ingested, but not intraperitoneally injected, metformin suppresses tumor growth and increases the expression of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing microbes Alistipes, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae.\n\n The transfer of the gut microbiome from mice treated orally with metformin to drug naïve, conventionalized HFD-fed mice increases circulating propionate and butyrate, reduces tumor proliferation, and suppresses the expression of sterol response element binding protein (SREBP) gene targets in the tumor.\n\n\nConclusion\nThese data indicate that in obese mice fed a HFD, metformin reduces tumor burden through

metformin by gavage (300 mg/day/kg body weight) during the HFS diet.\n Metformin counteracted HFS diet-induced overexpression of a network of genes involved in the transport of glucose and fatty acids

enhances fasting and postprandial GLP-1 and PYY: results from two randomised trials","abstract":"Aims/hypothesis\nDelayed-release metformin (Metformin DR) was developed to maximise gut-based mechanisms of metformin action by targeting the drug to the ileum.\n\n Metformin DR was evaluated in two studies.\n\n Study 1 compared the bioavailability and effects on circulating glucose and gut hormones (glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY) of Metformin DR dosed twice-daily to twice-daily immediate-release metformin (Metformin IR).\n\n Study 2 compared the bioavailability and glycaemic effects of Metformin DR dosages of 1,000 mg once-daily in the morning, 1,000 mg once-daily in the evening, and 500 mg twice-daily.\n\n\nMethods\nStudy 1 was a blinded, randomised, crossover study (three × 5 day treatment periods) of twice-daily 500 mg or 1,000 mg Metformin DR vs twice-daily 1,000 mg Metformin IR in 24 participants with type 2 diabetes conducted at two study sites (Celerion Inc.\n\n; Tempe, AZ, and Lincoln, NE, USA).\n\n Plasma glucose and gut hormones were assessed over 10.25 h at the start and end of each treatment period; plasma metformin was measured over 11 h at the end of each treatment period.\n\n Study 2 was a non-blinded, randomised, crossover study (three × 7 day treatment periods) of 1,000 mg Metformin DR once-daily in the morning, 1,000 mg Metformin DR once-daily in the evening, or 500 mg Metformin DR twice-daily in 26 participants with type 2 diabetes performed at a single study site (Celerion, Tempe, AZ).\n\n Plasma glucose was assessed over 24 h at the start and end of each treatment period, and plasma metformin was measured over 30 h at the end of each treatment period.\n\n Both studies implemented centrally generated computer-based randomisation using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 24 randomised participants were included in study 1; of these, 19 completed the study and were included in the evaluable population.\n\n In the evaluable population, all treatments produced similar significant reductions in fasting glucose (median reduction range, ?0.67 to ?0.81 mmol/l across treatments) and postprandial glucose (Day 5 to baseline AUC0–t ratio?=?0.9 for all three treatments) and increases in gut hormones (Day 5 to baseline AUC0–t ratio range: 1.6–1.9 for GLP-1 and 1.4–1.5 for PYY) despite an almost 60% reduction in systemic metformin exposure for 500 mg Metformin DR compared with Metformin IR.\n\n A total of 26 randomised participants were included in study 2: 24 had at least one dose of study medication and at least one post-dose pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessment and were included in the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic intent-to-treat analysis; and 12 completed all treatment periods and were included in the evaluable population.\n\n In the evaluable population, Metformin DR administered once-daily in the morning had 28% (90% CI ?16%, ?39%) lower bioavailability (least squares mean ratio of metformin AUC0–24) compared with either once-daily in the evening or twice-daily, although the glucose-lowering effects were maintained.\n\n In both studies, adverse events were primarily gastrointestinal in nature, and indicated similar or improved tolerability for Metformin DR vs Metformin IR; there were no clinically meaningful differences in vital signs, physical examinations or laboratory values.\n\n\nConclusions/interpretation\nDissociation of gut hormone release and glucose lowering from plasma metformin exposure provides strong supportive evidence for a distal small intestine-mediated mechanism of action.\n\n Directly targeting the ileum with Metformin DR once-daily in the morning may provide maximal metformin efficacy with lower doses and substantially reduce plasma exposure.\n\n Metformin DR may minimise the risk of lactic acidosis in those at increased risk from metformin therapy, such as individuals with renal impairment.\n\n\n\nTrial registration:\n\nClinicaltrials.\n\ngov NCT01677299, NCT01804842\n\nFunding:\n\nThis study was funded by Elcelyx Therapeutics Inc.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe

Role of Incretins on Insulin Function and Glucose Homeostasis","abstract":"The incretin effect—the amplification of insulin secretion after oral vs intravenous administration of glucose as a mean to improve glucose tolerance—was suspected even before insulin was discovered, and today we know that the effect is due to the secretion of 2 insulinotropic peptides, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).\n But how important is it? Physiological experiments have shown that, because of the incretin effect, we can ingest increasing amounts of amounts of glucose (carbohydrates) without increasing postprandial glucose excursions, which otherwise might have severe consequences.\n The mechanism behind this is incretin-stimulated insulin secretion.\n The availability of antagonists for GLP-1 and most recently also for GIP has made it possible to directly estimate the individual contributions to postprandial insulin secretion of a) glucose itself: 26%; b) GIP: 45%; and c) GLP-1: 29%.\n Thus, in healthy individuals, GIP is the champion.\n When the action of both incretins is prevented, glucose tolerance is pathologically impaired.\n Thus, after 100 years of research, we now know that insulinotropic hormones from the gut are indispensable for normal glucose tolerance.\n The loss of the incretin effect in type 2 diabetes, therefore, contributes greatly to the impaired postprandial glucose control.\n","id":"PMC8168943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jens Juul","surname":"Holst","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lærke

potential therapeutic targets and locate a sensitive time window for intervention.\n In this study, we focus on the early stage of a high-fat diet mouse model: a short-term 3-week treatment.\n Our results showed that this short-term 3-week HFD can already induce significant body weight gain, increased adipocyte size and surprisingly, anxiety-like behavior of the animals.\n Then we tried the

diet-related obesity and autistic behaviors remain unclear.\n Metformin has proven to be beneficial in the treatment of many syndromes, including autism spectrum disorder.\n Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether metformin treatment could ameliorate metabolic and behavioral alterations in C57BL/6 mice kept on a high-fat diet (HFD), and whether these changes were related to modifications in the gut microbiota and 5-HT levels.\n As expected, ten weeks of HFD ingestion increased body weight, adiposity, and glucose levels.\n HFD-fed mice showed a marked aggravation of repetitive behaviors (marble burying and self-grooming), and this was prevented by metformin administration.\n In addition, HFD-fed mice increased the total distance travelled in the open field test.\n This hyperactivity was counteracted by metformin cotreatment.\n In the elevated plus maze test, HFD-fed mice showed a reduced number of entries into the open arms.\n Interestingly, both HFD and metformin cotreatment increased social interactions in the three-chamber test.\n HFD increased the levels of intestinal tryptophan and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.\n Metformin stimulated gut tryptophan and promoted the synthesis of 5-HT in the HFD group.\n Lactococcus, Trichococcus, Romboutsia, and Faecalibaculum were enriched in HFD-fed mice, whereas the HFD group cotreated with metformin was enriched in Intestinimonas and L.\n reuteri.\n Faecalibacterium was positively correlated with sociability and 5-HT pathway components in mice that received metformin.\n In summary, HFD consumption elicited a complex phenotype comprising higher levels of anxiety-like and repetitive behaviors but also increased sociability.\n Metformin could potentially improve HFD-induced disorders in the autistic spectrum through a mechanism involving positive modulation of 5-HT levels in the gut and its microbiota composition.\n","id":"PMC8872653","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wenlin","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haoran","surname":"Ke","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Siqi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zitong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sitao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pinjing","surname":"Lv","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fang","surname":"Li","email":"1195948845@qq.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ye","surname":"Chen","email":"yechen@smu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ye","surname":"Chen","email":"yechen@smu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.103037","date":"2020-09-14","title":"Metformin

mechanisms of mitochondrial health, such as mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis, are of crucial importance.\n The gold standard for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is metformin, which has a beneficial impact on the mitochondrial metabolism.\n In this study, we set out to describe the effect of metformin treatment on mitochondrial function and mitophagy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from type 2 diabetic patients.\n We performed a preliminary cross-sectional observational study complying with CONSORT requirements, for which we recruited 242 subjects, divided into 101 healthy volunteers, 93 metformin-treated type 2 diabetic patients and 48 non-metformin-treated type 2 diabetic patients.\n Mitochondria from the type 2 diabetic patients not treated with metformin displayed more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than those from healthy or metformin-treated subjects.\n Protein expression of the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes was lower in PBMCs from type 2 diabetic patients without metformin treatment than in those from the other two groups.\n Mitophagy was altered in type 2 diabetic patients, evident in a decrease in the protein levels of PINK1 and Parkin in parallel to that of the mitochondrial biogenesis protein PGC1?, both of which effects were reversed by metformin.\n Analysis of AMPK phosphorylation revealed that its activation was decreased in the PBMCs of type 2 diabetic patients, an effect which was reversed, once again, by metformin.\n In addition, there was an increase in the serum levels of TNF? and IL-6 in type 2 diabetic patients and this was reversed with metformin treatment.\n These results demonstrate that metformin improves mitochondrial function, restores the levels of ETC complexes, and enhances AMPK activation and mitophagy, suggesting beneficial clinical implications in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n","id":"PMC9124713","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Aranzazu

A Review of Potential Options for Therapeutic Intervention","abstract":"Aging is accompanied by remodeling of the immune system.\n With time, this leads to a decline in immune efficacy, resulting in increased vulnerability to infectious diseases, diminished responses to vaccination, and a susceptibility to age-related inflammatory diseases.\n An age-associated immune alteration, extensively reported in previous studies, is the reduction in the number of peripheral blood naïve cells, with a relative increase in the frequency of memory cells.\n These two alterations, together with inflamm-aging, are considered the hallmarks of immunosenescence.\n Because aging is a plastic process, it is influenced by both nutritional and pharmacological interventions.\n Therefore, the role of nutrition and of immunomodulation in immunosenescence is discussed, due to the multifactorial influence on these hallmarks.\n The close connection between nutrition, intake of bioactive nutrients and supplements, immune function, and inflammation demonstrate the key role of dietary strategies as regulators of immune response and inflammatory status, hence as possible modulators of the rate of immunosenescence.\n In addition, potential options for therapeutic intervention are clarified.\n In particular, the use of interleukin-7 as growth factor for naïve T cells, the function of checkpoint inhibitors in improving T cell responses during aging and, the potential of drugs that inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinases and their interaction with nutrient signaling pathways are discussed.\n Finally, it is suggested that the inclusion of appropriate combinations of toll-like receptor agonists may enhance the efficacy of vaccination in older

discovery more than 50?years ago, metformin represents a worldwide milestone in treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).\n Recent evidence in humans indicates novel pleiotropic actions of metformin which span from its consolidated role in T2D management up to various regulatory properties, including cardio- and nephro-protection, as well as antiproliferative, antifibrotic, and antioxidant effects.\n These findings, together with ground-breaking studies demonstrating its ability to prolong healthspan and lifespan in mice, provided the basis for defining metformin as a potential antiaging molecule.\n Moreover, emerging in vivo and in vitro evidence support the novel hypothesis that metformin can exhibit immune-modulatory features.\n Studies suggest that metformin interferes with key immunopathological mechanisms involved in systemic autoimmune diseases, such as the T helper 17/regulatory T cell balance, germinal centers formation, autoantibodies production, macrophage polarization, cytokine synthesis, neutrophil extracellular traps release, and bone or extracellular matrix remodeling.\n These effects may represent a powerful contributor to antiaging and anticancer properties exerted by metformin and, from another standpoint, may open the way to assess whether metformin can be a candidate molecule for clinical trials involving patients with immune-mediated diseases.\n In this article, we will review the available preclinical and clinical evidence regarding the effect of metformin on individual cells of the immune system, with emphasis on

receptor (CAR)-T-cells, have significant anti-tumor effects against certain types of cancer, providing a new paradigm for cancer treatment.\n However, the activity of tumor infiltrating T-cells (TILs) can be effectively neutralized in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of most solid tumors, rich in various immunosuppressive factors and cells.\n Therefore, to improve the clinical outcomes of established T-cell-based immunotherapy, adjuvants that can comprehensively relieve multiple immunosuppressive mechanisms of TME are needed.\n In this regard, recent studies have revealed that metformin has several beneficial effects on anti-tumor immunity.\n In this mini-review, we understand the immunosuppressive properties of TME and how metformin comprehensively enhances anti-tumor immunity.\n Finally, we will discuss this old friend’s potential as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy.\n","id":"PMC7607149","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"KyeongJin","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wen-Hao","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Youn-Sang","surname":"Jung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jong-ho","surname":"Cha","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1055/s-0034-1377044","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Latent

Cryopreserved tissues preserved 90% cell viability and contained heterogenous populations of metabolically active epithelial, endothelial, and immune cell subsets of the human lung.\n Samples were readily infected with HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrated comparable susceptibility to infection.\n In contrast, we observed a marked donor-dependent heterogeneity in the expression of IL6, CXCL8, and IFNB1 in response to SARS-CoV-2. Treatment of tissues with dexamethasone and the experimental drug N-hydroxycytidine suppressed viral growth in all samples, whereas chloroquine and remdesivir had no detectable effect.\n Metformin and sirolimus, molecules with predicted but unproven antiviral activity, each suppressed viral replication in tissues from a subset of donors.\n In summary, we developed a system for the ex vivo study of human SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human lung tissue from a library of donor tissues.\n This model may be useful for drug screening and for understanding basic mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis.\n","id":"PMC8492301","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthew A.","surname":"Schaller","email":"m.schaller@ufl.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yamini","surname":"Sharma","email":"Yamini.Sharma@medicine.ufl.edu","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yamini","surname":"Sharma","email":"Yamini.Sharma@medicine.ufl.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zadia","surname":"Dupee","email":"Zadia.Dupee@medicine.ufl.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Duy","surname":"Nguyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juan","surname":"Urueña","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ryan","surname":"Smolchek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julia C.","surname":"Loeb","email":"jloeb@phhp.ufl.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tiago N.","surname":"Machuca","email":"Tiago.noguchimachuca@surgery.ufl.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John A.","surname":"Lednicky","email":"jlednicky@phhp.ufl.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David J.","surname":"Odde","email":"oddex002@umn.edu","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"David J.","surname":"Odde","email":"oddex002@umn.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert F.","surname":"Campbell","email":"robert.f.campbell96.civ@mail.mil","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"W.

We hypothesized that binding by the viral spike protein mediates this effect, and that drugs which regulate immunometabolism could inhibit the inflammatory response.\n Monocytes stimulated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 showed a dose-dependent increase in glycolytic metabolism associated with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n This response was dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor-1?, as chetomin inhibited glycolysis and cytokine production.\n Inhibition of glycolytic metabolism by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) or glucose deprivation also inhibited the glycolytic response, and 2-DG strongly suppressed cytokine production.\n Glucose-deprived monocytes rescued cytokine production by upregulating oxidative phosphorylation, an effect which was not present in 2-DG-treated monocytes due to the known effect of 2-DG on suppressing mitochondrial metabolism.\n Finally, pre-treatment of monocytes with metformin strongly suppressed spike protein-mediated cytokine production and metabolic reprogramming.\n Likewise, metformin pre-treatment blocked cytokine induction by SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 in direct infection experiments.\n In summary, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces a pro-inflammatory immunometabolic response in monocytes that can be suppressed by metformin, and metformin likewise suppresses inflammatory responses to live SARS-CoV-2.

although the precise mechanism has not been elucidated yet.\n\n The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of metformin on energy metabolism and anthropometric factors in both human subjects and rats.\n\n\nMethods\nIn human studies, metformin (1500mg/day) was administered to 23 healthy subjects and 18 patients with type 2 diabetes for 2 weeks.\n\n Metabolic parameters and energy metabolism were measured during a meal tolerance test in the morning before and after the treatment of metformin.\n\n In animal studies, 13 weeks old SD rats were fed 25–26 g of standard chow only during 12-hours dark phase with either treated by metformin (2.5mg/ml in drinking water) or not for 2 weeks, and metabolic parameters, anthropometric factors and energy metabolism together with expressions related to fat oxidation and adaptive thermogenesis were measured either in fasting or post-prandial state at 15 weeks old.\n\n\nResults\nPost-prandial plasma lactate concentration was significantly increased after the metformin treatment in both healthy subjects and diabetic patients.\n\n Although energy expenditure (EE) did not change, baseline respiratory quotient (RQ) was significantly decreased and post-prandial RQ was significantly increased vice versa following the metformin treatment in both groups.\n\n By the administration of metformin to SD rats for 2 weeks, plasma levels of lactate and pyruvate were significantly increased in both fasting and post-prandial states.\n\n RQ during a fasting state was significantly decreased in metformin-treated rats compared to controls with no effect on EE.\n\n Metformin treatment brought about a significant reduction of visceral fat mass compared to controls accompanied by an up-regulation of fat oxidation-related enzyme in the liver, UCP-1 in the brown adipose tissue and UCP-3 in the skeletal muscle.\n\n\nConclusion\nFrom the results obtained, beneficial effects of metformin on visceral fat reduction has been demonstrated probably through a mechanism for a potential shift of fuel resource into fat oxidation and an upregulation of adaptive thermogenesis independent of an anorexigenic effect of this drug.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5291441","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ichiro","surname":"Tokubuchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuji","surname":"Tajiri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shimpei","surname":"Iwata","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kento","surname":"Hara","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nobuhiko","surname":"Wada","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Toshihiko","surname":"Hashinaga","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hitomi","surname":"Nakayama","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hiroharu","surname":"Mifune","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kentaro","surname":"Yamada","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.

city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and
