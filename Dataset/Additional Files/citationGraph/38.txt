The state is now the epicenter of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in the United States, with 84,735 cases reported as of April 2, 2020. We previously presented an early case series with 7 coronavirus disease 2019–positive pregnant patients, 2 of whom were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 after an initial asymptomatic presentation.\n\n We now describe a series of 43 test-positive cases of coronavirus disease 2019 presenting to an affiliated pair of New York City hospitals for more than 2 weeks, from March 13, 2020, to March 27, 2020. A total of 14 patients (32.6%) presented without any coronavirus disease 2019–associated viral symptoms and were identified after they developed symptoms during admission or after the implementation of universal testing for all obstetric admissions on March 22. Among them, 10 patients (71.4%) developed symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 over the course of their delivery admission or early after postpartum discharge.\n\n Of the other 29 patients (67.4%) who presented with symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019, 3 women ultimately required antenatal admission for viral symptoms, and another patient re-presented with worsening respiratory status requiring oxygen supplementation 6 days postpartum after a successful labor induction.\n\n There were no confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 detected in neonates upon initial testing on the first day of life.\n\n Based on coronavirus disease 2019 disease severity characteristics by Wu and McGoogan, 37 women (86%) exhibited mild disease, 4 (9.3%) severe disease, and 2 (4.7%) critical disease; these percentages are similar to those described in nonpregnant adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (about 80% mild, 15% severe, and 5% critical disease).\n\n","id":"PMC7144599","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Noelle","surname":"Breslin","email":"nb2565@cumc.columbia.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Caitlin","surname":"Baptiste","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cynthia","surname":"Gyamfi-Bannerman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Russell","surname":"Miller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rebecca","surname":"Martinez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kyra","surname":"Bernstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laurence","surname":"Ring","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruth","surname":"Landau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephanie","surname":"Purisch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexander M.","surname":"Friedman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Karin","surname":"Fuchs","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Desmond","surname":"Sutton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Andrikopoulou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Devon","surname":"Rupley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Ju","surname":"Sheen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Janice","surname":"Aubey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Noelia","surname":"Zork","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leslie","surname":"Moroz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mirella","surname":"Mourad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ronald","surname":"Wapner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lynn L.","surname":"Simpson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mary E.","surname":"D’Alton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                            Dena","surname":"Goffman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel coronavirus:China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

study aimed to estimate influenza-associated mortality, considering both periodic changes and age-specific mortality by influenza subtypes.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing the Microdata Integrated Service from Statistics Korea, we collected weekly mortality data including cause of death.\n\n Laboratory surveillance data of respiratory viruses from 2009 to 2016 were obtained from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n After adjusting for the annual age-specific population size, we used a negative binomial regression model by age group and influenza subtype.\n\n\nResults\nOverall, 1 859 890 deaths were observed and the average rate of influenza virus positivity was 14.7% (standard deviation [SD], 5.8), with the following subtype distribution: A(H1N1), 5.0% (SD, 5.8); A(H3N2), 4.4% (SD, 3.4); and B, 5.3% (SD, 3.7).\n\n As a result, among individuals under 65 years old, 6774 (0.51%) all-cause deaths, 2521 (3.05%) respiratory or circulatory deaths, and 1048 (18.23%) influenza or pneumonia deaths were estimated.\n\n Among those 65 years of age or older, 30 414 (2.27%) all-cause deaths, 16 411 (3.42%) respiratory or circulatory deaths, and 4906 (6.87%) influenza or pneumonia deaths were estimated.\n\n Influenza A(H3N2) virus was the major contributor to influenza-associated all-cause and respiratory or circulatory deaths in both age groups.\n\n However, influenza A(H1N1) virus–associated influenza or pneumonia deaths were more common in those under 65 years old.\n\n\nConclusions\nInfluenza-associated mortality was substantial during this period, especially in the elderly.\n\n By subtype, influenza A(H3N2) virus made the largest contribution to influenza-associated mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6780294","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kwan","surname":"Hong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sangho","surname":"Sohn","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sangho","surname":"Sohn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Byung

The most common clinical manifestations of covid-19 in pregnancy were fever and cough (both 36%).\n\n Compared with non-pregnant women of reproductive age, pregnant and recently pregnant women with covid-19 were less likely to report symptoms of fever, dyspnoea, cough, and myalgia.\n\n The odds of admission to an intensive care unit (odds ratio 2.61, 95% confidence interval 1.84 to 3.71; I2=85.6%), and invasive ventilation (2.41, 2.13 to 2.71; I2=0%) were higher in pregnant and recently pregnant than non-pregnant women of reproductive age.\n\n Overall, 970 pregnant women (0.2%, 123 studies, 179 981 women) with confirmed covid-19 died from any cause.\n\n In pregnant women with covid-19, non-white ethnicity, increased maternal age, high body mass index, any pre-existing maternal comorbidity including chronic hypertension and diabetes, and pregnancy specific complications such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, were associated with serious complications (severe covid-19, admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, and maternal death).\n\n Compared to pregnant women without covid-19, those with the disease had increased odds of maternal death (odds ratio 6.09, 95% confidence interval 1.82 to 20.38; I2=76.6%), of admission to the intensive care unit (5.41, 3.59 to 8.14; I2=57.0%), caesarean section (1.17, 1.01 to 1.36; I2=80.3%), and of preterm birth (1.57, 1.36 to 1.81; I2=49.3%).\n\n The odds of stillbirth (1.81, 1.38 to 2.37, I2=0%), and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (2.18, 1.46 to 3.26, I2=85.4%) were higher in babies born to women with covid-19 versus those without covid-19.\nConclusion\nPregnant and recently pregnant women with covid-19 attending or admitted to the hospitals for any reason are less likely to manifest symptoms such as fever, cough, dyspnoea, and myalgia, but are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit or needing invasive ventilation than non-pregnant women of reproductive age.\n\n Pre-existing comorbidities, non-white ethnicity, chronic hypertension, pre-existing diabetes, high maternal age, and high body mass index are risk factors for severe covid-19 outcomes in pregnancy.\n\n Pregnant women with covid-19 versus without covid-19 are more likely to deliver preterm and have an increased risk of maternal death and of being admitted to the intensive care unit.\n\n Their babies are more likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.\n\n\nSystematic review registration\nPROSPERO CRD42020178076.\nReaders’ note\nThis article is a living

Factors influencing acceptance of vaccination were: being slightly older, multiparity, having discussed it with a caregiver and acceptance of the influenza vaccine.\n\n\nDiscussion\nNearly one-third of pregnant women in this population would be willing to be vaccinated.\n\n In addition to studies establishing fetal safety, public health agencies and healthcare professionals should provide accurate information about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8820613","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Charles","surname":"Egloff","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Camille","surname":"Couffignal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anne Gael","surname":"Cordier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Deruelle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jeanne","surname":"Sibiude","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olivia","surname":"Anselem","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandra","surname":"Benachi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dominique","surname":"Luton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laurent","surname":"Mandelbrot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christelle","surname":"Vauloup-Fellous","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Christelle","surname":"Vauloup-Fellous","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexandre J.","surname":"Vivanti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olivier","surname":"Picone","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Olivier","surname":"Picone","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sharon Mary","surname":"Brownie","email":"NULL","contributions":"7"},{"firstname":"Sharon Mary","surname":"Brownie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sharon Mary","surname":"Brownie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Russell","surname":"Kabir","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Russell","surname":"Kabir","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sharon Mary","surname":"Brownie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sharon Mary","surname":"Brownie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sharon Mary","surname":"Brownie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sharon Mary","surname":"Brownie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajog.2021.08.007","date":"2021-08-01","title":"COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy: coverage and safety","abstract":"Background\nConcerns have been raised regarding a potential surge of COVID-19 in pregnancy, secondary to the rising numbers of COVID-19 in the community, easing of societal restrictions, and vaccine hesitancy.\n\n Although COVID-19 vaccination is now offered to all pregnant women in the United Kingdom; limited data exist on its uptake and safety.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aimed to investigate the uptake and safety of COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women.\n\n\nStudy Design\nThis was a cohort study of pregnant women who gave birth at St George’s University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom, between March 1, 2020, and July 4, 2021. The primary outcome was uptake of COVID-19 vaccination and its determinants.\n\n The secondary outcomes were perinatal safety outcomes.\n\n Data were collected on COVID-19 vaccination uptake, vaccination type, gestational age at vaccination, and maternal characteristics, including age, parity, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation score, and comorbidities.\n\n Further data were collected on perinatal outcomes, including stillbirth (fetal death at ?24 weeks’ gestation), preterm birth, fetal and congenital abnormalities, and intrapartum complications.\n\n Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes of women who received the vaccine were compared with that of a matched cohort of women with balanced propensity scores.\n\n Effect magnitudes of vaccination on perinatal outcomes were reported as mean differences or odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.\n\n Factors associated with antenatal vaccination were assessed with logistic regression analysis.\n\n\nResults\nData were available for 1328 pregnant women of whom 140 received at least 1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine before giving birth and 1188 women who did not; 85.7% of those vaccinated received their vaccine in the third trimester of pregnancy and 14.3% in the second trimester of pregnancy.\n\n Of those vaccinated, 127 (90.7%) received a messenger RNA vaccine and 13 (9.3%) a viral vector vaccine.\n\n There was evidence of reduced vaccine uptake in younger women (P=.\n\n001), women with high levels of deprivation (ie, fifth quintile of the index of multiple deprivation; P=.\n\n008), and women of Afro-Caribbean or Asian ethnicity compared with women of White ethnicity (P&lt;.\n\n001).\n\n Women with prepregnancy diabetes mellitus had increased vaccine uptake (P=.\n\n008).\n\n In the multivariable model the fifth deprivation quintile (most deprived) (adjusted odds ratio, 0.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.02–0.10; P=.\n\n003) and Afro-Caribbean ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.06–0.85; P=.\n\n044) were significantly associated with lower antenatal vaccine uptake, whereas prepregnancy diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with higher antenatal vaccine uptake (adjusted odds ratio, 10.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.74–83.2; P=.\n\n014).\n\n In a propensity score–matched cohort, the rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes of 133 women who received at least 1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy were similar to that of unvaccinated pregnant women (P&gt;.\n\n05 for all): stillbirth (0.0% vs 0.2%), fetal abnormalities (2.2% vs 2.5%), postpartum hemorrhage (9.8% vs 9.0%), cesarean delivery (30.8% vs 34.1%), small for gestational age (12.0% vs 12.8%), maternal high-dependency unit or intensive care admission (6.0% vs 4.0%), or neonatal intensive care unit admission (5.3% vs 5.0%).\n\n Intrapartum pyrexia (3.7% vs 1.0%; P=.\n\n046) was significantly increased but the borderline statistical significance was lost after excluding women with antenatal COVID-19 infection (P=.\n\n079).\n\n Mixed-effects Cox regression showed that vaccination was not significantly associated with birth at &lt;40 weeks’ gestation (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–1.23; P=.\n\n624).\n\n\nConclusion\nOf pregnant women eligible for COVID-19 vaccination, less than one-third accepted COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, and they experienced similar pregnancy outcomes with unvaccinated pregnant women.\n\n There was lower uptake among younger women, non-White ethnicity, and lower socioeconomic background.\n\n This study has contributed to the body of evidence that having COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy does not alter perinatal outcomes.\n\n Clear communication to improve awareness among pregnant women and healthcare professionals on vaccine safety is needed, alongside strategies to address vaccine hesitancy.\n\n These strategies include postvaccination surveillance to gather further data on pregnancy outcomes, particularly after first-trimester vaccination, and long-term infant follow-up.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8352848","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Helena","surname":"Blakeway","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Smriti","surname":"Prasad","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Erkan","surname":"Kalafat","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul T.","surname":"Heath","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shamez N.","surname":"Ladhani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kirsty","surname":"Le Doare","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura A.","surname":"Magee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pat","surname":"O’Brien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Arezou","surname":"Rezvani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"von Dadelszen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Asma","surname":"Khalil","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41591-021-01666-2","date":"2021-12-20","title":"SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination rates in pregnant women in Scotland","abstract":"id='Par1'>Population-level data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake in pregnancy and SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes are lacking.\n We describe COVID-19 vaccine uptake and SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women in Scotland, using whole-population data from a national, prospective cohort.\n Between the start of a COVID-19 vaccine program in Scotland, on 8 December 2020 and 31 October 2021, 25,917 COVID-19 vaccinations were given to 18,457 pregnant women.\n Vaccine coverage was substantially lower in pregnant women than in the general female population of 18?44 years;

indecision among the public toward vaccination.\n\n Because pregnant and reproductive-aged women account for a large proportion of the population with particular concerns regarding vaccination against COVID-19, this survey aimed at investigating their current attitudes and beliefs within our own institution.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to understand vaccine acceptability among pregnant, nonpregnant, and breastfeeding respondents and elucidate factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nWe administered an anonymous online survey to all women (including patients, providers, and staff) at our institution assessing rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n Respondents were contacted in 1 of 3 ways: by email, advertisement flyers, and distribution of quick response codes at virtual town halls regarding the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n Based on their responses, respondents were divided into 3 mutually exclusive groups: (1) nonpregnant respondents, (2) pregnant respondents, and (3) breastfeeding respondents.\n\n The primary outcome was acceptance of vaccination.\n\n Prevalence ratios were calculated to ascertain the independent effects of multiple patient-level factors on vaccine acceptability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe survey was administered from January 7, 2021, to January 29, 2021, with 1012 respondents of whom 466 (46.9%) identified as non-Hispanic White, 108 (10.9%) as non-Hispanic Black, 286 (28.8%) as Hispanic, and 82 (8.2%) as non-Hispanic Asian.\n\n The median age was 36 years (interquartile range, 25–47 years).\n\n Of all the respondents, 656 respondents (64.8%) were nonpregnant, 216 (21.3%) were pregnant, and 122 (12.1%) were breastfeeding.\n\n There was no difference in chronic comorbidities when evaluated as a composite variable (Table 1).\n\n A total of 390 respondents (39.2%) reported working in healthcare.\n\n Nonpregnant respondents were most likely to accept vaccination (457 respondents, 76.2%; P&lt;.\n\n001) with breastfeeding respondents the second most likely (55.2%).\n\n Pregnant respondents had the lowest rate of vaccine acceptance (44.3%; P&lt;.\n\n001).\n\n Prevalence ratios revealed all non-White races except for non-Hispanic Asian respondents, and Spanish-speaking respondents were less likely to accept vaccination (Table 3).\n\n Working in healthcare was not found to be associated with vaccine acceptance among our cohort.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this survey study of only women at a single institution, pregnant respondents of non-White or non-Asian races were more likely to decline vaccination than nonpregnant and breastfeeding respondents.\n\n Working in healthcare was not associated with vaccine

virus vaccine compliance among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic (pre-vaccine era) in Israel and future intention to uptake BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine","abstract":"The influenza virus vaccine, used worldwide as an annual preventive measure, is especially recommended for at-risk populations.\n Older adults and pregnant women are therefore offered the flu shot free of charge in Israel.\n The Israel Ministry of Health’s rationale for giving the influenza vaccine to pregnant women is to avoid serious complications that could harm both mother and foetus.\n In Israel, the winter of 2020/2021 was marked by a third surge of COVID-19, raising the risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the level of fear among the population.\n The influenza vaccine protects individuals from the flu and thus helps prevent an additional burden on medical centres treating COVID-19 patients.\n The aim of the present study was to assess compliance of pregnant and postpartum women to influenza vaccine uptake during winter 20/21 period.\n A survey questionnaire was distributed to examine factors predicting women’s attitudes toward the influenza vaccine.\n Questionnaire items based on the Heath Belief Model examined participants’ perceptions regarding influenza and the vaccine.\n The questionnaire also evaluated participants’ hypothetical willingness to get immunized with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine upon its arrival in Israel.\n The results showed a higher prevalence of influenza vaccine uptake among Jewish women than Arab women, while level of trust in healthcare providers was stronger among Arab participants than among Jewish participants.\n The findings indicate that the pregnant and postpartum community needs better information dissemination and education regarding the importance of the influenza vaccine.\n Decisions regarding uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine upon future availability were found to be unrelated to influenza vaccine perceptions.\n The results call for raising public awareness regarding influenza immunization in addition to offering the vaccine at routine pregnancy follow-up appointments.\n","id":"PMC8843331","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ola

where data are available, one-third of pregnant women remain unvaccinated despite receiving a recommendation.\n\n Therefore, it is essential to understand the significance of other factors and distinguish between vaccines administered routinely and during outbreaks.\n\n This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD 42019118299) to examine the strength of the relationships between identified factors and maternal vaccination uptake.\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase Classic &amp; Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science, IBSS, LILACS, AfricaWideInfo, IMEMR, and Global Health databases for studies reporting factors that influence maternal vaccination.\n\n We used random-effects models to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) of being vaccinated by vaccine type.\n\n\nFindings\nWe screened 17,236 articles and identified 120 studies from 30 countries for inclusion.\n\n Of these, 49 studies were eligible for meta-analysis.\n\n The odds of receiving a pertussis or influenza vaccination were ten to twelve-times higher among pregnant women who received a recommendation from HCPs.\n\n During the 2009 influenza pandemic an HCP recommendation increased the odds of antenatal H1N1 vaccine uptake six times (OR 6.76, 95% CI 3.12–14.64, I2 = 92.00%).\n\n Believing there was potential for vaccine-induced harm had a negative influence on seasonal (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11–0.44 I2 = 84.00%) and pandemic influenza vaccine uptake (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.09–0.29, I2 = 89.48%), reducing the odds of being vaccinated five-fold.\n\n Combined with our qualitative analysis the relationship between the belief in substantial disease risk and maternal seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination uptake was limited.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe effect of an HCP recommendation during an outbreak, whilst still powerful, may be muted by other factors.\n\n This requires further research, particularly when vaccines are novel.\n\n Public health campaigns which centre on the protectiveness and safety of a maternal vaccine rather than disease threat alone may prove beneficial.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7347125","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Eliz","surname":"Kilich","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sara","surname":"Dada","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sara","surname":"Dada","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark

clinical staff.\n\n\nMethod\nA paper-based survey was distributed to postnatal women.\n\n HCPs completed the survey via the online tool Survey Monkey.\n\n\nResults\n330 patient surveys were disseminated, with a 60.0% response rate.\n\n Of 198 responders, 109 (55.1%) were vaccinated against influenza.\n\n Non-professionals were less likely to be vaccinated (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.09 to 0.89).\n\n Vaccination in previous pregnancy (aOR 5.2, 95% CI = 1.69 to 15.62) and information from an HCP were strongly associated with vaccination (aOR 12.8, 95% CI = 2.65 to 62.5).\n\n There was a 20.2% (n = 1180) response rate among HCPs.\n\n More GPs felt that it was their role to discuss vaccination (92.9%; n = 676), and offer to vaccinate women (91.7%; n = 666) than any other HCP.\n\n\nConclusion\nProvision of information about the importance of vaccination against influenza and pertussis during pregnancy by HCPs and their consistent recommendations in support of vaccination were key determinants of vaccine uptake during pregnancy.\n\n The sociodemographic determinants of a woman’s vaccination status should be addressed in health promotion campaigns.\n\n Education of HCPs may address knowledge gaps surrounding vaccination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6189777","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tina","surname":"Barrett","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edel","surname":"McEntee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Drew","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fiona","surname":"O’Reilly","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Austin","surname":"O’Carroll","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aisling","surname":"O’Shea","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Brian","surname":"Cleary","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0263234","date":"2022-01-17","title":"Views and experiences of maternal healthcare providers regarding influenza vaccine during pregnancy globally: A systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis","abstract":"Background\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that pregnant women receive influenza vaccination; however, uptake of the vaccine remains low.\n\n Maternity health care professionals (MHCPs) play an important role in motivating pregnant women to receive the influenza vaccine.\n\n However, factors such as MHCPs’ views and knowledge about the vaccine, and time constraints due to workload may influence MHCPs’ practices and opinions about women receiving the influenza vaccine during pregnancy.\n\n To date, the qualitative evidence exploring MHCPs’ views and experiences around influenza vaccine uptake in pregnant women has not been synthesised.\n\n\nAim\nTo systematically review and thematically synthesise qualitative evidence that explores the views and experiences of MHCPs involved in the provision of the maternal influenza vaccine worldwide.\n\n\nMethods\nFive databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science) were searched, supplemented with searches of included paper reference lists and grey literature.\n\n Study selection was conducted by up to three researchers applying pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\n Quality assessment was undertaken, data were extracted, coded and synthesised to develop descriptive and analytical themes.\n\n\nResults\nEight studies involving 277 participants were included.\n\n Seventeen descriptive themes were interpreted, embedded within six analytical themes.\n\n MHCPs perceived that maternal influenza vaccination delivery can be facilitated by trusting relationships, good communication, knowledge about the vaccine leading to confidence in recommending vaccine, electronic vaccination prompts, and presence of national guidelines.\n\n However, workload, time constraints, MHCP’s perception of pregnant women’s concerns, and social/cultural/environmental influences could prevent the likelihood of delivery of influenza vaccine.\n\n Knowledgeable MHCPs who were regularly updated about vaccination based on scientific evidence were more confident when discussing and recommending the influenza vaccine to pregnant women.\n\n In addition, the presence of national policies and guidelines and electronic prompts for maternal influenza vaccination would enhance the delivery of the vaccine.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur findings suggest that approaches to enhance the vaccination uptake rate in pregnant women include addressing MHCPs barriers to discussing influenza vaccination through education, sufficient time for discussions, and electronic prompts about vaccination, as well as evidence based local and national guidelines.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8830613","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fatemah","surname":"Alhendyani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kate","surname":"Jolly","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Kate","surname":"Jolly","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura

COVID-19 vaccine uptake during pregnancy: ‘Hesitance’, knowledge, and evidence-based decision-making","abstract":"Background\nA key mitigation strategy to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the development and roll-out of vaccines.\n\n However, pregnant and lactating people were not included in initial vaccine trials and this population is hesitant to receive the vaccine, despite contrary recommendations from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Understanding the reasons behind this hesitancy is vital to promote vaccine uptake.\n\n\nMethods\nWe surveyed pregnant people in California from December 2020 to January 2021 (n = 387) to describe cognitions and decision-making regarding COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n Using descriptive, regression-based analyses, we examined rates of planned uptake and reasoning among individuals who reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.\n\n\nResults\nOverall, the pregnant Californians that we surveyed were aware of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n Of 387 participants, 43% reported planning to get the vaccine as soon as possible.\n\n The remaining 57% were hesitant: 27% responded that they would not receive the vaccine.\n\n Some demographic features did predict more COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, particularly younger age (AOR = 0.95, p = 0.025) and living in a less urban context (AOR = 0.80, p = 0.041).\n\n Essential worker status also was associated with vaccine hesitancy.\n\n Having had, or intending to have, a flu vaccine was negatively associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (p &lt; 0.001).\n\n The most commonly reported reason for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was “I don’t know enough about the vaccine.\n\n” Low levels of self-reported knowledge were highly predictive of hesitancy.\n\n\nConclusions\nTerms like “vaccine hesitance” and “anti-vax” do not adequately characterize decisions regarding delaying COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n Rather, these decisions are largely based on the lack of knowledge about the impacts of vaccination on pregnancy, fetal development, and later child wellbeing.\n\n This lack of knowledge should be countered by conversations between individual healthcare providers and their pregnant patients, and better inclusion of pregnant people and children in vaccine trials.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8947956","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Leigh Ann","surname":"Simmons","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mackenzie

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available.\n\n\nResults\nWe report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells.\n\n These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.\n\n In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations.\n\n\nConclusion\nChloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture.\n\n Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection.\n\n In addition, the indirect immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV antiviral compounds.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1232869","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Martin J","surname":"Vincent","email":"mvincent@cdc.gov","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Bergeron","email":"bergere@ircm.qc.ca","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suzanne","surname":"Benjannet","email":"benjans@ircm.qc.ca","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bobbie R","surname":"Erickson","email":"BErickson1@cdc.gov","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierre E","surname":"Rollin","email":"PRollin@cdc.gov","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas G","surname":"Ksiazek","email":"TKsiazek@cdc.gov","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nabil G","surname":"Seidah","email":"seidahn@ircm.qc.ca","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stuart T","surname":"Nichol","email":"SNichol@cdc.gov","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Potential antiviral therapeutics for 2019 novel coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Critical care management of adults with community-acquired severe respiratory viral infection","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1093/cid/ciu237","date":"2014-02-28","title":"Lower Respiratory Tract Virus Findings in Mechanically Ventilated Patients With Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia","abstract":"Among 45 of 49 (92%) patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia, viral etiology was identified in 49% of patients, whereas 43% had pure bacterial infections.\n Clinical characteristics and outcome were similar between patients with pure bacterial and those with bacterial–viral infections.\n","id":"PMC4305142","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"J.","surname":"Karhu","email":"jaana.m.karhu@ppshp.fi","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"T.

pimodivir, and baloxavir are inhibitory in preclinical models for influenza A viruses, including pandemic threat viruses and those resistant to currently approved antivirals, and two (favipiravir and baloxavir) also inhibit influenza B viruses.\n\n All are orally administered, although the dosing regimens vary.\n\n The polymerase basic protein 1 transcriptase inhibitor favipiravir has shown inconsistent clinical effects in uncomplicated influenza, and is teratogenic effects in multiple species, contraindicating its use in pregnancy.\n\n The polymerase basic protein 2 cap-binding inhibitor pimodivir displays antiviral effects alone and in combination with oseltamivir in uncomplicated influenza, although variants with reduced susceptibility emerge frequently during monotherapy.\n\n Single doses of the polymerase acidic protein cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir are effective in alleviating symptoms and rapidly inhibiting viral replication in otherwise healthy and higher risk patients with acute influenza, although variants with reduced susceptibility emerge frequently during monotherapy.\n\n Combinations of newer polymerase inhibitors with neuraminidase inhibitors show synergy in preclinical models and are currently undergoing clinical testing in hospitalized patients.\n\n\nSummary\nThese new polymerase inhibitors promise to add to

A(H1N1pdm09)-related critical illness","abstract":"Background\nPatients with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1pdm09)-related critical illness were frequently treated with systemic corticosteroids.\n\n While observational studies have reported significant corticosteroid-associated mortality after adjusting for baseline differences in patients treated with corticosteroids or not, corticosteroids have remained a common treatment in subsequent influenza outbreaks, including avian influenza A(H7N9).\n\n Our objective was to describe the use of corticosteroids in these patients and investigate predictors of steroid prescription and clinical outcomes, adjusting for both baseline and time-dependent factors.\n\n\nMethods\nIn an observational cohort study of adults with H1N1pdm09-related critical illness from 51 Canadian ICUs, we investigated predictors of steroid administration and outcomes of patients who received and those who did not receive corticosteroids.\n\n We adjusted for potential baseline confounding using multivariate logistic regression and propensity score analysis and adjusted for potential time-dependent confounding using marginal structural models.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 607 patients, corticosteroids were administered to 280 patients (46.1 %) at a median daily dose of 227 (interquartile range, 154–443) mg of hydrocortisone equivalents for a median of 7.0 (4.0–13.0) days.\n\n Compared with patients who did not receive corticosteroids, patients who received corticosteroids had higher hospital crude mortality (25.5 % vs 16.4 %, p?=?0.007) and fewer ventilator-free days at 28 days (12.5?±?10.7 vs 15.7?±?10.1, p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n The odds ratio association between corticosteroid use and hospital mortality decreased from 1.85 (95 % confidence interval 1.12–3.04, p?=?0.02) with multivariate logistic regression, to 1.71 (1.05–2.78, p?=?0.03) after adjustment for propensity score to receive corticosteroids, to 1.52 (0.90–2.58, p?=?0.12) after case-matching on propensity score, and to 0.96 (0.28–3.28, p?=?0.95) using marginal structural modeling to adjust for time-dependent between-group differences.\n\n\nConclusions\nCorticosteroids were commonly prescribed for H1N1pdm09-related critical illness.\n\n Adjusting for only baseline between-group differences suggested a significant increased risk of death associated with corticosteroids.\n\n However, after adjusting for time-dependent differences, we found no significant association between corticosteroids and mortality.\n\n These findings highlight the challenges and importance in adjusting for baseline and time-dependent confounders when estimating clinical effects of treatments using observational studies.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-016-1230-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

It was noted that decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation was associated with inhibited nuclear factor (NF)-?B activation, reduced reactive oxygen species production and increased autophagy.\n Additionally, the combined treatment reduced the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and decreased inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue and bronchioalveolar lavage fluid.\n Consistently, it inhibited the mTOR-NF-?B-NLRP3 inflammasome-IL-1? axis in a lung epithelial cell line.\n These results demonstrated that combined treatment with sirolimus and oseltamivir

with influenza A or B infection (FLU-IVIG): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nSince the 1918 influenza pandemic, non-randomised studies and small clinical trials have suggested that convalescent plasma or anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) might have clinical benefit for patients with influenza infection, but definitive data do not exist.\n\n We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hIVIG in a randomised controlled trial.\n\n\nMethods\nThis randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was planned for 45 hospitals in Argentina, Australia, Denmark, Greece, Mexico, Spain, Thailand, UK, and the USA over five influenza seasons from 2013–14 to 2017–18. Adults (?18 years of age) were admitted for hospital treatment with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B infection and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard care plus either a single 500-mL infusion of high-titre hIVIG (0·25 g/kg bodyweight, 24·75 g maximum; hIVIG group) or saline placebo (placebo group).\n\n Eligible patients had a National Early Warning score of 2 points or greater at the time of screening and their symptoms began no more than 7 days before randomisation.\n\n Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded, as well as any patients for whom the treatment would present a health risk.\n\n Separate randomisation schedules were generated for each participating clinical site using permuted block randomisation.\n\n Treatment assignments were obtained using a web-based application by the site pharmacist who then masked the solution for infusion.\n\n Patients and investigators were masked to study treatment.\n\n The primary endpoint was a six-category ordinal outcome of clinical status at day 7, ranging in severity from death to resumption of normal activities after discharge.\n\n The choice of day 7 was based on haemagglutination inhibition titres from a pilot study.\n\n It was analysed with a proportional odds model, using all six categories to estimate a common odds ratio (OR).\n\n An OR greater than 1 indicated that, for a given category, patients in the hIVIG group were more likely to be in a better category than those in the placebo group.\n\n Prespecified primary analyses for safety and efficacy were based on patients who received an infusion and for whom eligibility could be confirmed.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT02287467.\n\n\nFindings\n313 patients were enrolled in 34 sites between Dec 11, 2014, and May 28, 2018. We also used data from 16 patients enrolled at seven of the 34 sites during the pilot study between Jan 15, 2014, and April 10, 2014. 168 patients were randomly assigned to the hIVIG group and 161 to the placebo group.\n\n 21 patients were excluded (12 from the hIVIG group and 9 from the placebo group) because they did not receive an infusion or their eligibility could not be confirmed.\n\n Thus, 308 were included in the primary analysis.\n\n hIVIG treatment produced a robust rise in haemagglutination inhibition titres against influenza A and smaller rises in influenza B titres.\n\n Based on the proportional odds model, the OR on day 7 was 1·25 (95% CI 0·79–1·97; p=0·33).\n\n In subgroup analyses for the primary outcome, the OR in patients with influenza A was 0·94 (0·55–1·59) and was 3·19 (1·21–8·42) for those with influenza B (interaction p=0·023).\n\n Through 28 days of follow-up, 47 (30%) of 156 patients in the hIVIG group and in 45 (30%) of 152 patients in the placebo group had the composite safety outcome of death, a serious adverse event, or a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (hazard ratio [HR] 1·06, 95% CI 0·70–1·60; p=0·79).\n\n Six (4%) patients in the hIVIG group and five (3%) in the placebo group died, but these deaths were not necessarily related to treatment.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWhen administered alongside standard care (most commonly oseltamivir), hIVIG was not superior to placebo for adults hospitalised with influenza infection.\n\n By contrast with our prespecified subgroup hypothesis that hIVIG would result in more favourable responses in patients with influenza A than B, we found the opposite effect.\n\n The clinical benefit of hIVIG for patients with influenza B is supported by antibody affinity analyses, but confirmation is warranted.\n\n\nFunding\nNIAID and NIH.\n\n Partial support was provided by the Medical Research Council (MRC_UU_12023/23) and the Danish National Research Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6868512","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Richard

regional hospital in Hong Kong from March 9 to April 28, 2003, and who had SARS-related respiratory distress complications were recruited for NIPPV usage.\n\n The health status of all health-care workers working in the NIPPV wards was closely monitored, and consent was obtained to check serum for coronavirus serology.\n\n Patient outcomes and the risk of SARS transmission to health-care workers were assessed.\n\n\nResults:\nNIPPV was applied to 20 patients (11 male patients) with ARF secondary to SARS.\n\n Mean age was 51.4 years, and mean acute physiology and chronic health
