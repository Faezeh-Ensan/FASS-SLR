In total, this included 18 patients over this time period.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 18 patients were managed with extracorporeal support and of these 14 survived (78%) with 4 deaths (22%).\n\n The mean duration from hospital admission to intubation was 4.1 ± 3.4 days, mean time from intubation to ECMO 2.3 ± 2 days and mean run on ECMO 17.7 ± 9.4 days.\n\n Survivor mean days from intubation to extubation was 20.6 ± 9.9 days and survivor mean days from intubation to tracheostomy decannulation 46.6 ± 15.3 days.\n\n Time from hospital admission to discharge in survivors was a mean of 57.2 ± 25.8 days.\n\n Of the patients requiring extracorporeal support, the initial mode was veno-venous (VV) in 15 (83%), veno-arterial (VA) in 2 (11%) and veno-venous-arterial (VVA) in 1 (6%).\n\n On VV extracorporeal support, 2 (11%) required additional VVA.\n\n Renal replacement therapy was required in 10 (56%) of the patients.\n\n Anticoagulation target anti-Xa of 0.2–0.4 was set, with 10 (56%) patients having a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism detected and 2 (11%) patients suffering an intracranial haemorrhage.\n\n Tracheostomy was performed in 9 (50%) of the patients and high-dose methylprednisolone was given to 7 (39%) of the patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn our cohort of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure, a long period of invasive ventilation and extracorporeal support was required but achieving good outcomes despite this.\n\n There was a significant burden of thromboembolic disease and renal injury.\n\n A significant proportion of patients required tracheostomy and steroids to facilitate weaning.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7683277","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Waqas","surname":"Akhtar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Olusegun","surname":"Olusanya","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Olusegun","surname":"Olusanya","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Marta Montero","surname":"Baladia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Harriet","surname":"Young","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                           Sachin","surname":"Shah","email":"s.shah4@nhs.net","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Zhou F, Yu T, Du R, et al.

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can have symptoms that rapidly evolve to profound hypoxaemia and death.\n\n The efficacy of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with severe ARDS in the context of COVID-19 is unclear.\n\n We aimed to establish the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with respiratory failure and COVID-19 treated with ECMO.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective cohort study was done in the Paris–Sorbonne University Hospital Network, comprising five intensive care units (ICUs) and included patients who received ECMO for COVID-19 associated ARDS.\n\n Patient demographics and daily pre-ECMO and on-ECMO data and outcomes were collected.\n\n Possible outcomes over time were categorised into four different states (states 1–4): on ECMO, in the ICU and weaned off ECMO, alive and out of ICU, or death.\n\n Daily probabilities of occupation in each state and of transitions between these states until day 90 post-ECMO onset were estimated with use of a multi-state Cox model stratified for each possible transition.\n\n Follow-up was right-censored on July 10, 2020.\nFindings\nFrom March 8 to May 2, 2020, 492 patients with COVID-19 were treated in our ICUs.\n\n Complete day-60 follow-up was available for 83 patients (median age 49 [IQR 41–56] years and 61 [73%] men) who received ECMO.\n\n Pre-ECMO, 78 (94%) patients had been prone-positioned; their median driving pressure was 18 (IQR 16–21) cm H2O and PaO2/FiO2 was 60 (54–68) mm Hg.\n\n At 60 days post-ECMO initiation, the estimated probabilities of occupation in each state were 6% (95% CI 3–14) for state 1, 18% (11–28) for state 2, 45% (35–56) for state 3, and 31% (22–42) for state 4. 35 (42%) patients had major bleeding and four (5%) had a haemorrhagic stroke.\n\n 30 patients died.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe estimated 60-day survival of ECMO-rescued patients with COVID-19 was similar to that of studies published in the past 2 years on ECMO for severe

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),

rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

(CT) examinations performed at admission and to provide a comprehensive radiological literature review on ongoing radiological data from recent publications.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nIn this retrospective single-center study, we enrolled consecutive patients from February 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized in Valduce Hospital (Como, Italy).\n\n Multi-modality imaging findings were evaluated and compared.\n\n Literature research was conducted through a methodical search on Pubmed and Embase databases.\n\n\nResults\nFifty-eight patients (36 men, 22 women; age range, 18–98 years) were included in the study.\n\n Among these, chest US, CXR, and CT were performed respectively in twenty-two, thirty-two and forty-two patients.\n\n Lung US findings were consistent with diffuse B lines (100%) and subpleural consolidations (27.3%).\n\n CXR showed prevalent manifestations of consolidations (46.9%) and hazy increased opacities (37.5%).\n\n Typical CT features included bilateral and multilobar ground-glass opacities (GGO) with (59.5%) and without (35.7%) consolidations having a predominantly peripheral distribution (64.3%).\n\n Other imaging features included crazy paving pattern (57.1%), fibrous stripes (50%), subpleural lines (35.7%), architectural distortion (28.6%), air bronchogram sign (26.2%), vascular thickening (23.8%) and nodules (2.4%).\n\n Also, enlarged lymph nodes (14.3 %) and pleural effusion (7.1%) were observed.\n\n The literature review identified twenty-six original studies supporting our imaging chest findings.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe spectrum of chest imaging manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia upon admission includes B-lines and consolidations on US, consolidations and hazy increased opacities on

Characteristics of patients with and without bleeding complications, as per the Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation (ELSO) definition, were compared, and the impact of bleeding complications on patient outcomes was assessed using survival analysis.\n\n Variables that were independently associated with bleeding, including daily clinical and biological variables during ECMO courses, were modelled.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 149 ECMO episodes (111 VA ECMO and 38 VV ECMO) performed in 147 adults, 89 episodes (60 %) were complicated by at least one bleeding event.\n\n The most common bleeding sources were: ECMO cannula (37 %), haemothorax or cardiac tamponade (17 %) and ear–nose and throat (16 %).\n\n Intra-cranial haemorrhage occurred in five (2.2 %) patients.\n\n Bleeding complications were independently associated with worse survival [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.17, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.07–4.41, P = 0.03].\n\n Higher activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.00, 95 % CI 1.64–5.47, P &lt; 0.01], APACHE III score [adjusted OR 1.01, 95 % CI 1.01–1.02, P = 0.01] and ECMO following surgery [adjusted OR 3.04, 95 % CI 1.62–5.69, P &lt; 0.01] were independently associated with greater risk of bleeding occurrence.\n\n A similar association between bleeding and higher aPTT was found when non-post-surgical VA ECMO was considered separately.\n\n\nConclusions\nBleeding events based on the ELSO bleeding definition occurred in more than 60 % of ECMO episodes and were associated with hospital mortality.\n\n We identified higher

impact of PRISMA endorsement on the quality of reporting and methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published in journals in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology (GH).\n\n\nMethods\nQuality of reporting and methodological quality were evaluated by assessing the adherence of papers to PRISMA checklist and AMSTAR quality scale.\n\n After identifying the GH journals which endorsed PRISMA in instructions for authors (IA), we appraised: 15 papers published in 2012 explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group A); 15 papers from the same journals published in 2012 not explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group B); 30 papers published the year preceding PRISMA endorsement from the same journals as above (Group C); 30 papers published in 2012 on the 10 highest impact factor journals in GH which not endorsed PRISMA (Group D).\n\n\nResults\nPRISMA statement was referred in the IA in 9 out of 70 GH journals (12.9%).\n\n We found significant increase in overall adherence to PRISMA checklist (Group A, 90.1%; Group C, 83.1%; p?=?0.003) and compliance to AMSTAR scale (Group A, 85.0%; Group C, 74.6%; p?=?0.002), following the

oxygenation (ECMO) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.\n\n However, the predictors of ICH in this patient category are poorly understood.\n\n The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of ICH in ECMO-treated adult patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a retrospective review of adult patients (?18 years) treated with ECMO at the Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden) between September 2005 and June 2016, excluding patients with ICH upon admission or those who were treated with ECMO for less than 12 h.\n\n In a comparative analysis, the primary end-points were the difference in baseline characteristics and predictors of hemorrhage occurrence (ICH vs.\n\n non-ICH cohorts).\n\n The secondary end-point was difference in mortality between groups.\n\n Paired testing and uni- and multivariate regression models were applied.\n\n\nResults\nTwo hundred and fifty-three patients were included, of which 54 (21%) experienced an ICH during ECMO treatment.\n\n The mortality for patients with ICH was 81% at 1 month and 85% at 6 months, respectively, compared to 28 and 33% in patients who did not develop ICH.\n\n When comparing ICH vs.\n\n non-ICH cohorts, pre-admission antithrombotic therapy (p?=?0.018), high pre-cannulation Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) coagulation score (p?=?0.015), low platelet count (p?&lt;?0.001), and spontaneous extracranial hemorrhage (p?=?0.045) were predictors of ICH.\n\n In a multivariate regression model predicting ICH, pre-admission antithrombotic therapy and low platelet count demonstrated independent risk association.\n\n When comparing the temporal trajectories for coagulation variables in the days leading up to the detection of an ICH, plasma antithrombin significantly increased per patient over time (p?=?0.014).\n\n No other temporal trajectories were found.\n\n\nConclusions\nICH in adult ECMO patients is associated with a high mortality rate and independently associated with pre-admission antithrombotic therapy and low platelet count, thus highlighting important areas of potential treatment strategies to prevent ICH development.\n\n\nElectronic

therapy is associated with high risk of neurologic injury.\n\n But the mechanism of neurologic injury during and/or after ECMO therapy is still unclear.\n\n Recent animal experiments confirmed that ECMO treatment increases the immune inflammatory response.\n\n The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of VV- ECMO on immune inflammatory response of cerebral tissues and neurological impairment.\n\n\nMethods\n18 porcine were randomly divided into control, sham and ECMO group (n?=?6/group).\n\n ECMO was run 24 h in the ECMO group, and serum collected at 0, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h during ECMO treatment for the analysis of cytokine (IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a) and cerebral injury specific biomarker S100B and NSE.\n\n After 24 h ECMO treatment, all animals were euthanized and cerebral tissues (hypothalamus, hippocampus and cortex) were collected for measure of mRNA and protein levels of cytokine (IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a).\n\n\nResults\nThe results during ECMO treatment showed that all the pro-inflammation cytokines were increased significantly after 2 h, and anti-inflammation IL-10 showed transient hoist in the first 2 h in serum.\n\n After 24 h ECMO therapy, the mRNA levels of pro-inflammation cytokines and anti-inflammation IL-10 were simultaneously up-regulated in cerebral tissues (hypothalamus, hippocampus and cortex).\n\n And protein concentrations also showed different increasing levels in cerebral tissues.\n\n However, during the ECMO treatment, S100B and NSE protein in serum did not change significantly.\n\n\nConclusion\nThese findings suggest VV-ECMO treatment can not only lead to immune inflammatory response in blood, but can also produce immune and inflammatory response in cerebral tissues.\n\n However the extent of immune inflammation was not sufficient to cause significant neurological impairment in this study.\n\n But the correlation between cerebral inflammatory response and cerebral impairment need to further explore.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3766192","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qiyi","surname":"Chen","email":"Qiyichen2008@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wenkui","surname":"Yu","email":"yudrnj@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiangliang","surname":"Shi","email":"shijl126@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juanhong","surname":"Shen","email":"medcc.sjh@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yimin","surname":"Hu","email":"guyueym@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Gao","email":"taogao1983@yahoo.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangjuanjuandoctor@126.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengchan","surname":"Xi","email":"xifengchan@yahoo.com.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianfeng","surname":"Gong","email":"jianfenggong@yahoo.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jieshou","surname":"Li","email":"jieshoulivip@sina.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Li","email":"NingLinju@hotmail.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/bja/48.8.719","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Physiology

in patients with acute brain injury","abstract":"Daily interruption of sedative therapy and limitation of deep sedation have been shown in several randomized trials to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay, and to improve the outcome of critically ill patients.\n However, patients with severe acute brain injury (ABI; including subjects with coma after traumatic brain injury, ischaemic/haemorrhagic stroke, cardiac arrest, status epilepticus) were excluded from these studies.\n Therefore, whether the new paradigm of minimal sedation can be translated to the neuro-ICU (NICU) is unclear.\n In patients with ABI, sedation has ‘general’ indications (control of anxiety, pain, discomfort, agitation, facilitation of mechanical ventilation) and ‘neuro-specific’ indications (reduction of cerebral metabolic demand, improved brain tolerance to ischaemia).\n Sedation also is an essential therapeutic component of intracranial pressure therapy, targeted temperature management and seizure control.\n Given the lack of large trials which have evaluated clinically relevant endpoints, sedative selection depends on the effect of each agent on cerebral and systemic haemodynamics.\n Titration and withdrawal of sedation in the NICU setting has to be balanced between the risk that interrupting sedation might exacerbate brain injury (e.\ng.\n intracranial pressure elevation) and the potential benefits of enhanced neurological function and reduced complications.\n In this review, we provide a concise summary of cerebral physiologic effects of sedatives and analgesics, the advantages/disadvantages of each agent, the comparative effects of standard sedatives (propofol and midazolam) and the emerging role of alternative drugs (ketamine).\n We suggest a pragmatic approach for the use of sedation-analgesia in the NICU, focusing on some practical aspects, including optimal titration and management of sedation withdrawal according to ABI severity.\n","id":"PMC4857238","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mauro","surname":"Oddo","email":"mauro.oddo@chuv.ch","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ilaria

progression is a common and devastating condition following traumatic brain injury (TBI), stressing the need for new diagnostic techniques.\n\n Multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) measures platelet function and could aid in coagulopathy assessment following TBI.\n\n The aims of this study were to evaluate MEA temporal dynamics, influence of concomitant therapy, and its capabilities to predict lesion progression and clinical outcome in a TBI cohort.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\nAdult TBI patients in a neurointensive care unit that underwent MEA sampling were retrospectively included.\n\n MEA was sampled if the patient was treated with antiplatelet therapy, bled heavily during surgery, or had abnormal baseline coagulation values.\n\n We assessed platelet activation pathways involving the arachidonic acid receptor (ASPI), P2Y12 receptor, and thrombin receptor (TRAP).\n\n ASPI was the primary focus of analysis.\n\n If several samples were obtained, they were included.\n\n Retrospective data were extracted from hospital charts.\n\n Outcome variables were radiologic hemorrhagic progression and Glasgow Outcome Scale assessed prospectively at 12?months posttrauma.\n\n MEA levels were compared between patients on antiplatelet therapy.\n\n Linear mixed effect models and uni-/multivariable regression models were used to study longitudinal dynamics, hemorrhagic progression and outcome, respectively.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 178 patients were included (48% unfavorable outcome).\n\n ASPI levels increased from initially low values in a time-dependent fashion (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Patients on cyclooxygenase inhibitors demonstrated low ASPI levels (p?&lt;?0.001), while platelet transfusion increased them (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n The first ASPI (p?=?0.039) and TRAP (p?=?0.009) were

general longitudinal trend of MEA is identified in this TBI cohort, even in patients without known antiplatelet therapies.\n\n Values appear also affected by platelet inhibitory treatment and by platelet transfusions.\n\n While significant in univariate models to predict outcome, MEA values did not independently correlate to outcome or lesion progression in multivariable analyses.\n\n Further prospective studies to monitor coagulation in TBI patients are warranted, in particular the interpretation of pathological MEA values in patients without antiplatelet

hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), and neurofilament light (NF-L) have been serially sampled in serum of patients suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI) in order to assess injury severity and tissue fate.\n\n We review the current literature of serum level dynamics of these proteins following TBI and used the term “effective half-life” (t1/2) in order to describe the “fall” rate in serum.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nThrough searches on EMBASE, Medline, and Scopus, we looked for articles where these proteins had been serially sampled in serum in human TBI.\n\n We excluded animal studies, studies with only one presented sample and studies without neuroradiological examinations.\n\n\nResults\nFollowing screening (10,389 papers), n?=?122 papers were included.\n\n The proteins S100B (n?=?66) and NSE (n?=?27) were the two most frequent biomarkers that were serially sampled.\n\n For S100B in severe TBI, a majority of studies indicate a t1/2 of about 24?h, even if very early sampling in these patients reveals rapid decreases (1–2?h) though possibly of non-cerebral origin.\n\n In contrast, the t1/2 for NSE is comparably longer, ranging from 48 to 72?h in severe TBI cases.\n\n The protein GFAP (n?=?18) appears to have t1/2 of about 24–48?h in severe TBI.\n\n The protein UCH-L1 (n?=?9) presents a t1/2 around 7?h in mild TBI and about 10?h in severe.\n\n Frequent sampling of these proteins revealed different trajectories with persisting high serum levels, or secondary peaks, in patients with unfavorable outcome or in patients developing secondary detrimental events.\n\n Finally, NF-L (n?=?2) only increased in the few studies available, suggesting a serum availability of &gt;10?days.\n\n To date, automated assays are available for S100B and NSE making them faster and more practical to use.\n\n\nConclusion\nSerial sampling of brain-specific proteins in serum reveals different temporal trajectories that should be acknowledged.\n\n Proteins with shorter serum availability, like S100B, may be superior to proteins such as NF-L in detection of secondary harmful events when monitoring patients with TBI.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5494601","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Eric Peter","surname":"Thelin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick

intracranial pressure (ICP) has prevented their use in many clinical situations.\n\n Several attempts have been made to develop methods to monitor ICP non-invasively.\n\n The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between ultrasound-based non-invasive ICP (nICP) and invasive ICP measurement in neurocritical care patients.\n\n\nMethods and findings\nThis was a prospective, single-cohort observational study of patients admitted to a tertiary neurocritical care unit.\n\n Patients with brain injury requiring invasive ICP monitoring were considered for inclusion.\n\n nICP was assessed using optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), venous transcranial Doppler (vTCD) of straight sinus systolic flow velocity (FVsv), and methods derived from arterial transcranial Doppler (aTCD) on the middle cerebral artery (MCA): MCA pulsatility index (PIa) and an estimator based on diastolic flow velocity (FVd).\n\n A total of 445 ultrasound examinations from 64 patients performed from 1 January to 1 November 2016 were included.\n\n The median age of the patients was 53 years (range 37–64).\n\n Median Glasgow Coma Scale at admission was 7 (range 3–14), and median Glasgow Outcome Scale was 3 (range 1–5).\n\n The mortality rate was 20%.\n\n ONSD and FVsv demonstrated the strongest correlation with ICP (R = 0.76 for ONSD versus ICP; R = 0.72 for FVsv versus ICP), whereas PIa and the estimator based on FVd did not correlate with ICP significantly.\n\n Combining the 2 strongest nICP predictors (ONSD and FVsv) resulted in an even stronger correlation with ICP (R = 0.80).\n\n The ability to detect intracranial hypertension (ICP ? 20 mm Hg) was highest for ONSD (area under the curve [AUC] 0.91, 95% CI 0.88–0.95).\n\n The combination of ONSD and FVsv methods showed a statistically significant improvement of AUC values compared with the ONSD method alone (0.93, 95% CI 0.90–0.97, p = 0.01).\n\n Major limitations are the heterogeneity and small number of patients included in this study, the need for specialised training to perform and interpret the ultrasound tests, and the variability in performance among different ultrasound operators.\n\n\nConclusions\nOf the studied ultrasound nICP methods, ONSD is the best estimator of ICP.\n\n The novel combination of ONSD ultrasonography and vTCD of the straight sinus is a promising and easily available technique for identifying critically ill patients with intracranial hypertension.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5526499","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chiara","surname":"Robba","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Danilo","surname":"Cardim","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Danilo","surname":"Cardim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tamara","surname":"Tajsic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Justine","surname":"Pietersen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Bulman","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Bulman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Donnelly","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrea","surname":"Lavinio","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Andrea","surname":"Lavinio","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Arun","surname":"Gupta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David

to characterise the epidemiology, hospital course, and outcomes of patients aged 16 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 who had ECMO support initiated between Jan 16 and May 1, 2020, at 213 hospitals in 36 countries.\n\n The primary outcome was in-hospital death in a time-to-event analysis assessed at 90 days after ECMO initiation.\n\n We applied a multivariable Cox model to examine whether patient and hospital factors were associated with in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nData for 1035 patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO support were included in this study.\n\n Of these, 67 (6%) remained hospitalised, 311 (30%) were discharged home or to an acute rehabilitation centre, 101 (10%) were discharged to a long-term acute care centre or unspecified location, 176 (17%) were discharged to another hospital, and 380 (37%) died.\n\n The estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 37·4% (95% CI 34·4–40·4).\n\n Mortality was 39% (380 of 968) in patients with a final disposition of death or hospital discharge.\n\n The use of ECMO for circulatory support was independently associated with higher in-hospital

pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.\n\n Despite recognition of differential hypoxia and attempts to deliver more oxygenated blood to the upper body, the mechanism of differential hypoxia as well as prevention strategies have not been well investigated.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used a sheep model of acute respiratory failure that was supported with femoral VA ECMO from the inferior vena cava to the femoral artery (IVC-FA), ECMO from the superior vena cava to the FA (SVC-FA), ECMO from the IVC to the carotid artery (IVC-CA) and ECMO with an additional return cannula to the internal jugular vein based on the femoral VA ECMO (FA-IJV).\n\n Angiography and blood gas analyses were performed.\n\n\nResults\nWith IVC-FA, blood oxygen saturation (SO2) of the IVC (83.6?±?0.8%) was higher than that of the SVC (40.3?±?1.0%).\n\n Oxygen-rich blood was drained back to the ECMO circuit and poorly oxygenated blood in the SVC entered the right atrium (RA).\n\n SVC-FA achieved oxygen-rich blood return from the IVC to the RA without shifting the arterial cannulation.\n\n Subsequently, SO2 of the SVC and the pulmonary artery increased (70.4?±?1.0% and 73.4?±?1.1%, respectively).\n\n Compared with IVC-FA, a lesser difference in venous oxygen return and attenuated differential hypoxia were observed with IVC-CA and FA-IJV.\n\n\nConclusions\nDifferential venous

Cannula Positioning in Arterial Deoxygenation During Veno?Arterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation—A Simulation Study and Case Report","abstract":"Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA?ECMO) is indicated in reversible life?threatening circulatory failure with or without respiratory failure.\n Arterial desaturation in the upper body is frequently seen in patients with peripheral arterial cannulation and severe respiratory failure.\n The importance of venous cannula positioning was explored in a computer simulation model and a clinical case was described.\n A closed?loop real?time simulation model has been developed including vascular segments, the heart with valves and pericardium.\n ECMO was simulated with a fixed flow pump and a selection of clinically relevant venous cannulation sites.\n A clinical case with no tidal volumes due to pneumonia and an arterial saturation of below 60% in the right hand despite VA?ECMO flow of 4 L/min was described.\n The case was compared with simulation data.\n Changing the venous cannulation site from the inferior to the superior caval vein increased arterial saturation in the right arm from below 60% to above 80% in the patient and from 64 to 81% in the simulation model without changing ECMO flow.\n The patient survived, was extubated and showed no signs of hypoxic damage.\n We conclude that venous drainage from the superior caval vein improves upper body arterial saturation during veno?arterial ECMO as compared with drainage solely from the inferior caval vein in patients with respiratory failure.\n The results from the simulation model are in agreement with the clinical scenario.\n","id":"PMC5297996","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mattias","surname":"Lindfors","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Björn","surname":"Frenckner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ulrik","surname":"Sartipy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Bjällmark","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Broomé","email":"michael.broome@karolinska.se","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s13054-018-2083-0","date":"2018-05-24","title":"Position

(ARDS), adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may decrease ventilator-induced lung injury by minimising overinflation and cyclic recruitment-derecruitment of the lung.\n\n We evaluated whether setting the PEEP using decremental PEEP titration after an alveolar recruitment manoeuvre (ARM) affects the clinical outcome in patients with ARDS.\n\n\nMethods\nFifty-seven patients with early ARDS were randomly assigned to a group given decremental PEEP titration following ARM or a table-based PEEP (control) group.\n\n PEEP and inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) in the control group were set according to the table-based combinations of FiO2 and PEEP of the ARDS network, by which we aimed to achieve a PEEP level compatible with an oxygenation target.\n\n In the decremental PEEP titration group, the oxygen saturation and static compliance were monitored as the patients performed the ARM along with the extended sigh method, which is designed to gradually apply and withdraw a high distending pressure over a prolonged period, and the decremental titration of PEEP.\n\n\nResults\nThe baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the control and decremental PEEP titration groups.\n\n Initial oxygenation improved more in the decremental PEEP titration group than in the control group.\n\n However, dynamic compliance, tidal volume and PEEP were similar in the two groups during the first week.\n\n The duration of use of paralysing or sedative agents, mechanical ventilation, stay in the intensive care unit and mortality at 28 days did not differ significantly between the decremental PEEP titration and control groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe daily decremental PEEP titration after ARM showed only initial oxygenation improvement compared with the

plateau pressure minimisation are the standard components of a protective lung ventilation strategy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n Open lung strategies, including higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment manoeuvres to date have not proven efficacious.\n\n This study examines the effectiveness and safety of a novel open lung strategy, which includes permissive hypercapnia, staircase recruitment manoeuvres (SRM) and low airway pressure with PEEP titration.\n\n\nMethod\nTwenty ARDS patients were randomised to treatment or ARDSnet control ventilation strategies.\n\n The treatment group received SRM with decremental PEEP titration and targeted plateau pressure &lt; 30 cm H2O.\n\n Gas exchange and lung compliance were measured daily for 7 days and plasma cytokines in the first 24 hours and on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 (mean ± SE).\n\n Duration of ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay (median and interquartile range) and hospital survival

treatment group over the seven-day period (ratio 1.41 (1.11 to 1.79), P = 0.01), while for TNF-? the control group was 20% higher over the seven-day period (ratio 1.20 (1.01 to 1.42) P = 0.05).\n\n

Research","abstract":"Ventilator-free days (VFDs) are a commonly reported composite outcome measure in acute respiratory distress syndrome trials.\n VFDs combine survival and duration of ventilation in a manner that summarizes the “net effect” of an intervention on these two outcomes.\n However, this combining of outcome measures makes VFDs difficult to understand and analyze, which contributes to imprecise interpretations.\n We discuss the strengths and limitations of VFDs and other “failure-free day” composites, and we provide a framework for when and how to use these outcome measures.\n We also provide a comprehensive discussion of the different analytic methods for analyzing and interpreting VFDs, including Student’s t tests and rank-sum tests, as well as competing risk regressions treating extubation as the primary outcome and death as the competing risk.\n Using simulations, we illustrate how the statistical test with optimal power depends on the relative contributions of mortality and ventilator duration on the composite effect size.\n Finally, we recommend a simple analysis and reporting framework using the competing risk approach, which provides clear information on the effect size of an intervention, a statistical test and measure of confidence with the ability to adjust for baseline factors and allow interim monitoring for trials.\n We emphasize that any approach to analyzing a composite outcome, including other “failure-free day” constructs, should also be accompanied by an examination of the

PRISM score prior to NB-BAL, observations at the time of NB-BAL and arterial blood gases, oxygenation index (OI), ventilator settings, haemodynamic variables and temperature taken at 1 h before, and 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL, were retrieved from the archived computerised database.\n Results: Median age was 7 months (IQR 2.8–43 months) and median weight was 5.5 kg (IQR 4–14 kg).\n Four (7%) patients exhibited significant immediate complications, requiring escalation of respiratory or haemodynamic support.\n Forty-two (70%) patients had complete data for calculation of OI; there was no significant change in median OI at 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL.\n However 5 (12%) of these patients experienced an increase in OI of between 10 and 45 at 1 h post NB-BAL, which returned to baseline at 6 h post NB-BAL.\n Complications did not correlate with any of the available variables: baseline OI, PRISM score or with deterioration at the time of the procedure, although it was observed that four out of the six patients with baseline OIs of greater than 20 experienced complications.\n Conclusion: Non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage in critically ill mechanically ventilated neonates and children is generally a well-tolerated procedure, but for some patients, in whom it was not possible to elucidate predictive factors, complications developed.\n All patients, particularly those with OIs of greater than 20, require careful monitoring during and after the procedure.\n","id":"PMC7095174","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Margarita","surname":"Burmester","email":"margivan@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Quen","surname":"Mok","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1097/PCC.0000000000000435","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nonpulmonary Treatments for Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Proceedings From the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1542/peds.2008-1987","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Functional Status Scale: new pediatric outcome measure","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3389/fped.2016.00051","date":"2016-05-02","title":"Relevant Outcomes in Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Studies","abstract":"Despite distinct epidemiology and outcomes, pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is often managed based on evidence extrapolated from treatment of adults.\n The impact of non-pulmonary processes on mortality as well as the lower mortality rate compared to adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) renders the utilization of short-term mortality as a primary outcome measure for interventional studies problematic.\n However, data regarding alternatives to mortality are profoundly understudied, and proposed alternatives, such as ventilator-free days, may be themselves subject to hidden biases.\n Given the neuropsychiatric and functional impairment in adult survivors of ARDS, characterization of these morbidities in children with PARDS is of paramount importance.\n The purpose of this review is to frame these challenges in the context of the existing pediatric literature, and using adult ARDS as a guide, suggest potential clinically relevant outcomes that deserve further investigation.\n The goal is to identify important areas of study in order to better define clinical practice and facilitate future interventional trials in PARDS.\n","id":"PMC4865511","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nadir","surname":"Yehya","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neal J.","surname":"Thomas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/thorax.55.7.587","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pediatric origins of adult lung disease. 1.

pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, compared to those who are moderately ill.\n The high level of cytokines also indicates a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Besides, excessive infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells, mainly involving macrophages and T-helper 17 cells, has been found in lung tissues of patients with COVID-19 by postmortem examination.\n Recently, increasing studies indicate that the “cytokine storm” may contribute to the mortality of COVID-19. Here, we summarize the clinical and pathologic features of the cytokine storm in COVID-19. Our review shows that SARS-Cov-2 selectively induces a high level of IL-6 and results in the exhaustion of lymphocytes.\n The current evidence indicates that tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, is relatively effective and safe.\n Besides, corticosteroids, programmed cell death protein (PD)-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition, cytokine-adsorption devices, intravenous immunoglobulin, and antimalarial agents could be potentially useful and reliable approaches to counteract cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.\n","id":"PMC7365923","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yujun","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiajia","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dingyi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhenghao","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jinjun","surname":"Ji","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chengping","surname":"Wen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.05.001","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Recognizing COVID-19–related myocarditis: The possible pathophysiology and proposed guideline for diagnosis and management","abstract":"Human coronavirus-associated myocarditis is known, and a number of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)–related myocarditis cases have been reported.\n The pathophysiology of COVID-19–related myocarditis is thought to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage due to the host’s immune response.\n COVID-19 myocarditis diagnosis should be guided by insights from previous coronavirus and other myocarditis experience.\n The clinical findings include changes in electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers, and impaired cardiac function.\n When cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is not feasible, cardiac computed tomographic angiography with delayed myocardial imaging may serve to exclude significant coronary artery disease and identify myocardial inflammatory patterns.\n Because many COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities, myocardial infarction should be considered.\n If the diagnosis remains uncertain, an endomyocardial biopsy may help identify active cardiac infection through viral genome amplification and possibly refine the treatment risks of systemic immunosuppression.\n Arrhythmias are not uncommon in COVID-19 patients, but the pathophysiology is still speculative.\n Nevertheless, clinicians should be vigilant to provide prompt monitoring and treatment.\n The long-term impact of COVID-19 myocarditis, including the majority of mild cases, remains unknown.\n","id":"PMC7199677","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Bhurint","surname":"Siripanthong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saman","surname":"Nazarian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniele","surname":"Muser","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rajat","surname":"Deo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pasquale","surname":"Santangeli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohammed Y.","surname":"Khanji","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leslie T.","surname":"Cooper","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"C.

review to assess the determinants and disease spectrum of COVID-19 reinfection.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nA comprehensive search covering relevant databases was conducted for observational studies reporting Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) confirmed infection and reinfection cases.\n\n A quality assessment tool developed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) for the assessment of case series was utilized.\n\n Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 for pooled proportions of findings in first infection and reinfection with a 95% confidence interval (CI).\n\n\nResults\nEighty-one studies reporting 577 cases were included from 22 countries.\n\n The mean age of patients was 46.2 ± 18.9 years and 179 (31.0%) cases of comorbidities were reported.\n\n The average time duration between first infection and reinfection was 63.6 ± 48.9 days.\n\n During first infection and reinfection, fever was the most common symptom (41.4% and 36.4%, respectively) whilst anti-viral therapy was the most common treatment regimen administered (44.5% and 43.0%, respectively).\n\n Comparable odds of symptomatic presentation and management were reported for the two infections.\n\n However, a higher Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rate was observed in reinfection compared to first infection (10 vs 3).\n\n Ten deaths were reported with respiratory failure being the most common cause of death (7/10 deaths).\n\n\nConclusion\nOur findings support immunization practices given increased ICU admissions and mortality in reinfections.\n\n Our cohort serves as a guide for clinicians and

(COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still not fully unraveled.\n Though preventive vaccines and treatment methods are out on the market, a specific cure for the disease has not been discovered.\n Recent investigations and research studies primarily focus on the immunopathology of the disease.\n A healthy immune system responds immediately after viral entry, causing immediate viral annihilation and recovery.\n However, an impaired immune system causes extensive systemic damage due to an unregulated immune response characterized by the hypersecretion of chemokines and cytokines.\n The elevated levels of cytokine or hypercytokinemia leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) along with multiple organ damage.\n Moreover, the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 has been linked with race, gender, and age; hence, this viral infection’s outcome differs among the patients.\n Many therapeutic strategies focusing on immunomodulation have been tested out to assuage the cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the diverse signaling pathways triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is essential before contemplating relief measures.\n This present review explains the interrelationships of hyperinflammatory response or cytokine storm with organ damage and the disease severity.\n Furthermore, we have thrown light on the diverse mechanisms and risk factors that influence pathogenesis and the molecular pathways that lead to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and multiple organ damage.\n Recognition of altered pathways of a dysregulated immune system can be a loophole to identify potential target markers.\n Identifying biomarkers in the dysregulated pathway can aid in better clinical management for patients with severe COVID-19 disease.\n A special focus has also been given to potent inhibitors of proinflammatory cytokines, immunomodulatory and immunotherapeutic options to ameliorate cytokine storm and inflammatory responses in patients affected with COVID-19.

we aimed to determine whether continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with oXiris filter may alleviate cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in non-AKI patients with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n A total of 17 non-AKI patients with severe and critical COVID-19 treated between February 14 and March 26, 2020 were included and randomly divided into intervention group and control group according to the random number table.\n Patients in the intervention group immediately received CRRT with oXiris filter plus conventional treatment, while those in the control group only received conventional treatment.\n Demographic data were collected and collated at admission.\n During ICU hospitalization, the concentrations of circulating cytokines and inflammatory chemokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-?, and IFN-?, were quantitatively measured daily to reflect the degree of CRS induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Clinical data, including the severity of COVID-19 white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil proportion (NEUT%), lymphocyte count (LYMPH), lymphocyte percentage (LYM%), platelet (PLT), C-reaction protein (CRP), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TB), albumin (ALB), serum creatinine (SCr), D-Dimer, fibrinogen (FIB), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-?, IFN-?, number of hospital days and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were obtained and collated from medical records, and then compared between the two groups.\n Age, and SCr significantly differed between the two groups.\n Besides the IL-2 concentration that was significantly lower on day 2 than that on day 1 in the intervention group, and the IL-6 concentrations that were significantly higher on day 1, and day 2 in the intervention group compared to the control group, similar to the IL-10 concentration on day 5, there were no significant differences between the two groups.\n To sum up, CRRT with oXiris filter may not effectively alleviate CRS in non-AKI patients with severe and critical COVID-19.

patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial.\n\n We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on ECMO for H1N1-associated ALI.\n\n\nMethods\nCENTRAL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus (updated 2 January 2012) were systematically searched.\n\n Studies reporting on 10 or more patients with H1N1 infection treated with ECMO were included.\n\n Baseline, procedural, outcome and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled, when appropriate, with random-effect methods.\n\n\nResults\nFrom 1,196 initial citations, 8 studies were selected, including 1,357 patients with confirmed/suspected H1N1 infection requiring intensive care unit admission, 266 (20%) of whom were treated with ECMO.\n\n Patients had a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 9, and had received mechanical ventilation before ECMO implementation for a median of two days.\n\n ECMO was implanted before inter-hospital patient transfer in 72% of cases and in most patients (94%) the veno-venous configuration was used.\n\n ECMO was maintained for a median of 10 days.\n\n Outcomes were highly variable

surge worldwide, an urgent need exists to enhance our understanding of the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of severely ill patients with COVID-19 who develop acute respiratory and cardiac compromise refractory to conventional therapy.\n The purpose of this manuscript is to review our initial clinical experience in 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with ECMO.\n A multi-institutional registry and database was created and utilized to assess all patients who were supported with ECMO provided by SpecialtyCare.\n Data captured included patient characteristics, pre-COVID-19 risk factors and comorbidities, confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis, features of ECMO support, specific medications utilized to treat COVID-19, and short-term outcomes through hospital discharge.\n This analysis includes all of our patients with COVID-19 supported with ECMO, with an analytic window starting March 17, 2020, when our first COVID-19 patient was placed on ECMO, and ending April 9, 2020. During the 24 days of this study, 32 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were placed on ECMO at nine different hospitals.\n As of the time of analysis, 17 remain on ECMO, 10 died before or shortly after decannulation, and five are alive and extubated after removal from ECMO, with one of these five discharged from the hospital.\n Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: four of five survivors received intravenous steroids, three of five survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), two of five survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and one of five survivors received hydroxychloroquine.\n An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19. Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n These initial data may provide useful information to help define the best strategies to care for these challenging patients and may also provide a framework for much-needed future research about the use of ECMO to treat patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7217117","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jeffrey P.","surname":"Jacobs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alfred H.","surname":"Stammers","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James","surname":"St. Louis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.

allows us to provide this life-saving therapy to our sickest patients without overburdening already stretched resources or excessively exposing healthcare staff to infection risk.\n\n\nMethods:\nAs a major regional referral program, we used the framework of our well-established ECMO service-line to outline specific team structures, modified patient eligibility criteria, cannulation strategies, and management protocols for the COVID-19 ECMO program.\n\n\nResults:\nDuring the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts, 6 patients were placed on VV ECMO for refractory hypoxemic

University Hospital Network, comprising five intensive care units (ICUs) and included patients who received ECMO for COVID-19 associated ARDS.\n\n Patient demographics and daily pre-ECMO and on-ECMO

membrane oxygenation support in COVID-19: an international cohort study of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry","abstract":"Background\nMultiple major health organisations recommend the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure.\n\n However, initial reports of ECMO use in patients with COVID-19 described very high mortality and there have been no large, international cohort studies of ECMO for COVID-19 reported to date.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry to characterise the epidemiology, hospital course, and outcomes of patients aged 16 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 who had ECMO support initiated between Jan 16 and May 1, 2020, at 213 hospitals in 36 countries.\n\n The primary outcome was in-hospital death in a time-to-event analysis assessed at 90 days after ECMO initiation.\n\n We applied a multivariable Cox model to examine whether patient and hospital factors were associated with in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nData for 1035 patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO support were included in this study.\n\n Of these, 67 (6%) remained hospitalised, 311 (30%) were discharged home or to an acute rehabilitation centre, 101 (10%) were discharged to a long-term acute care centre or unspecified location, 176 (17%) were discharged to another hospital, and 380 (37%) died.\n\n The estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 37·4% (95% CI 34·4–40·4).\n\n Mortality was 39% (380 of 968) in patients with a final disposition of death or hospital discharge.\n\n The use of ECMO for circulatory support was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 1·89, 95% CI 1·20–2·97).\n\n In the subset of patients with COVID-19 receiving respiratory (venovenous) ECMO and characterised as having acute respiratory distress syndrome, the estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 38·0% (95% CI 34·6–41·5).\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO, both estimated mortality 90 days after ECMO and mortality in those with a final disposition of death or discharge were less than 40%.\n\n These data from 213 hospitals worldwide provide a generalisable estimate of ECMO mortality in the setting of COVID-19.\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7518880","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ryan

extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other modalities of mechanical cardiopulmonary support are increasingly being utilized in the treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure refractory to conventional management, their role and efficacy as support modalities in the present pandemic are unclear.\n We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and

On ICU admission, standard oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, and non-invasive ventilation were applied to 29%, 19%, and 6% patients, respectively.\n\n 2635 (63%) patients were intubated during the

influenza can cause severe acute lung injury (ALI).\n\n Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support gas exchange in patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial.\n\n We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on ECMO for H1N1-associated ALI.\n\n\nMethods\nCENTRAL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus (updated 2 January 2012) were systematically searched.\n\n Studies reporting on 10 or more patients with H1N1 infection treated with ECMO were included.\n\n Baseline, procedural, outcome and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled, when appropriate, with random-effect methods.\n\n\nResults\nFrom 1,196 initial citations, 8 studies were selected, including 1,357 patients with confirmed/suspected H1N1 infection requiring intensive care unit admission, 266 (20%) of whom were treated with ECMO.\n\n Patients had a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 9, and had received mechanical ventilation before ECMO implementation for a median of two days.\n\n ECMO was implanted before inter-hospital patient transfer in 72% of cases and in most patients (94%) the veno-venous configuration was used.\n\n ECMO was maintained for a median of 10 days.\n\n Outcomes were highly variable among the included studies, with in-hospital or short-term mortality ranging between 8% and 65%, mainly depending on baseline patient features.\n\n Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality of 28% (95% confidence interval 18% to 37%; I2 = 64%).\n\n\nConclusions\nECMO is feasible and effective in patients with ALI due to H1N1 infection.\n\n Despite this, prolonged support (more than one week) is required in most cases, and subjects with severe comorbidities or multiorgan failure remain at high risk of in-hospital death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4057025","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alberto","surname":"Zangrillo","email":"zangrillo.alberto@hsr.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Biondi-Zoccai","email":"giuseppe.biondizoccai@uniroma1.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giovanni","surname":"Landoni","email":"landoni.giovanni@hsr.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giacomo","surname":"Frati","email":"giacomo.frati@uniroma1.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicolò","surname":"Patroniti","email":"nicolo.patroniti@unimib.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Pesenti","email":"antonio.pesenti@unimib.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Federico","surname":"Pappalardo","email":"pappalardo.federico@hsr.it","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.4103/0971-9784.197820","date":"2016-08-01","title":"Extracorporeal

associated mortality.\n\n This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize and pool outcomes data available in the published literature to guide clinical decision-making and further research.\n\n\nMethods:\nWe conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE (1966 to April 15, 2015), EMBASE (1980 to April 15, 2015), CENTRAL, and Google Scholar for patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and respiratory failure who received ECMO.\n\n The study validity was appraised by Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.\n\n The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.\n\n The secondary outcomes were duration of ECMO therapy, mechanical ventilation, and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay.\n\n\nResults:\nOf 698 abstracts screened and 142 full-text articles reviewed, we included 13 studies with a total of 494 patients receiving ECMO in our final review and meta-analysis.\n\n The study validity was satisfactory.\n\n The overall mortality was 37.1% (95% confidence interval: 30–45%) limited by underlying heterogeneity (I2 = 65%, P value of Q statistic = 0.006).\n\n The median duration for ECMO was 10 days, mechanical ventilation was 19 days, and ICU length of stay was 33 days.\n\n Exploratory meta-regression did not identify any statistically significant moderator of mortality (P &lt; 0.05), except for the duration of pre-ECMO mechanical ventilation in days (coefficient 0.19, standard error: 0.09, Z = 2.01, P &lt; 0.04, R2 = 0.16).\n\n The visual inspection of funnel plots did not suggest the presence of publication bias.\n\n\nConclusions:\nECMO therapy may be used as an adjunct or salvage therapy for severe H1N1 pneumonia with respiratory failure.\n\n It is associated with a prolonged duration of ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and high mortality.\n\n Initiating ECMO early once the patient has been instituted on mechanical ventilation may result in improved

have symptoms that rapidly evolve to profound hypoxaemia and death.\n\n The efficacy of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with severe ARDS in the context of COVID-19 is unclear.\n\n We aimed to establish the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with respiratory failure and COVID-19 treated with ECMO.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective cohort study was done in the Paris–Sorbonne University Hospital Network, comprising five intensive care units (ICUs) and included patients who received ECMO for COVID-19 associated ARDS.\n\n Patient demographics and daily pre-ECMO and on-ECMO data and outcomes were collected.\n\n Possible outcomes over time were categorised into four different states (states 1–4): on ECMO, in the ICU and weaned off ECMO, alive and out of ICU, or death.\n\n Daily probabilities of occupation in each state and of transitions between these states until day 90 post-ECMO onset were estimated with use of a multi-state Cox model stratified for each possible transition.\n\n Follow-up was right-censored on July 10, 2020.\nFindings\nFrom March 8 to May 2, 2020, 492 patients with COVID-19 were treated in our ICUs.\n\n Complete day-60 follow-up was available for 83 patients (median age 49 [IQR 41–56] years and 61 [73%] men) who received ECMO.\n\n Pre-ECMO, 78 (94%) patients had been prone-positioned; their median driving pressure was 18 (IQR 16–21) cm H2O and PaO2/FiO2 was 60 (54–68) mm Hg.\n\n At 60 days post-ECMO initiation, the estimated probabilities of occupation in each state were 6% (95% CI 3–14) for state 1, 18% (11–28) for state 2, 45% (35–56) for state 3, and 31% (22–42) for state 4. 35 (42%) patients had major bleeding and four (5%) had a haemorrhagic stroke.\n\n 30 patients died.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe estimated 60-day survival of ECMO-rescued patients with COVID-19 was similar to that of studies published in the past 2 years on ECMO for severe ARDS.\n\n If another COVID-19 outbreak occurs, ECMO should be considered for patients developing refractory respiratory failure despite optimised care.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7426089","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthieu","surname":"Schmidt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Hajage","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guillaume","surname":"Lebreton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Antoine","surname":"Monsel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guillaume","surname":"Voiriot","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Levy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elodie","surname":"Baron","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexandra","surname":"Beurton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juliette","surname":"Chommeloux","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paris","surname":"Meng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Safaa","surname":"Nemlaghi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Bay","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pascal","surname":"Leprince","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexandre","surname":"Demoule","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bertrand","surname":"Guidet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jean

ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Improved

patients.\n\n Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included.\n\n Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected.\n\n Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points).\n\n Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%).\n\n 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting.\n\n Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO.\n\n Most patients (&gt;?95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen.\n\n No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant.\n\n Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n?=?145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n?=?77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs.\n\n 2.1%, p?&lt;?0.008).\n\n Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications.\n\n Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary

COVID?19 has been recommended by some expert consensus because of the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation and venous thromboembolism.\n\n However, its efficacy remains to be validated.\n\n\nMethods\nCoagulation results, medications, and outcomes of consecutive patients being classified as having severe COVID?19 in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed.\n\n The 28?day mortality between heparin users and nonusers were compared, as was a different risk of coagulopathy, which was stratified by the sepsis?induced coagulopathy (SIC) score or D?dimer result.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 449 patients with severe COVID?19 enrolled into the study, 99 of them received heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin) for 7 days or longer.\n\n D?dimer, prothrombin time, and age were positively, and platelet count was negatively, correlated with 28?day mortality in multivariate analysis.\n\n No difference in 28?day mortality was found between heparin users and nonusers (30.3% vs 29.7%, P = .\n\n910).\n\n But the 28?day mortality of heparin users was lower than nonusers in patients with SIC score ?4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P = .\n\n029), or

disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) diagnostic criteria using antithrombin activity","abstract":"Background\nWith advances in the treatment of sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) has been losing its prognostic power.\n\n Since the SIRS category is no longer used for the diagnosis of sepsis, the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) diagnostic criteria released by Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) should be modified.\n\n Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the appropriateness of replacing the SIRS score with antithrombin activity in JAAM-DIC diagnostic criteria.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analyzed data from 819 septic patients who had received recombinant thrombomodulin.\n\n The relationships between the 28-day mortality rate and baseline laboratory and clinical parameters were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses, and the impact of replacing the SIRS criteria with antithrombin activity was evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nThe SIRS score, prothrombin time ratio, and antithrombin activity were associated with the 28-day mortality rate (P values?=?0.013, 0.018, and 0.003, respectively, by multivariate analysis).\n\n A modified version of the JAAM-DIC diagnostic criteria using an antithrombin activity &lt;70 % was capable of diagnosing the identical number (n?=?706) and a similar severity of patients (mortality, 34.6 % versus 34.8 %).\n\n\nConclusion\nSince anticoagulant therapy is expected to be more effective in patients with more severe coagulation disorders, the modified version of the JAAM-DIC diagnostic criteria might be useful for discriminating patients with sepsis who are good candidates for anticoagulant therapy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5024432","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Toshiaki","surname":"Iba","email":"toshiiba@cf6.so-net.ne.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marcello","surname":"Di

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a model pathogen.\n We utilized a time course of matched virologic, pathological, and transcriptomic data within a novel methodological framework that can detect pathway enrichment among key highly connected network genes.\n This unbiased approach produced a high-priority list of 4 genes in one pathway out of over 3,500 genes that were differentially expressed following SARS-CoV infection.\n With these data, we predicted that the urokinase and other wound repair pathways would regulate lethal versus sublethal disease following SARS-CoV infection in mice.\n We validated the importance of the urokinase pathway for SARS-CoV disease severity using genetically defined knockout mice, proteomic correlates of pathway activation, and pathological disease severity.\n The results of these studies demonstrate that a fine balance exists between host coagulation and fibrinolysin pathways regulating pathological disease outcomes, including diffuse alveolar

assess the long term outcome and quality of life of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for refractory hypoxemia.\n\n\nMethods\nA retrospective observational study with prospective health related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment was conducted in ARDS patients who had ECMO as a rescue therapy for reversible refractory hypoxemia from January 2009 until April 2011 in a tertiary Australian centre.\n\n Survival and long-term quality of life assessment, using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and the EuroQol health related quality of life questionnaire (EQ5D) were assessed and compared to international data from other research groups.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-one patients (mean age 36.3 years) with ARDS receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia were studied.\n\n Eighteen (86%) patients were retrieved from external intensive care units (ICUs) by a dedicated ECMO retrieval team.\n\n Eleven (55%) had H1N1 influenza A-associated pneumonitis.\n\n Eighteen (86%) patients survived to hospital discharge.\n\n Of the 18 survivors, ten (56%) were discharged to other hospitals and 8 (44%) were discharged directly home.\n\n Sequelae and health related quality of life were evaluated for 15 of the 18 (71%) long-term survivors (assessment at median 8 months).\n\n Mean SF-36 scores were significantly lower across all domains compared to age and sex matched Australian norms.\n\n Mean SF-36 scores were lower (minimum important difference at least 5 points) than previously described ARDS survivors in the domains of general health, mental health, vitality and social function.\n\n One patient had long-term disability as a result of ICU acquired weakness.\n\n Only 26% of survivors had returned to previous work levels at the time of follow-up.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis ARDS cohort had a high survival rate (86%) after use of ECMO support for reversible refractory hypoxemia.\n\n Long term survivors had similar physical health but decreased mental health, general health, vitality and social function compared to other ARDS survivors and an unexpectedly poor return to work.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3682304","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carol

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) could represent an important treatment option, if complications were reduced by new technical developments.\n\n\nMethods\nEfficiency, side effects and outcome of treatment with a new miniaturized device for veno-venous extracorporeal gas transfer were analysed in 60 consecutive patients with life-threatening respiratory failure.\n\n\nResults\nA rapid increase of partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) from 64 (48 to 86) mmHg to 120 (84 to 171) mmHg and a decrease of PaCO2 from 63 (50 to 80) mmHg to 33 (29 to 39) mmHg were observed after start of the extracorporeal support (P &lt; 0.001).\n\n Gas exchange capacity of the device averaged 155 (116 to 182) mL/min for oxygen and 210 (164 to 251) mL/min for carbon dioxide.\n\n Ventilatory parameters were reduced to a highly protective mode, allowing a fast reduction of tidal volume from 495 (401 to 570) mL to 336 (292 to 404) mL (P &lt; 0.001) and of peak inspiratory pressure from 36 (32 to 40) cmH2O to 31 (28 to 35) cmH2O (P &lt; 0.001).\n\n Transfusion requirements averaged 0.8 (0.4 to 1.8) units of red blood cells per day.\n\n Sixty-two percent

if unchecked this may result in inflammation and organ injury.\n Here, we review the pathophysiology of the inflammatory response to ECMO, highlighting the complex interactions between arms of the innate immune response, the endothelium and coagulation.\n An understanding of the processes involved may guide the design of therapies and strategies aimed at ameliorating inflammation during ECMO.\n Likewise, an appreciation of the potentially deleterious inflammatory effects of ECMO may assist those weighing the risks and benefits of therapy.\n","id":"PMC5125043","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jonathan E.","surname":"Millar","email":"j.millar@doctors.org.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jonathon P.","surname":"Fanning","email":"jonathon_fanning@me.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charles I.","surname":"McDonald","email":"Charles.McDonald@health.qld.gov.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel F.","surname":"McAuley","email":"d.f.mcauley@qub.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John F.","surname":"Fraser","email":"John.Fraser@health.qld.gov.au","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/0267659119830012","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effect of ex vivo extracorporeal membrane oxygenation flow dynamics on immune response","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMra1208623","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe sepsis and septic shock","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1473-3099(07)70265-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Host-pathogen interactions in sepsis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/s13054-014-0699-2","date":"2014-11-27","title":"The efficacy and safety of plasma exchange in patients with sepsis and septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Introduction\nSepsis and septic shock are leading causes of intensive care unit (ICU) mortality.\n\n They are characterized by excessive inflammation, upregulation of procoagulant proteins and depletion of natural anticoagulants.\n\n Plasma exchange has the potential to improve survival in sepsis by removing inflammatory cytokines and restoring deficient plasma proteins.\n\n The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plasma exchange in patients with sepsis.\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, reference lists of relevant articles, and grey literature for relevant citations.\n\n We included randomized controlled trials comparing plasma exchange or plasma filtration with usual care in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock.\n\n Two reviewers independently identified trials, extracted trial-level data and performed risk of bias assessments using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.\n\n The primary outcome was all-cause mortality reported at longest follow-up.\n\n Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1,957 records identified, we included four unique trials enrolling a total of 194 patients (one enrolling adults only, two enrolling children only, one enrolling adults and children).\n\n The mean age of adult patients ranged from 38 to 53 years (n?=?128) and the mean age of children ranged from 0.9 to 18 years (n?=?66).\n\n All trials were at unclear to high risk of bias.\n\n The use of plasma exchange was not associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.52, I2 60%).\n\n In adults, plasma exchange was associated with reduced mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96;

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","abstract":"WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown.\n Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO.\n The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally.\n Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges.\n Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan.\n ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre.\n Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access.\n ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.\n","id":"PMC7102637","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kollengode","surname":"Ramanathan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Antognini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alain","surname":"Combes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Paden","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bishoy","surname":"Zakhary","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Ogino","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Graeme","surname":"MacLaren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Brodie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kiran","surname":"Shekar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

validated.\n\n\nMethods\nCoagulation results, medications, and outcomes of consecutive patients being classified as having severe COVID?19 in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed.\n\n The 28?day mortality between heparin users and nonusers were compared, as was a different risk of coagulopathy, which was stratified by the sepsis?induced coagulopathy (SIC) score or D?dimer result.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 449 patients with severe COVID?19 enrolled into the study, 99 of them received heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin) for 7 days or longer.\n\n D?dimer, prothrombin time, and age were positively, and platelet count was negatively, correlated with 28?day mortality in multivariate analysis.\n\n No difference in 28?day mortality was found between heparin users and nonusers (30.3% vs 29.7%, P = .\n\n910).\n\n But the 28?day mortality of heparin users was lower than nonusers in patients with SIC score ?4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P = .\n\n029), or

disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) diagnostic criteria using antithrombin activity","abstract":"Background\nWith advances in the treatment of sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) has been losing its prognostic power.\n\n Since the SIRS category is no longer used for the diagnosis of sepsis, the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) diagnostic criteria released by Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) should be modified.\n\n Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the appropriateness of replacing the SIRS score with antithrombin activity in JAAM-DIC diagnostic criteria.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analyzed data from 819 septic patients who had received recombinant thrombomodulin.\n\n The relationships between the 28-day mortality rate and baseline laboratory and clinical parameters were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses, and the impact of replacing the SIRS criteria with antithrombin activity was evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nThe SIRS score, prothrombin time ratio, and antithrombin activity were associated with the 28-day mortality rate (P values?=?0.013, 0.018, and 0.003, respectively, by multivariate analysis).\n\n A modified version of the JAAM-DIC diagnostic criteria using an antithrombin activity &lt;70 % was capable of diagnosing the identical number (n?=?706) and a similar severity of patients (mortality, 34.6 % versus 34.8 %).\n\n\nConclusion\nSince anticoagulant therapy is expected to be more effective in patients with more severe coagulation disorders, the modified version of the JAAM-DIC diagnostic criteria might be useful for discriminating patients with sepsis who are good candidates for anticoagulant therapy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5024432","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Toshiaki","surname":"Iba","email":"toshiiba@cf6.so-net.ne.jp","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marcello","surname":"Di

pathway enrichment among key highly connected network genes.\n This unbiased approach produced a high-priority list of 4 genes in one pathway out of over 3,500 genes that were differentially expressed

We validated the importance of the urokinase pathway for SARS-CoV disease severity using genetically defined knockout mice, proteomic correlates of pathway activation, and pathological disease severity.\n The results of these studies demonstrate that a fine balance exists between host coagulation and fibrinolysin pathways regulating pathological disease outcomes, including diffuse alveolar
