Surgeon characteristics were recorded.\n\n The impact of COVID-19 on economic well-being, work, and mental health were also determined.\n\n All variables were compared and analyzed.\n\n\nResults:\nTwo hundred four surgeons answered the complete survey; most of them were male (96.6%), the average age was 47.7 years; 58.8% (n = 120) were orthopedic surgeons and 41.2% (n = 84) were neurosurgeons.\n\n The majority of the respondents were from Argentina (59.8%, n = 122), followed by Brazil (17.2%, n = 35), Chile (6.4%, n = 13), and Mexico (5.9%, n = 12).\n\n Most of the surgeons reported performing emergency procedures only during the pandemic (76.5%, n = 156).\n\n Half used telemedicine or online consultation modalities (54.4%, n = 111).\n\n The average concern about the financial situation due to the pandemic was 7.53 in a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the worst scenario).\n\n Twenty-two percent (n = 45) of the surgeons had a score over 10 in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; scores higher than 10 needs referral to confirm depression diagnosis).\n\n Young age and neurosurgery as a specialty were associated with higher PHQ-9 scores.\n\n\nConclusions:\nCOVID-19 has an impact in the daily working practice and financial situation of spine surgeons in Latin America.\n\n The long-term psychological impact should be taken into consideration to avoid a heavier burden for health care providers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8258821","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alfredo","surname":"Guiroy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martín","surname":"Gagliardi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Martín","surname":"Gagliardi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Coombes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Federico","surname":"Landriel","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Federico","surname":"Landriel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carlos","surname":"Zanardi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gastón Camino","surname":"Willhuber","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juan Pablo","surname":"Guyot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                            Marcelo","surname":"Valacco","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The psychological impact of the SARS epidemic on hospital employees in China: exposure, risk perception, and altruistic acceptance of risk","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychological impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome on health workers in a tertiary hospital","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The psychological impact of SARS: a matter of heart and mind","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prevalence of psychiatric disorders among Toronto hospital workers one to two years after the SARS outbreak","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Impact on health care workers employed in high-risk areas during the Toronto SARS outbreak","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Long-term psychological and occupational effects of providing hospital healthcare during SARS outbreak","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The experience of the 2003 SARS outbreak as a traumatic stress among frontline healthcare workers in Toronto: lessons learned","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Immediate and sustained psychological impact of an emerging infectious disease outbreak on health care workers","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Stress and psychological distress among SARS survivors 1 year after the outbreak","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The psychological effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome on emergency department staff","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coping responses of emergency physicians and nurses to the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The psychology of ongoing threat: relative risk appraisal, September 11, 2001, attacks and terrorism-related fears","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Perception of risk","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychological reactions to terrorist attacks.

service where physicians communicate with patients remotely using telecommunication technologies.\n\n Telemedicine is being used to provide pre-/postoperative surgical consultation and monitoring as well as surgical education.\n\n\nAim:\nOur purpose was to investigate the broad range of telemedicine technologies used in surgical care.\n\n\nMaterial and methods:\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Science Direct were searched for available literature from inception to March 30, 2018 with no language restrictions.\n\n The search terms included: cell phones, telemedicine, telecommunications, video, online, videoconferencing, remote consultation, surgery, preoperative, perioperative, postoperative, and surgical procedures.\n\n Studies were included if they used telemedicine in surgery for pre-, peri-, or post-surgery periods, and if they compared traditional surgical care with surgical telemedicine.\n\n We excluded case series, case reports, and conference abstracts from our review.\n\n\nResults:\nA total of 24 studies were included in our review.\n\n The study found that the use of telemedicine in preoperative assessment and diagnosis, evaluation after surgery and follow-up visits to be beneficial.\n\n Patients reported benefits to using telemedicine such as avoiding unnecessary trips to hospitals, saving time and reducing the number of working days

surgery.\n\n The purpose of this study was to evaluate telemedicine for the initial evaluation of patients in the clinic and hospital settings.\n\n\nMethods\nSynchronous telemedicine consults were conducted by a single surgeon to a rural hospital and clinic.\n\n Reasons for consult, adequacy of consult, days saved by telemedicine consult compared to standard practice, correlation of telemedicine and in-person physical exam, and number of patients who required procedures were evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nOn average, patients were evaluated 7.4?days more rapidly than if the consult had been done by our standard practice.\n\n Telemedicine was adequate for all patients in this study.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis is the first study using telemedicine for the initial consult of general surgery patients in the hospitalized and clinic setting in North America.\n\n The physical exam remains an important component of the general surgery evaluation, and special attention must be considered when structuring the telemedicine program.\n\n Telemedicine is an effective and expedient way to provide consultation for general surgery patients.\n\n Further study is needed to determine which general surgery issues are not amendable to telemedicine consultation, and to determine other surgical specialties that could utilize telemedicine in their practice.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7391901","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Caleb","surname":"Schroeder","email":"Caleb.schroeder@marylanning.org","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"FAQs

for Ebola Virus Disease in Rural Sierra Leone, and Some Implications for Containment","abstract":"The current outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in Upper West Africa is the largest ever recorded.\n Molecular evidence suggests spread has been almost exclusively through human-to-human contact.\n Social factors are thus clearly important to understand the epidemic and ways in which it might be stopped, but these factors have so far been little analyzed.\n The present paper focuses on Sierra Leone, and provides cross sectional data on the least understood part of the epidemicthe largely undocumented spread of Ebola in rural areas.\n Various forms of social networking in rural communities and their relevance for understanding pathways of transmission are described.\n Particular attention is paid to the relationship between marriage, funerals and land tenure.\n Funerals are known to be a high-risk factor for infection.\n It is suggested that more than a shift in awareness of risks will be needed to change local patterns of behavior, especially in regard to funerals, since these are central to the consolidation of community ties.\n A concluding discussion relates the information presented to plans for halting the disease.\n Local consultation and access are seen as major challenges to be addressed.\n","id":"PMC4401769","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Richards","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Amara","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mariane

systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Objective\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has placed health care workers under psychological stress.\n\n Previous reviews show a high prevalence of mental disorders among health care workers, but these need updating and inclusion of studies written in Chinese.\n\n The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide updated prevalence estimates for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, benefitting from the inclusion of studies published in Chinese.\n\n\nMethods\nSystematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar and the Chinese databases SinoMed, WanfangMed, CNKI and CQVIP, for studies conducted between December 2019 and August 2020 on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Studies published in both English and Chinese were included.\n\n\nResults\nData on the prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD was pooled across 65 studies involving 97,333 health care workers across 21 countries.\n\n The pooled prevalence of depression was 21.7% (95% CI, 18.3%-25.2%), of anxiety 22.1% (95% CI, 18.2%-26.3%), and of PTSD 21.5% (95% CI, 10.5%-34.9%).\n\n Prevalence estimates are also provided for a mild classification of each disorder.\n\n Pooled prevalence estimates of depression and anxiety were highest in studies conducted in the Middle-East (34.6%; 28.9%).\n\n Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted across covariates, including sampling method and outcome measure.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis has identified a high prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Appropriate support is urgently needed.\n\n The response would benefit from additional research on which interventions are effective at mitigating these risks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7946321","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yufei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"10"},{"firstname":"Nathaniel","surname":"Scherer","email":"NULL","contributions":"10"},{"firstname":"Lambert","surname":"Felix","email":"NULL","contributions":"20"},{"firstname":"Lambert","surname":"Felix","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hannah","surname":"Kuper","email":"NULL","contributions":"20"},{"firstname":"Hannah","surname":"Kuper","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jakob","surname":"Pietschnig","email":"NULL","contributions":"20"},{"firstname":"

shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese

for the surgical management of gynecological cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic - FRANCOGYN group for the CNGOF<","abstract":"Introduction\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, specific recommendations are required for the management of patients with gynecologic cancer.\n\n\nMaterials and method\nThe FRANCOGYN group of the National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF) convened to develop recommendations based on the consensus conference model.\n\n\nResults\nIf a patient with a gynecologic cancer presents with COVID-19, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days.\n\n For cervical cancer, radiotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy could replace surgery as first-line treatment and the value of lymph node staging should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n For advanced ovarian cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be preferred over primary cytoreduction surgery.\n\n It is legitimate not to perform hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n For patients who are scheduled to undergo interval surgery, chemotherapy can be continued and surgery performed after 6 cycles.\n\n For patients with early stage endometrial cancer of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy combined with a sentinel lymph node procedure is recommended.\n\n Surgery can be postponed for 12 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 12 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy).\n\n For patients of high ESMO risk, the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) should be applied to avoid pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomy.\n\n\nConclusion\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, management of a patient with cancer should be adapted to limit the risks associated with the virus without incurring loss of chance.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7118621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cherif","surname":"Akladios","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Henri","surname":"Azais","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marcos","surname":"Ballester","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sofiane","surname":"Bendifallah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre-Adrien","surname":"Bolze","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Bourdel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandre","surname":"Bricou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Geoffroy","surname":"Canlorbe","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"Carcopino","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pauline","surname":"Chauvet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Collinet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charles","surname":"Coutant","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yohann","surname":"Dabi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ludivine","surname":"Dion","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tristan","surname":"Gauthier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olivier","surname":"Graesslin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cyrille","surname":"Huchon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martin","surname":"Koskas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frederic","surname":"Kridelka","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincent","surname":"Lavoue","email":"Vincent.lavoue@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lise","surname":"Lecointre","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthieu","surname":"Mezzadri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Camille","surname":"Mimoun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lobna","surname":"Ouldamer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emilie","surname":"Raimond","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cyril","surname":"Touboul","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1097/TP.0000000000003258","date":"2020-03-31","title":"Global

general community: a prospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nData for front-line health-care workers and risk of COVID-19 are limited.\n\n We sought to assess risk of COVID-19 among front-line health-care workers compared with the general community and the effect of personal protective equipment (PPE) on risk.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a prospective, observational cohort study in the UK and the USA of the general community, including front-line health-care workers, using self-reported data from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application (app) from March 24 (UK) and March 29 (USA) to April 23, 2020. Participants were voluntary users of the app and at first use provided information on demographic factors (including age, sex, race or ethnic background, height and weight, and occupation) and medical history, and subsequently reported any COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n We used Cox proportional hazards modelling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of our primary outcome, which was a positive COVID-19 test.\n\n The COVID Symptom Study app is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04331509.\n\n\nFindings\nAmong 2?035?395 community individuals and 99?795 front-line health-care workers, we recorded 5545 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 34?435?272 person-days.\n\n Compared with the general community, front-line health-care workers were at increased risk for reporting a positive COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 11·61, 95% CI 10·9312·33).\n\n To account for differences in testing frequency between front-line health-care workers and the general community and possible selection bias, an inverse probability-weighted model was used to adjust for the likelihood of receiving a COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 3·40, 95% CI 3·373·43).\n\n Secondary and post-hoc analyses suggested adequacy of PPE, clinical setting, and ethnic background were also important factors.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn the UK and the USA, risk of reporting a positive test for COVID-19 was increased among front-line health-care workers.\n\n Health-care systems should ensure adequate availability of PPE and develop additional strategies to protect health-care workers from COVID-19, particularly those from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic backgrounds.\n\n Additional follow-up of these observational findings is needed.\n\n\nFunding\nZoe Global, Wellcome Trust, Engineering and

Mediator between Work-Related Stressors and Health Outcomes","abstract":"It is currently unknown if unfavorable working conditions, reflected by the demandcontrolsupport model and the effortreward imbalance model, directly influence health or if the effects may be mediated by work-related attitudes and behaviors such as workaholism.\n In the present study, 988 employees (55.6% males, mean age 36.09, SD = 9.23) from a large consultant firm participated in a cross-sectional survey assessing work variables such as job demands, job control, social support, effort, reward, and overcommitment.\n Workaholism was also assessed together with eight different health-related outcomes.\n Although direct effects of the work stressors on health were found on most health outcomes, the work-related stressors were overall strongly related to workaholism (R2 = 0.522), which, in turn, was positively related to four (anxiety/insomnia, somatic symptoms, emotional exhaustion, and social dysfunction) of the eight outcome variables.\n Of a total of 40 relationships between work-related stressors and health outcomes, workaholism fully mediated three of these, and partly mediated 12. Overall, the study suggests that the effects of work-related stressors on health in many cases may be mediated by workaholism.\n","id":"PMC5800172","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cecilie

rehabilitation program: differences in burnout profiles, depression, and recovery/resources-stress balance","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Burnout is generally perceived a unified disorder with homogeneous symptomatology across people (exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy).\n\n However, increasing evidence points to intra-individual patterns of burnout symptoms in non-clinical samples such as students, athletes, healthy, and burned-out employees.\n\n Different burnout subtypes might therefore exist.\n\n Yet, burnout subtypes based on burnout profiles have hardly been explored in clinical patients, and the samples investigated in previous studies were rather heterogeneous including patients with various physical, psychological, and social limitations, symptoms, and disabilities.\n\n Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore burnout subtypes based on burnout profiles in clinically diagnosed burnout patients enrolled in an employee rehabilitation program, and to investigate whether the subtypes differ in depression, recovery/resources-stress balance, and sociodemographic characteristics.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>One hundred three patients (66 women, 37 men) with a clinical burnout diagnosis, who were enrolled in a 5 week employee rehabilitation program in two specialized psychosomatic clinics in Austria, completed a series of questionnaires including the Maslach Burnout Inventory  General Survey (MBI-GS), the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Recovery-Stress-Questionnaire for Work.\n\n Cluster analyses with the three MBI-GS subscales as clustering variables were used to identify the burnout subtypes.\n\n Subsequent multivariate/univariate analysis of variance and Pearson chi-square tests were performed to investigate differences in depression, recovery/resources-stress balance, and sociodemographic characteristics.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Three different burnout subtypes were discovered: the exhausted subtype, the exhausted/cynical subtype, and the burned-out subtype.\n\n The burned-out subtype and the exhausted/cynical subtype showed both more severe depression symptoms and a worse recovery/resources-stress balance than the exhausted subtype.\n\n Furthermore, the burned-out subtype was more depressed than the exhausted/cynical subtype, but no difference was observed between these two subtypes with regard to perceived stress, recovery, and resources.\n\n Sociodemographic characteristics were not associated with the subtypes.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>The present study indicates that there are different subtypes in clinical burnout patients (exhausted, exhausted/cynical, and burned-out), which might represent patients at different developmental stages in the burnout cycle.\n\n Future studies need to replicate the current findings, investigate the stability of the symptom patterns, and examine the efficacy of rehabilitation interventions in different subtypes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5773035","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kathrin","surname":"Bauernhofer","email":"kathrin.bauernhofer@uni-graz.at","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniela","surname":"Bassa","email":"daniela.bassa@edu.uni-graz.at","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Daniela","surname":"Bassa","email":"daniela.bassa@edu.uni-graz.at","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Markus","surname":"Canazei","email":"markus.canazei@bartenbach.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paulino","surname":"Jiménez","email":"paul.jimenez@uni-graz.at","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Manuela","surname":"Paechter","email":"manuela.paechter@uni-graz.at","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ilona","surname":"Papousek","email":"ilona.papousek@uni-graz.at","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Fink","email":"andreas.fink@uni-graz.at","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elisabeth

Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure, depressive symptoms with the PHQ-9, and BP traits with the Borderline Personality Questionnaire.\n Burnout was found to be associated with BP traits, controlling for neuroticism and history of depressive disorders.\n In women, burnout was linked to both the affective insecurity and the impulsiveness component of BP.\n In men, only the link between burnout and affective insecurity reached statistical significance.\n Compared to participants with low BP scores, participants with high BP scores reported more burnout symptoms, depressive symptoms,

predicted a high prevalence of anxiety symptoms, which can affect their quality of life and the care that they provide.\n\n However, few studies have been conducted among community healthcare workers in China.\n\n We attempted to explore whether burnout mediates the association between occupational stress and anxiety symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was completed in Liaoning Province, China from November to December 2012. A total of 1,752 healthcare workers from 52 Community Health Centers participated in this study, and all participants were given self-administered questionnaires.\n\n These questionnaires addressed the following aspects: the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the Chinese version of the effort-reward imbalance scale and the Maslach Burnout InventoryGeneral Survey.\n\n Finally, the study included 1,243 effective respondents (effective response rate, 70.95%).\n\n Hierarchical linear regression analysis, performed with SPSS 17.0, was used to estimate the effect of burnout.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of anxiety symptoms among the community healthcare workers was 38.0%.\n\n After adjusting for demographic characteristics, the effortreward ratio and overcommitment positively predicted anxiety symptoms.\n\n Meanwhile, the effortreward ratio and overcommitment were positively related to the emotional exhaustion and cynicism subscales of burnout.\n\n In addition, the emotional exhaustion and cynicism subscales were positively related to anxiety symptoms.\n\n Thus, there is a link between burnout, occupational stress and anxiety symptoms.\n\n\nConclusions\nBurnout mediates the effect of occupational stress on anxiety symptoms.\n\n To effectively reduce the impact of occupational stress on anxiety symptoms, burnout management should be considered.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4161428","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yanwei","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Qu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Soraya","surname":"Seedat","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Soraya","surname":"Seedat","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jad.2018.02.090","date":"1970-01-01","title":"12-month

depression, anxiety, and substance abuse) and feelings of burnout among medical professionals all over the world and this has been shown to be associated with lapses in patient care.\n\n Data from India in this regard are limited.\n\n\nAims:\nTo assess the various psychological problems (depression, perceived stress, and burnout) among medical professionals working in a government-funded tertiary care institute of India.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nAn online e-mail survey was carried out among resident doctors and faculty members (a total of 1721 doctors).\n\n A total of 445 doctors (response rate-27.69%) responded to the survey.\n\n The survey included Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale, and Maslach Burnout Inventory.\n\n\nResults:\nOf the eligible 1607 participants, 445 responders, 376 (77.75%) were resident doctors and 69 (15.5%) were faculty.\n\n As per the PHQ-9, 30.1% of participants were found to have depression and 16.7% of participants reported suicidal ideations.\n\n About two-thirds of the sample experienced moderate level of stress (67.2%) and another 13% of participants reported high level of stress.\n\n More than 90% of the participants reported some level of burnout.\n\n Compared to faculty, higher proportion of the residents reported stress, depression, and burnout.\n\n Presence of depression, stress, or burnout was associated with lower indulgence in recreational activities, experiencing verbal or physical abuse in the hand of patients/caregivers, feelings that seniors do not show empathy toward patients, and seniors do not show empathy toward them.\n\n\nConclusions:\nThe present study suggests that a significantly higher proportion of doctors in Indian setting experience stress, depression, and burnout.\n\n The presence of stress, depression, and burnout is associated with long working hours and negative patient-related outcomes, adverse doctorpatient interactions, and interpersonal interactions among the colleagues.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6102958","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sandeep","surname":"Grover","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Swapnajeet","surname":"Sahoo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ashish","surname":"Bhalla","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ajit","surname":"Avasthi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jad.2012.02.043","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Do

Which criteria are relevant? How valid and reliable are the used tools?\nMethods \nBased on a systematic literature research in 36 databases, studies in English or German language, published since 2004, concerning medical and differential diagnoses, economic impact and ethical aspects of burnout, are included and evaluated.\n\n\nResults \n852 studies are identified.\n\n After considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria and after reviewing the full texts, 25 medical and one ethical study are included.\n\n No economic study met the criteria.\n\n\nDiscussion \nThe evidence of the majority of the studies is predominantly low.\n\n Most of the studies are descriptive and explorative.\n\n Self-assessment tools are mainly used, overall the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI).\n\n Objective data like medical parameters, health status, sick notes or judgements by third persons are extremely seldomly included in the studies.\n\n The sample construction is coincidental in the majority of cases, response rates are often low.\n\n Almost no longitudinal studies are available.\n\n There are insufficient results on the stability and the duration of related symptoms.\n\n The ambiguity of the burnout diagnosis is regularly neglected in the studies.\n\n\nConclusions \nThe authors conclude, that (1) further research, particularly high-quality studies are needed, to broaden the understanding of the burnout syndrome.\n\n Equally (2) a definition of the burnout syndrome has to be found which goes beyond the published understanding of burnout and is based on common scientific consent.\n\n Furthermore, there is a need (3) for finding a standardized, international accepted and valid procedure for the differentiated diagnostics of burnout and for (4) developing a third party assessment tool for the diagnosis of burnout.\n\n Finally, (5) the economic effects and implication of burnout diagnostics on the economy, the health insurances and the patients have to be analysed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3010892","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dieter","surname":"Korczak","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Beate","surname":"Huber","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Kister","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016009606.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The

been discussed as a major factor explaining and predicting disorders like depression or burnout.\n An unsolved question is whether there are specific personality factors allowing differentiation of burnout from depression.\n The present study tested the relation between one of the most prominent, biological personality theories, Cloningers Temperament and Character Inventory, and common measures of burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory General) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory 2) in a sample of German employees (N?=?944) and a sample of inpatients (N?=?425).\n Although the same personality traits (harm avoidance and self-directedness) were predominantly associated with burnout and depression, there was a much stronger association to depression than to burnout in both samples.\n Besides, we observed specific associations between personality traits and subcomponents of burnout.\n Our results underline differences in the association of burnout vs.\n depression to personality, which may mirror differences in scope.\n While symptoms of depression affect all aspects of life, burnout is supposed to be specifically related to the workplace and its requirements.\n The much stronger association of personality to depression can be important to select appropriate therapy methods and to develop a more specified treatment for burnout in comparison to depression.\n","id":"PMC4534781","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Martin

inflammatory and immune correlates.\n We investigated the interest of exploring biological parameters and sleep disturbances in relation to burnout symptoms among white-collar workers.\n Fifty-four participants with burnout were compared to 86 healthy control participants in terms of professional rank level, sleep, job strain (Karasek questionnaire), social support, anxiety and depression (HAD scale).\n Fasting concentrations of glycaemia, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), total-cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), and white blood cell (WBC) counts were assessed.\n Analysis of variance and a forward Stepwise Multiple Logistic Regression were made to identify predictive factors of burnout.\n Besides reporting more job strain (in particular job control p = 0.02), higher levels of anxiety (p&lt;0.001), and sleep disorders related to insomnia (OR = 21.5, 95%CI = 8.852.3), participants with burnout presented higher levels of HbA1C, glycaemia, CRP, lower levels of 25(OH)D, higher number of leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes (P&lt;0.001 for all) and higher total-cholesterol (P = 0.01).\n In particular, when HbA1c is &gt; 3.5%, the prevalence of burnout increases from 16.6% to 60.0% (OR = 4.3, 95%CI = 2.86.9).\n Strong significant positive correlation existed between HbA1C and the two dimensions (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization (r = 0.79 and r = 0.71, p&lt;0.01)) of burnout.\n Models including job strain, job satisfaction, anxiety and insomnia did not predict burnout (p = 0.30 and p = 0.50).\n However, when HbA1C levels is included, the prediction of burnout became significant (P = 0.03).\n Our findings demonstrated the interest of sleep and biological parameters, in

LILACS and Web of Science databases were searched without language or date restrictions.\n The Transparent Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed.\n Prospective studies that analyzed burnout as the exposure condition were included.\n Among the 993 articles initially identified, 61 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and 36 were analyzed because they met three criteria that must be followed in prospective studies.\n Burnout was a significant predictor of the following physical consequences: hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hospitalization due to cardiovascular disorder, musculoskeletal pain, changes in pain experiences, prolonged fatigue, headaches, gastrointestinal issues, respiratory problems, severe injuries and mortality below the age of 45 years.\n The psychological effects were insomnia, depressive symptoms, use of psychotropic and antidepressant medications, hospitalization for mental disorders and psychological ill-health symptoms.\n Job dissatisfaction, absenteeism, new disability pension, job demands, job resources and presenteeism were identified as professional outcomes.\n Conflicting findings were observed.\n In conclusion, several prospective and high-quality studies showed physical, psychological and occupational consequences of job burnout.\n The individual and social impacts

burnout scores at baseline.\n\n\nMethods\nThis is a randomized controlled intervention with a waiting list control group.\n\n Participants were employees working at least 75% of full time, reporting self-perceived regular sleep problems.\n\n Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention and at a 3-month follow-up through diaries, wrist-actigraphy and questionnaires including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the ShiromMelamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ).\n\n Fifty-one participants (63% women) completed data collections.\n\n\nResults\nA multilevel mixed model showed no significant differences between groups for sleep over time, while there was a significant effect on insomnia symptoms when excluding participants working shifts (N?=?11) from the analysis (p?=?0.044).\n\n Moreover, a moderating effect of baseline-levels of burnout scores was observed on insomnia symptoms (p?=?0.009).\n\n A post-hoc analysis showed that individuals in the intervention group with low burnout scores at baseline (SMBQ?&lt;?3.75) displayed significantly reduced ISI scores at follow-up, compared to individuals with high burnout scores at baseline (p?=?0.005).\n\n\nConclusions\nGroup CBT for insomnia given at the workplace did not reduce sleep problems looking at the group as a whole, while it was indicated that the intervention reduced insomnia in employees with regular daytime work.\n\n The results also suggest that workplace-based group CBT may improve sleep in employees with primary insomnia if not concomitant with high burnout scores.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00420-018-1291-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

burn-out of new nursing staff, (2) to verify the partial mediating role of anxiety in the relationship between workplace incivility and job burn-out, (3) to examine the resilience moderating the relations between workplace incivility and job burn-out.\n\n\nDesign\nA cross-sectional online survey was conducted in May 2016 in China.\n\n\nSetting\nThe survey was conducted in 54 cities across 29 provinces of China.\n\n\nParticipants\nA total of 903 participants were invited.\n\n Ultimately, 696 new nurses (&lt;3?service years) completed valid questionnaires.\n\n The effective response rate was 77.1%.\n\n Entry criteria: voluntary participation, having less than three service years and being a registered nurse.\n\n Exclusion criteria: being an irregular nurse, having more than three service years and refusing to participate in this work.\n\n\nOutcome measures\nAn anonymous questionnaire was distributed among new nurses.\n\n The relationships and mechanism among the variables were explored using descriptive statistical analysis, Pearsons correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression analysis.\n\n\nResults\nThe findings showed that workplace incivility was positively correlated with anxiety (r=0.371, p&lt;0.01) and job burn-out (r=0.238, p&lt;0.01) of new nurses.\n\n The positive relation between anxiety (?=0.364, p&lt;0.01) and job burn-out (?=0.240, p&lt;0.01) was also significant.\n\n Moreover, anxiety partially mediated (z=7.807, p&lt;0.01) and resilience moderated (?=?0.564, p&lt;0.01) the association between workplace incivility and job burn-out.\n\n\nConclusion\nExperience of workplace incivility by new nurses would likely generate anxiety in the victims.\n\n Further, the increased anxiety state could elevate their level of job burn-out.\n\n New nurses with high levels of resilience could buffer the negative influence of workplace incivility by using a positive coping style.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5892738","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shue","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fengzhe","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jinghui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhinan","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xinpeng","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lihua","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1590/s1413-24782018230048","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Burnout

Physicians","abstract":"Background\nWhether burnout is a distinct phenomenon rather than a type of depression and whether it is a syndrome, limited to three core components (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and low personal accomplishment) are subjects of current debate.\n\n We investigated the depression-burnout overlap, and the pertinence of these three components in a large, representative sample of physicians.\n\n\nMethods\nIn a cross-sectional study, all Austrian physicians were invited to answer a questionnaire that included the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), the Hamburg Burnout Inventory (HBI), as well as demographic and job-related parameters.\n\n Of the 40093 physicians who received an invitation, a total of 6351 (15.8%) participated.\n\n The data of 5897 participants were suitable for analysis.\n\n\nResults\nOf the participants, 10.3% were affected by major depression.\n\n Our study results suggest that potentially 50.7% of the participants were affected by symptoms of burnout.\n\n Compared to physicians unaffected by burnout, the odds ratio of suffering from major depression was 2.99 (95% CI 2.214.06) for physicians with mild, 10.14 (95% CI 7.5813.59) for physicians with moderate, 46.84 (95% CI 35.2562.24) for physicians with severe burnout and 92.78 (95% CI 62.96136.74) for the 3% of participants with the highest HBI_sum (sum score of all ten HBI components).\n\n The HBI components Emotional Exhaustion, Personal Accomplishment and Detachment (representing depersonalization) tend to correlate more highly with the main symptoms of major depression (sadness, lack of interest and lack of energy) than with each other.\n\n A combination of the HBI components Emotional Exhaustion, Helplessness, Inner Void and Tedium (adj.\n\nR2 = 0.92) explained more HBI_sum variance than the three core components (adj.\n\nR2 = 0.85) of burnout combined.\n\n Cronbachs alpha for Emotional Exhaustion, Helplessness, Inner Void and Tedium combined was 0.90 compared to ? = 0.54 for the combination of the three core components.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates the overlap of burnout and major depression in terms of symptoms and the deficiency of the three-dimensional concept of burnout.\n\n In our opinion, it might be preferable to use multidimensional burnout inventories in combination with valid depression scales than to rely exclusively on MBI when clinically assessing burnout.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4773131","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Walter","surname":"Wurm","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katrin","surname":"Vogel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Holl","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christoph","surname":"Ebner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dietmar","surname":"Bayer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sabrina","surname":"Mörkl","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Istvan-Szilard","surname":"Szilagyi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erich","surname":"Hotter","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hans-Peter","surname":"Kapfhammer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Hofmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jacobus","surname":"van

disorders: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Objective\nThe objective was to conduct an update of a previously published review and meta-analysis on the association between work-related psychosocial risk factors and stress-related mental disorders (SRD).\n\n\nDesign\nSystematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n\nData sources\nMedline, Embase and PsycINFO were searched for articles published between 2008 and 12 August 2019 and references of a systematic review performed for the period before 2008 were included.\n\n Primary prospective studies were included when outcome data were described in terms of SRD assessment or a dichotomous outcome, based on a validated questionnaire, and at least two levels of work-related exposure were reported (exposed vs less or non-exposed).\n\n We used GRADE to assess the evidence for the associations between risk factors and the onset of SRD.\n\n\nResults\nSeventeen studies met the inclusion criteria.\n\n In total, a population of 73 874 workers from Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands and Sweden were included in the meta-analysis of 14 prospective cohort studies.\n\n This meta-analysis revealed moderate evidence for associations between SRD and effort reward imbalance (OR=1.9, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.15), high job demands (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.72), organisational justice (ORs=1.6 to 1.7, CIs 1.44 to 1.86), social support (ORs=1.3 to 1.4, CIs 1.16 to 1.69), high emotional demands (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.84) and decision authority (OR=1.3, CI 1.20 to 1.49).\n\n No significant or inconsistent associations were found for job insecurity, decision latitude, skill discretion and bullying.\n\n\nConclusion\nModerate evidence was found that work-related psychosocial risk factors are associated with a higher risk of SRD.\n\n Effort-reward imbalance, low organisational justice and high job demands exhibited the largest increased risk of SRD, varying from 60% to 90%.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7337889","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Henk F","surname":"van der

overall quality of research evidence in systematic reviews about prognosis due to the nature of the primary studies.\n\n Standards aimed at improving the quality of primary studies on the prognosis of health conditions have been created, but these standards are often not adequately followed causing confusion about how to judge the evidence.\n\n\nMethods\nThis article presents a proposed adaptation of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), which was developed to rate the quality of evidence in intervention research, to judge the quality of prognostic

that can increase it (moderate or large effect size, exposure-response gradient).\n\n\nConclusions\nWe describe criteria for evaluating the potential impact of each of these factors on the quality of

followed-up over one year within the framework of the Somstress study.\n\n Based on two consecutive measurements, an index of cumulative job stress was constructed and its associations with five indicators of mental health were studied, excluding caseness at entry (for depression, anxiety, somatisation, chronic fatigue and psychotropic drug consumption respectively).\n\n Taking into account the longitudinal design, four categories of job stress are defined: 1) employees free from stress at both measures, 2) job stress present at first measure but not at the second one, 3) recent onset of job stress as evidenced by second measure 4) workers exposed to stress at both measures.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression with appropriate adjustments was applied.\n\n\nResults\nIn bivariate

ability, even leading to early retirement.\n\n Several studies report associations between psychosocial working conditions and CMD.\n\n However, there is a lack of longitudinal research within a broad framework of psychosocial working conditions and improvement in CMD.\n\n The aim of this study was to examine the associations between several psychosocial working conditions and deteriorating and improving CMD among ageing employees over a five-to-six-year follow-up period.\n\n\nMethods\nThe study is based on the Helsinki Health Study baseline survey in 20012002 and a follow-up in 2007 (N?=?4340, response rate 83%) conducted among 40-60-year-old female and male employees.\n\n The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to measure common mental disorders.\n\n Psychosocial working conditions were measured in terms of job strain, organisational justice, work-family interface, social support and workplace bullying.\n\n The covariates included sociodemographic and health

systematic review to identify, assess and summarize research on the mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic on HCWs (healthcare workers).\n We utilized the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's Live map of covid-19 evidence on 11 May and included 59 studies.\n Six reported on implementing interventions, but none reported on effects of the interventions.\n HCWs reported low interest in professional help, and greater reliance on social support and contact.\n Exposure to covid-19 was the most commonly reported correlate of mental health problems, followed by female gender, and worry about infection or about infecting others.\n Social support correlated with less mental health problems.\n HCWs reported anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and distress during the covid-19 pandemic.\n We assessed the certainty of the estimates of prevalence of these symptoms as very low using GRADE.\n Most studies did not report comparative data on mental health symptoms before the pandemic or in the general population.\n There seems to be a mismatch between risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes among HCWs in the current pandemic, their needs and preferences, and the

crisis in China: a qualitative study","abstract":"Background\nIn the early stages of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei, China, the local health-care system was overwhelmed.\n\n Physicians and nurses who had no infectious disease expertise were recruited to provide care to patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge, no studies on their experiences of combating COVID-19 have been published.\n\n We aimed to describe the experiences of these health-care providers in the early stages of the outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a qualitative study using an empirical phenomenological approach.\n\n Nurses and physicians were recruited from five COVID-19-designated hospitals in Hubei province using purposive and snowball sampling.\n\n They participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews by telephone from Feb 10 to Feb 15, 2020. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Haase's adaptation of Colaizzi's phenomenological method.\n\n\nFindings\nWe recruited nine nurses and four physicians.\n\n Three theme categories emerged from data analysis.\n\n The first was being fully responsible for patients' wellbeingthis is my duty.\n\n Health-care providers volunteered and tried their best to provide care for patients.\n\n Nurses had a crucial role in providing intensive care and assisting with activities of daily living.\n\n The second category was challenges of working on COVID-19 wards.\n\n Health-care providers were challenged by working in a totally new context, exhaustion due to heavy workloads and protective gear, the fear of becoming infected and infecting others, feeling powerless to handle patients' conditions, and managing relationships in this stressful situation.\n\n The third category was resilience amid challenges.\n\n Health-care providers identified many sources of social support and used self-management strategies to cope with the situation.\n\n They also achieved transcendence from this unique experience.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe intensive work drained health-care providers physically and emotionally.\n\n Health-care providers showed their resilience and the spirit of professional dedication to overcome difficulties.\n\n Comprehensive support should be provided to safeguard the wellbeing of health-care providers.\n\n Regular and intensive training for all health-care providers is necessary to promote preparedness and efficacy in crisis management.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China, Project of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education in

The well-constructed questionnaire was designed and registered at online website (Kwiksurveys) and validated.\n A total of 669 participants from 30 different countries across the world responded.\n After scrutiny, completed questionnaires (n = 650) were included in the study.\n Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. Chi-Square and Spearman correlation tests were applied to control confounders and assess the relation of dentists response with respect to gender and educational level.\n More than two-thirds of the general dental practitioners (78%) from 30 countries questioned were anxious and scared by the devastating effects of COVID-19. A large number of dentists (90%) were aware of recent changes in the treatment protocols.\n However, execution of amended treatment protocol was recorded as 61%.\n The majority of the dentists (76%) were working in the hospital setting out of which 74% were from private, and 20% were from government setups.\n Individually we received a large number of responses from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, but collectively more than 50% of the responses were from other parts of the world.\n Despite having a high standard of knowledge and practice, dental practitioners around the globe are in a state of anxiety and fear while working in their respective fields due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on humanity.\n A number of dental practices have either modified their services according to the recommended guidelines to emergency treatment only or closed down practices for an uncertain period.\n","id":"PMC7216192","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Muhammad Adeel","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rizwan","surname":"Jouhar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rizwan","surname":"Jouhar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Naseer","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Naseer","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samira","surname":"Adnan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samira","surname":"Adnan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marziya","surname":"Aftab","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Muhammad Sohail","surname":"Zafar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zohaib","surname":"Khurshid","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zohaib","surname":"Khurshid","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102157","date":"2020-04-30","title":"Working in the emergency and inpatient COVID-19 special wards: A different experience for Iranian psychiatric trainees amid the outbreak","abstract":"","id":"PMC7198408","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Behnam","surname":"Shariati","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mehrdad","surname":"Eftekhar Ardebili","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohammadreza","surname":"Shalbafan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1055/a-1159-5575","date":"1970-01-01","title":"[Experience of practice-based psychiatrists and neurologists during the COVID-19 pandemic]","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.12659/MSM.924171","date":"2020-03-13","title":"Psychological Impact and Coping Strategies of Frontline Medical Staff in Hunan Between January and March 2020 During the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei, China","abstract":"Background\nThroughout China, during the recent epidemic in Hubei province, frontline medical staff have been responsible for tracing contacts of patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact and coping strategies of frontline medical staff in Hunan province, adjacent to Hubei province, during the COVID-19 outbreak between January and March 2020.\nMaterial/Methods\nA cross-sectional observational study included doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff throughout Hunan province between January and March 2020. The study questionnaire included five sections and 67 questions (scores, 03).\n\n The chi-squared ?2 test was used to compare the responses between professional groups, age-groups, and gender.\n\n\nResults\nStudy questionnaires were completed by 534 frontline medical staff.\n\n The responses showed that they believed they had a social and professional obligation to continue working long hours.\n\n Medical staff were anxious regarding their safety and the safety of their families and reported psychological effects from reports of mortality from COVID-19 infection.\n\n The availability of strict infection control guidelines, specialized equipment, recognition of their efforts by hospital management and the government, and reduction in reported cases of COVID-19 provided psychological benefit.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei resulted in increased stress for medical staff in adjacent Hunan province.\n\n Continued acknowledgment of the medical staff by hospital management and the government, provision of infection control guidelines, specialized equipment and facilities for the management of COVID-19 infection should be recognized as factors that

contact paediatric physicians to undertake an online Likert scale survey between 17 and 24 March.\n\n Respondents' specialty, experience and work setting were recorded.\n\n Ordinal logistic regression was used to determine respondent factors.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 542 respondents from across Australia and New Zealand: an estimated 11% of the paediatric physician workforce.\n\n A minority (36.6%) agreed that their national response had been well coordinated; the majority (92.7%) agreed that senior?level hospital administrators were taking the situation seriously.\n\n Most reported a good

and Cordon Sanitaire Among the Community and Health Professionals in Wuhan, China: Cross-Sectional Survey","abstract":"Background\nThe mental health consequences of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, community-wide interventions, and social media use during a pandemic are unclear.\n\n The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan.\n\n Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff ?3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff ?3), respectively.\n\n A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2).\n\n Similarly, of the 214 health professionals, about one-fifth of surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (n=47, 22.0%, 95% CI 16.6-28.1) or probable depression (n=41, 19.2%, 95% CI 14.1-25.1).\n\n Around one-third of community-based adults and health professionals spent ?2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media.\n\n Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending ?2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults.\n\n Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks.\n\n Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental health.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7219721","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edson","surname":"Da

challenges to nursing staff.\n\n\nObjective\nTo explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from January 20, to February 10, 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method.\n\n\nResults\nThe psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into 4 themes.\n\n First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members.\n\n Second, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition.\n\n Third, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection.\n\n Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted.\n\n In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually.\n\n Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7141468","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Niuniu","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luoqun","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Suling","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Jiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Runluo","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongwei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhaoguo","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yanli","surname":"You","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuhua","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongyun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.7326/m20-1083","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychological

on clinicians of working to manage novel viral outbreaks, and successful measures to manage stress and psychological distress.\n\n\nDesign\nRapid review and meta-analysis.\n\n\nData sources\nCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar, searched up to late March 2020.\nEligibility criteria for study selection\nAny study that described the psychological reactions of healthcare staff working with patients in an outbreak of any emerging virus in any clinical setting, irrespective of any comparison with other clinicians or the general population.\n\n\nResults\n59 papers met the inclusion criteria: 37 were of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), eight of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), seven of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), three each of Ebola virus disease and influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and one of influenza A virus subtype H7N9. Of the 38 studies that compared psychological outcomes of healthcare workers in direct contact with affected patients, 25 contained data that could be combined in a pairwise meta-analysis comparing healthcare workers at high and low risk of exposure.\n\n Compared with lower risk controls, staff in contact with affected patients had greater levels of both acute or post-traumatic stress (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.29) and psychological distress (1.74, 1.50 to 2.03), with similar results for continuous outcomes.\n\n These findings were the same as in the other studies not included in the meta-analysis.\n\n Risk factors for psychological distress included being younger, being more junior, being the parents of dependent children, or having an infected family member.\n\n Longer quarantine, lack of practical support, and stigma also contributed.\n\n Clear communication, access to adequate personal protection, adequate rest, and both practical and psychological support were associated with reduced morbidity.\n\n\nConclusions\nEffective interventions are available to help mitigate the psychological distress experienced by staff caring for patients in an emerging disease outbreak.\n\n These interventions were similar despite the wide range of settings and types of outbreaks covered in this review, and thus could be applicable to the current covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7199468","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Steve","surname":"Kisely","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Warren","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"McMahon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Dalais","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Irene","surname":"Henry","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Siskind","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.31234/osf.io/w9uxs","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Factors

SARS?CoV?2","abstract":"Background\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2) virus and resulting COVID?19 pandemic present important diagnostic challenges.\n\n Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify current infection, rule out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response.\n\n Serology tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS?CoV?2 aim to identify previous SARS?CoV?2 infection, and may help to confirm the presence of current infection.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has SARS?CoV?2 infection, or has previously had SARS?CoV?2 infection, and the accuracy of antibody tests for use in seroprevalence surveys.\n\n\nSearch methods\nWe undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID?19 Study Register and the COVID?19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv.\n\n In addition, we checked repositories of COVID?19 publications.\n\n We did not apply any language restrictions.\n\n We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 27 April 2020.\nSelection criteria\nWe included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antibody tests (including enzyme?linked immunosorbent assays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, and lateral flow assays) in people suspected of current or previous SARS?CoV?2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection.\n\n We also included studies of people either known to have, or not to have SARS?CoV?2 infection.\n\n We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS?CoV?2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests (RT?PCR) and clinical diagnostic criteria).\n\n\nData collection and analysis\nWe assessed possible bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS?2 tool.\n\n We extracted 2x2 contingency table data and present sensitivity and specificity for each antibody (or combination of antibodies) using paired forest plots.\n\n We pooled data using random?effects logistic regression where appropriate, stratifying by time since post?symptom onset.\n\n We tabulated available data by test manufacturer.\n\n We have presented uncertainty in estimates of sensitivity and specificity using 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\n\n\nMain results\nWe included 57 publications reporting on a total of 54 study cohorts with 15,976 samples, of which 8526 were from cases of SARS?CoV?2 infection.\n\n Studies were conducted in Asia (n = 38), Europe (n = 15), and the USA and China (n = 1).\n\n We identified data from 25 commercial tests and numerous in?house assays, a small fraction of the 279 antibody assays listed by the Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics.\n\n More than half (n = 28) of the studies included were only available as preprints.\n\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nThe sensitivity of antibody tests is too low in the first week since symptom onset to have a primary role for the diagnosis of COVID?19, but they may still have a role complementing other testing in individuals presenting later, when RT?PCR tests are negative, or are not done.\n\n Antibody tests are likely to have a useful role for detecting previous SARS?CoV?2 infection if used 15 or more days after the onset of symptoms.\n\n However, the duration of antibody rises is currently unknown, and we found very little data beyond 35 days post?symptom onset.\n\n We are therefore uncertain about the utility of these tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management purposes.\n\n Concerns about high risk of bias and applicability make it likely that the accuracy of tests when used in clinical care will be lower than reported in the included studies.\n\n Sensitivity has mainly been evaluated in hospitalised patients, so it is unclear whether the tests are able to detect lower antibody levels likely seen with milder and asymptomatic COVID?19 disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7387103","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan

its context is a paramount example for such claims.\n\n In this article, we describe why expressing the certainty in evidence to support a decision is critical and why the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach matters now, perhaps more than ever and no matter what the specific topic is in relation to COVID-19. We finally also offer suggestions for how it can be used appropriately to support decision-making at global, national, and local level when emergency, urgent or rapid responses are needed.\n\n\nStudy Design and Setting\nThis is an invited commentary to address the objectives above building on examples from the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n This includes an iterative discussion of examples and development of guidance.\n\n\nResults\nThe GRADE approach is a transparent and structured method for assessing the certainty of evidence and when developing recommendations that requires little additional time.\n\n We describe why emergency, urgent, or rapid responses do not justify omitting this critical assessment of the evidence.\n\n In situations of emergencies and urgencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, GRADE can similarly be used to express and convey certainty in intervention effects, test accuracy, risk and prognostic factors, consequences of public health measures, and qualitative bodies of evidence.\n\n\nConclusions\nAssessing and communicating the certainty of evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic is critical.\n\n Those offering evidence synthesis or making recommendations should use transparent ratings of the body of evidence supporting a claim regardless of time that is available or needed to provide this response.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7274969","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Holger J.","surname":"Schünemann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Santesso","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gunn E.","surname":"Vist","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carlos","surname":"Cuello","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tamara","surname":"Lotfi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Signe","surname":"Flottorp","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marina","surname":"Davoli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Reem","surname":"Mustafa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joerg J.","surname":"Meerpohl","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pablo","surname":"Alonso-Coello","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elie A.","surname":"Akl","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s12245-020-00299-5","date":"2020-07-06","title":"Physical and mental health impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare workers: a scoping review","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread to 198 countries, with approximately 2.4 million confirmed cases and 150,000 deaths globally as of April 18.

of healthcare professionals: a rapid review","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Epidemics or pandemics, such as the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, pose unique challenges to healthcare professionals (HCPs).\n\n Caring for patients during an epidemic/pandemic may impact negatively on the mental health of HCPs.\n\n There is a lack of evidence-based advice on what would be effective in mitigating this impact.\n\n Objectives: This rapid review synthesizes the evidence on the psychological impact of pandemics/epidemics on the mental health of HCPs, what factors predict this impact, and the evidence of prevention/intervention strategies to reduce this impact.\n\n\nMethod\nid='Par2'>According to rapid review guidelines, systematic searches were carried out in Embase.\n\ncom, PubMed, APA PsycINFO-Ovid SP, and Web of Science (core collection).\n\n Searches were restricted to the years 2003 or later to ensure inclusion of the most recent epidemic/pandemics, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n\n Papers written in French or English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and of quantitative design using validated measures of mental health outcomes were included.\n\n Of 1308 papers found, 50 were included.\n\n The full protocol for this rapid review was registered with Prospero (reg.\n\nno.\n\n CRD42020175985).\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Results show that exposed HCPs working with patients during an epidemic/pandemic are at heightened risk of mental health problems in the short and longer term, particularly: psychological distress, insomnia, alcohol/drug misuse, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, burnout, anger, and higher perceived stress.\n\n These mental health problems are predicted by organizational, social, personal, and psychological factors and may interfere with the quality of patient care.\n\n Few evidence-based early interventions exist so far.\n\n\nDiscussion\nid='Par4'>HCPs need to be provided with psychosocial support to protect their mental wellbeing if they are to continue to provide high quality patient care.\n\n Several recommendations relevant during and after an epidemic/pandemic, such as COVID-19, and in preparation for a future outbreak, are proposed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7422454","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Suzannah","surname":"Stuijfzand","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Camille","surname":"Deforges","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vania","surname":"Sandoz","email":"vania.sandoz@bluewin.ch","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Consuela-Thais","surname":"Sajin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cecile","surname":"Jaques","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jolanda","surname":"Elmers","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antje","surname":"Horsch","email":"Antje.Horsch@chuv.ch","contributions":"2"}],"References

There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required.\n Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience.\n New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure.\n This Position Paper provides a strategy that may be both adapted for, and integrated with, research efforts in other countries.\n","id":"PMC7159850","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emily A","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rory C","surname":"O'Connor","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"V Hugh","surname":"Perry","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Irene","surname":"Tracey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Wessely","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Louise","surname":"Arseneault","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Clive","surname":"Ballard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Helen","surname":"Christensen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roxane","surname":"Cohen Silver","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ian","surname":"Everall","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tamsin","surname":"Ford","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ann","surname":"John","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Kabir","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kate","surname":"King","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ira","surname":"Madan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Michie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrew K","surname":"Przybylski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roz","surname":"Shafran","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Angela","surname":"Sweeney","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carol M","surname":"Worthman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lucy","surname":"Yardley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katherine","surname":"Cowan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claire","surname":"Cope","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Hotopf","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ed","surname":"Bullmore","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102052","date":"2020-03-26","title":"Chinese mental health burden during the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic significantly affects mental health of Chinese people.\n","id":"PMC7195325","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yeen","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Zhao","email":"743159984@qq.com","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112954","date":"2020-03-26","title":"Generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and sleep quality during COVID-19 outbreak in China: a web-based cross-sectional survey","abstract":"\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak significantly affects the mental health of Chinese public","id":"PMC7152913","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yeen","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Zhao","email":"zhaoning2018@email.szu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.031","date":"2020-04-12","title":"The differential psychological distress of populations affected by the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"","id":"PMC7156946","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huipeng","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haiping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shining","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qifeng","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tingyun","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Baoguo","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/ijerph17072381","date":"2020-03-28","title":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Quality of Life among Local Residents in Liaoning Province, China: A Cross-Sectional Study","abstract":"Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and quality of life among local Chinese residents aged ?18 years in Liaoning Province, mainland China.\n An online survey was distributed through a social media platform between January and February 2020.

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·031·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·6112·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater

questionnaire packet which consisted of the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ).\n\n A total of 79 doctors and 86 nurses participated in the survey.\n\n Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between SAS, SDS, and SCSQ score.\n\n A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively.\n\n History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression.\n\n The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively.\n\n History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses.\n\n The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender

Wuhan.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional, anonymized, self-reported questionnaire survey was conducted at the Childrens Healthcare Centre of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.\n\n The questionnaire consisted of three parts, including socio-demographic characteristics and COVID-19 epidemic-related factors, the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and Zungs self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS).\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 47 out of 123 (38%) participants with PSQI scores &gt; 7 were identified as having sleep disturbance.\n\n A logistic

measures, to the extent that the Italian government has imposed a quarantine on the entire country.\n Quarantine has a huge impact and can cause considerable psychological strain.\n The present study aims to establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress in the general population.\n An online survey was administered from 1822 March 2020 to 2766 participants.\n Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to examine the associations between sociodemographic variables; personality traits; depression, anxiety, and stress.\n Female gender, negative affect, and detachment were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress.\n Having an acquaintance infected was associated with increased levels of both depression and stress, whereas a history of stressful situations and medical problems was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety.\n Finally, those with a family member infected and young person who had to work outside their domicile presented higher levels of anxiety and stress, respectively.\n This epidemiological picture is an important benchmark for identifying persons at greater risk of suffering from psychological distress and the results are useful for tailoring psychological interventions targeting the post-traumatic nature of the distress.\n","id":"PMC7246819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cristina","surname":"Mazza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eleonora","surname":"Ricci","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Eleonora","surname":"Ricci","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Silvia","surname":"Biondi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marco","surname":"Colasanti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefano","surname":"Ferracuti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Napoli","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Napoli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Roma","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Roma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.009","date":"2020-05-08","title":"Prevalence

emerged in China in late 2019, most citizens were home-quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n This study explored the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in a sample of home-quarantined college students to identify the psychological distress risk factors.\n\n\nMethod\nThe PTSD and depressive symptoms in the 2485 participants from 6 universities were investigated using online survey versions of the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version and the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9), and data on sleep durations, exposure, home-quarantine time and socio-demographic variables were also collected.\n\n\nResults\nThe PTSD and depression prevalence were found to be 2.7% and 9.0%.\n\n Subjectively, feeling extreme fear was the most significant risk factor for psychological distress, followed by short sleep durations, being in their graduating year (4th year) and living in severely afflicted areas.\n\n Sleep durations was a mediator between exposures and mental health problems.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results suggested that the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 could be serious.\n\n Psychological interventions that reduce fear and improve sleep durations need to be made available to the home-quarantined university students, and graduating students and those in the worst-hit areas should be given priority

challenges to nursing staff.\n\n\nObjective\nTo explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from January 20, to February 10, 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method.\n\n\nResults\nThe psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into 4 themes.\n\n First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members.\n\n Second, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition.\n\n Third, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection.\n\n Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted.\n\n In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually.\n\n Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7141468","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Niuniu","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luoqun","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suling","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Jiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Runluo","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongwei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoguo","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanli","surname":"You","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuhua","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongyun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1080/14767058.2020.1763949","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychological

weeks later, and to investigate factors of mental health among youth groups.\n A cross-sectional study was conducted two weeks after the occurrence of COVID-19 in China.\n A total of 584 youth enrolled in this study and completed the question about cognitive status of COVID-19, the General Health Questionnaire(GHQ-12), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Negative coping

nearly 40.4% the sampled youth were found to be prone to psychological problems and 14.4% the sampled youth with Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.\n Univariate logistic regression revealed that youth mental health was significantly related to being less educated (OR?=?8.71, 95%CI:1.9738.43), being the enterprise employee (OR?=?2.36, 95%CI:1.095.09), suffering from the PTSD

pandemic, community-wide interventions, and social media use during a pandemic are unclear.\n\n The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan.\n\n Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff ?3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff ?3), respectively.\n\n A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2).\n\n Similarly, of the 214 health professionals, about one-fifth of surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (n=47, 22.0%, 95% CI 16.6-28.1) or probable depression (n=41, 19.2%, 95% CI 14.1-25.1).\n\n Around one-third of community-based adults and health professionals spent ?2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media.\n\n Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending ?2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults.\n\n Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks.\n\n Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental

Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point.\n\n The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms.\n\n Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups.\n\n\nResults\nPregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.\n\n02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration.\n\n These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.\n\n005).\n\n The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.\n\n003), suspected infections (P=.\n\n004), and deaths per day (P=.\n\n001).\n\n Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak.\n\n\nConclusion\nMajor life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm.\n\n Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7211756","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yanting","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Han","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chenchi","surname":"Duan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cheng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianxia","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hualin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiangjuan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yeping","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiufeng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yiping","surname":"You","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongmei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuangqi","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoling","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yajuan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haihong","surname":"Lao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Wen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junying","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuhua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Diyun","surname":"Meng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jingli","surname":"Zhai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Youchun","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qinwen","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiuping","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xifeng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cindy-Lee","surname":"Dennis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"He-feng","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/da.22077","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk

families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9%, 22.4%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7%, 11.9%).\n\n Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS.\n\n People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than in the unaffected group during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb.\n\n 2020. The government should focus more on providing economic and medical support to improve the general populations mental state.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7199435","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoming","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuai","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinrong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/jnnp-2020-323134","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychological

among health professional students during the COVID-19 outbreak","abstract":"Background\nDue to the drastic surge of COVID-19 patients, many countries are considering or already graduating health professional students early to aid professional resources.\n\n We aimed to assess outbreak-related psychological distress and symptoms of acute stress reaction (ASR) in health professional students and to characterize individuals with potential need for interventions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a prospective cohort study of 1442 health professional students at Sichuan University, China.\n\n At baseline (October 2019), participants were assessed for childhood adversity, stressful life events, internet addiction, and family functioning.\n\n Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined associations of the above exposures with subsequent psychological distress and ASR in response to the outbreak.\n\n\nResults\nThree hundred and eighty-four (26.63%) participants demonstrated clinically significant psychological distress, while 160 (11.10%) met the criterion for a probable ASR.\n\n Individuals who scored high on both childhood adversity and stressful life event experiences during the past year were at increased risks of both distress (ORs 2.002.66) and probable ASR (ORs 2.233.10), respectively.\n\n Moreover, internet addiction was associated with elevated risks of distress (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.602.64) and probable ASR (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.503.10).\n\n By contrast, good family functioning was associated with decreased risks of distress (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.330.55) and probable ASR (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.330.69).\n\n All associations were independent of baseline psychological distress.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that COVID-19 related psychological distress and high symptoms burden of ASR are common among health professional students.\n\n Extended family and professional support should be considered for vulnerable individuals during these unprecedented times.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7225209","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yuchen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yue","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jingwen","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Unnur

disease (AD), is one of the most burdensome medical conditions.\n\n Usually, the reviews that aim at calculating the prevalence of dementia include estimates from studies without assessing their methodological quality.\n\n Alzheimers Disease International (ADI) proposed a score to assess the methodological quality of population-based studies aimed at estimating the prevalence of dementia.\n\n During the last three years, the European Commission has funded three projects (Eurodem, EuroCoDe, and ALCOVE) in order to estimate the prevalence of dementia in Europe.\n\n\nObjective:\nThe aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of data on the prevalence of dementia in Europe derived from studies that included only subjects with a diagnosis of dementia according to the DSM IV criteria, and that had a high quality score according to ADI criteria.\n\n\nMethods:\nWe considered the studies selected by the two projects EuroCoDe (19932007) and Alcove (20082011), and we performed a new bibliographic search.\n\n For the systematic review, we only selected the subset of articles that included subjects with a diagnosis of dementia according to the DSM IV criteria.\n\n The studies were qualitatively assessed using the ADI tool.\n\n\nResults:\nThe meta-analysis considered 9 studies that were carried out in Europe

problems, but also caused great psychological distress, especially for medical staff.\n\n We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n\nMethod\nMedical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers.\n\n The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms.\n\n We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms.\n\n\nResult\nThere were a total of 1,563 participants in our study.\n\n Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score ? 8).\n\n A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.07.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.20.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.02.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = 1.63.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.33.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.38.5).\n\n\nConclusion\nOur study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor.\n\n Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various

Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (Sars-CoV-2) and COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) have caused an emergency status in the health system, including in the dentistry environment.\n Italy registered the third highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world and the second highest in Europe.\n An anonymous online survey composed of 40 questions has been sent to dentists practicing in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia, one of the areas in Italy most affected by COVID-19. The survey was aimed at highlighting the practical and emotional consequences of COVID-19 emergence on daily clinical practice.\n Specifically, it assessed dentists behavioral responses, emotions and concerns following the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic restrictive measures introduced by the Italian national administrative order of 10 March 2020 (DM-10M20), as well as the dentists perception of infection likelihood for themselves and patients.\n Furthermore, the psychological impact of COVID-19 was assessed by means of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 test (GAD-7), that measures the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms.\n Using local dental associations (ANDI-Associazione Nazionale Dentisti Italiani, CAO-Commissione Albo Odontoiatri) lists, the survey was sent by email to all dentists in the district of Modena and Reggio Emilia (874 practitioners) and was completed by 356 of them (40%).\n All dental practitioners closed or reduced their activity to urgent procedures, 38.2% prior to and 61.8% after the DM-10M20. All reported a routinely use of the most common protective personal equipment (PPE), but also admitted that the use of PPE had to be modified during COVID-19 pandemic.\n A high percentage of patients canceled their previous appointments after the DM-10M20. Almost 85% of the dentists reported being worried of contracting the infection during clinical activity.\n The results of the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) evaluation showed that 9% of respondents reported a severe anxiety.\n To conclude, the COVID-19 emergency is having a highly negative impact on the activity of dentists practicing in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia.\n All respondents reported practice closure or strong activity reduction.\n The perception of this negative impact was accompanied by feelings of concern (70.2%), anxiety (46.4%) and fear (42.4%).\n The majority of them (89.6%) reported concerns about their professional future and the hope for economic measures to help dental practitioners.\n","id":"PMC7277877","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ugo","surname":"Consolo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierantonio","surname":"Bellini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierantonio","surname":"Bellini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Davide","surname":"Bencivenni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Davide","surname":"Bencivenni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cristina","surname":"Iani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vittorio","surname":"Checchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmj.327.7414.557","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Measuring

set standards in the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\n\n Our aim was to evaluate the impact of PRISMA endorsement on the quality of reporting and methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published in journals in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology (GH).\n\n\nMethods\nQuality of reporting and methodological quality were evaluated by assessing the adherence of papers to PRISMA checklist and AMSTAR quality scale.\n\n After identifying the GH journals which endorsed PRISMA in instructions for authors (IA), we appraised: 15 papers published in 2012 explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group A); 15 papers from the same journals published in 2012 not explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group B); 30 papers published the year preceding PRISMA endorsement from the same journals as above (Group C); 30 papers published in 2012 on the 10 highest impact factor journals in GH which not endorsed PRISMA (Group D).\n\n\nResults\nPRISMA statement was referred in the IA in 9 out of 70 GH journals (12.9%).\n\n We found significant increase in overall adherence to PRISMA checklist (Group A, 90.1%; Group C, 83.1%; p?=?0.003) and compliance to AMSTAR scale (Group A, 85.0%; Group C, 74.6%; p?=?0.002), following the PRISMA endorsement from the nine GH journals.\n\n Explicit referencing of PRISMA in

compliance with AMSTAR were significantly higher in journals endorsing PRISMA compared to those not (Groups A+B vs.\n\n D; p?=?0.003 and p?=?0.016, respectively).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe endorsement of PRISMA resulted in increase of both quality of reporting and methodological quality.\n\n It is advised that an increasing number of medical journals include PRISMA in the instructions for

and meta-analyses published in nursing journals: a cross-sectional study","abstract":"Objective\nSystematic reviews (SRs) often poorly report key information, thereby diminishing their usefulness.\n\n Previous studies evaluated published SRs and determined that they failed to meet explicit criteria or characteristics.\n\n The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was recommended as a reporting guideline for SR and meta-analysis (MA), but previous studies showed that adherence to the statement was not high for SRs published in different medical fields.\n\n Thus, the aims of this study are twofold: (1) to investigate the number of nursing journals that have required or recommended the use of the PRISMA statement for reporting SR, and (2) to examine the adherence of SRs and/or meta-analyses to the PRISMA statement published in nursing journals.\n\n\nDesign\nA cross-sectional study.\n\n\nMethods\nNursing journals listed in the ISI journal citation report were divided into 2 groups based on the recommendation of PRISMA statement in their Instruction for Authors.\n\n SRs and meta-analyses published in 2014 were searched in 3 databases.\n\n 37 SRs and meta-analyses were randomly selected in each group.\n\n The adherence of each item to the PRISMA was examined and summarised using descriptive statistics.\n\n The quality of the SRs was assessed by Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews.\n\n The differences between the 2 groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.\n\n\nResults\nOut of 107 nursing journals, 30 (28.0%) recommended or required authors to follow the PRISMA statement when they submit SRs or meta-analyses.\n\n The median rates of adherence to the PRISMA statement for reviews published in journals with and without PRISMA endorsement were 64.9% (IQR: 17.692.3%) and 73.0% (IQR: 59.594.6%), respectively.\n\n No significant difference was observed in any of the items between the 2 groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe median adherence of SRs and meta-analyses in nursing journals to PRISMA is low at 64.9% and 73.0%, respectively.\n\n Nonetheless, the adherence level of nursing journals to the PRISMA statement does not significantly vary whether they endorse or recommend such a guideline.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5306529","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wilson W S","surname":"Tam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kenneth K

QUOROM to PRISMA: A Survey of High-Impact Medical Journals' Instructions to Authors and a Review of Systematic Reviews in Anesthesia Literature","abstract":"Background\nThe PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement was published to help authors improve how they report systematic reviews.\n\n It is unknown how many journals mention PRISMA in their instructions to authors, or whether stronger journal language regarding use of PRISMA improves author compliance.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nAn Internet-based investigation examined the extent to which 146 leading medical journals have incorporated the PRISMA Statement into their instructions to authors.\n\n Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n\n Also, systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals and the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses) Statement were used to explore the hypothesis that indicating compliance with the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript is associated with improved compliance with the reporting guideline.\n\n In a sample of 146 journals publishing systematic reviews, the PRISMA Statement was referred to in the instructions to authors for 27% (40/146) of journals; more often in general and internal medicine journals (7/14; 50%) than in specialty medicine journals (33/132; 25%).\n\n In the second part of the study, 13 systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals in 2008 were included for appraisal.\n\n Mention of the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript was associated with higher compliance with the QUOROM checklist (P?=?0.022).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nMost of the leading medical journals used ambiguous language regarding what was expected of authors.\n\n Further improvement on quality of reporting of systematic reviews may entail journals clearly informing authors of their requirements.\n\n Stronger directions, such as requiring an indication of adherence to a research quality of reporting statement in the manuscript, may improve reporting and utility of systematic reviews.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3217994","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kun-ming","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiao-qian","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing-hui","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Moher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-quan","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei-feng","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert

program implemented to perform meta-analyses of proportions in Stata.\n\n It builds further on the existing Stata procedure metan which is typically used to pool effects (risk ratios, odds ratios, differences of risks or means) but which is also used to pool proportions.\n\n Metaprop implements procedures which are specific to binomial data and allows computation of exact binomial and score test-based confidence intervals.\n\n It provides appropriate methods for dealing with proportions close to or at the margins where the normal approximation procedures often break down, by use of the binomial distribution to model the within-study variability or by allowing Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation to stabilize the variances.\n\n Metaprop was applied on two published meta-analyses: 1) prevalence of HPV-infection in women with a Pap smear showing ASC-US; 2) cure rate after treatment for cervical precancer using cold coagulation.\n\n\nResults\nThe first meta-analysis showed a pooled HPV-prevalence of 43% (95% CI: 38%-48%).\n\n In the second meta-analysis, the pooled percentage of cured women was 94% (95% CI: 86%-97%).\n\n\nConclusion\nBy using

testing in the management of women with equivocal cervical cytological abnormalities, but not in case of low-grade lesions.\n We performed a meta-analysis including studies where the high-risk probe of the Hybrid Capture-II is used to triage these two cytological categories.\n The triage test-positivity rate reflects the colposcopy referral workload.\nData were pooled on the HPV test positivity rate in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS/ASC-US) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), derived from different cytological classification systems.\n The meta-analysis was restricted to studies, published between 1991 and 2007. A random-effect model was applied for meta-analytical pooling and the influence of covariates on the HPV positivity rate was analyzed by meta-regression.\n The variation by age was assessed within individual studies since age strata were not defined uniformly.\n On an average, 43% (95% CI: 4046%) of women with ASCUS/ASC-US were high-risk HPV positive (range 2374%).\n In women with LSIL, the pooled positivity rate was 76% (95% CI: 7181%; range 5589%).\n In spite of considerable inter-study heterogeneity, the difference in HPV positivity between the two triage groups was large and highly significant: 32% (95% CI: 2738%).\n HPV rates dropped tremendously as age and cutoffs of test positivity increased.\n Other factors (cytological classification system, country, continent, collection method and year of publication) had no statistically significant impact, except in LSIL triage where HPV positivity was significantly lower in European compared to American studies.\n Women with LSIL, especially younger women, have high HPV positivity rates suggesting limited utility of reflex HPV triaging these cases.\n Research is needed to identify more specific methods to triage women with low-grade squamous cervical lesions.\n","id":"PMC3822872","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Arbyn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Martin-Hirsch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frank","surname":"Buntinx","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Van

meta-regression of diagnostic test accuracy data  a tutorial","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Although statistical procedures for pooling of several epidemiological metrics are generally available in statistical packages, those for meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies including options for multivariate regression are lacking.\n\n Fitting regression models and the processing of the estimates often entails lengthy and tedious calculations.\n\n Therefore, packaging appropriate statistical procedures in a robust and user-friendly program is of great interest to the scientific community.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>metadta is a statistical program for pooling of diagnostic accuracy test data in Stata.\n\n It implements both the bivariate random-effects and the fixed-effects model, allows for meta-regression, and presents the results in tables, a forest plot and/or summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) plot.\n\n For a model without covariates, it quantifies the unexplained heterogeneity due to between-study variation using an I2 statistic that accounts for the mean-variance relationship and the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.\n\n To demonstrate metadta, we applied the program on two published meta-analyses on: 1) the sensitivity and specificity of cytology and other markers including telomerase for primary diagnosis of bladder cancer, and 2) the accuracy of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing on self-collected versus clinician-collected samples to detect cervical precancer.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Without requiring a continuity correction, the pooled sensitivity and specificity generated by metadta of telomerase for the diagnosis of primary bladder cancer was 0.77 [95% CI, 0.70, 0.82] and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.75, 0.97] respectively.\n\n Metadta also allowed to assess the relative accuracy of HPV testing on self- versus clinician-taken specimens using data from comparative studies conducted in different clinical settings.\n\n The analysis showed that HPV testing with target-amplification assays on self-samples was as sensitive as on clinician-samples in detecting cervical pre-cancer irrespective of the clinical setting.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>The metadta program implements state of art statistical procedures in an attempt to close the gap between methodological statisticians and systematic reviewers.\n\n We expect the program to popularize the use of appropriate statistical methods for diagnostic meta-analysis further.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8962039","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Victoria

pandemic impact on mental health: a web-based cross-sectional survey on a sample of Italian general practitioners","abstract":"Background:\nSince the World Health Organization declared the new 2019 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak first a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and then a pandemic, Italy held more than 195.350 cases and 26.380 deaths.\n\n Working in the frontline with suspected Covid-19 infection patients, general practitioners (GPs) are daily under both physical and psychological pressure.\n\n\nMethods:\nA web-based cross-sectional survey was carried out on italian GPs working in Genoa (Italy), to assess the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on mental health.\n\n The survey was anonymous and a free Google Forms® software was used.\n\n\nResults:\nOne hundred thirty-one GPs completed the survey.\n\n Compared to GPs with absent or mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 &lt; 10), GPs reporting moderate to severe depressive symptoms (N=30, 22.9%; PHQ-9 ? 10) reported more helplessness (96.7% vs.\n\n 79.2%, p=.\n\n025), spent more than three hours searching for COVID-19 information (43.3% vs.\n\n 19.8%, p=.\n\n024), perceived less adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (6.7% vs.\n\n 23.8%, p=.\n\n049) and visited more COVID-19 infected patients (16.63 ± 27.30 vs.\n\n 9.52 ± 11.75, p=.\n\n041).\n\n Moreover, PHQ-9 ? 10 GPs reported a significant higher severity for both anxiety and insomnia (13.43 ± 4.96 vs.\n\n 4.88 ± 3.53 and 11.60 ± 5.53 vs.\n\n 4.84 ± 3.81, respectively; p&lt;.\n\n001), and a worse quality of life in both

urgent need to provide continuity of care for patients at the community-level, adequate PPE to GPs and a clear guidance from public health institutions.\n\n A precarious healthcare system both at a

Buddies: Rapid Deployment of a Psychological Resilience Intervention for Health Care Workers During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","abstract":"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its rapid global spread have created unprecedented challenges to health care systems.\n Significant and sustained efforts have focused on mobilization of personal protective equipment, intensive care beds, and medical equipment, while substantially less attention has focused on preserving the psychological health of the medical workforce tasked with addressing the challenges of the pandemic.\n And yet, similar to battlefield conditions, health care workers are being confronted with ongoing uncertainty about resources, capacities, and risks; as well as exposure to suffering, death, and threats to their own safety.\n These conditions are engendering high levels of fear and anxiety in the shortterm, and place individuals at risk for persistent stressexposure syndromes, subclinical mental health symptoms, and professional burnout in the longterm.\n Given the potentially wide-ranging mental health impact of COVID-19, protecting health care workers from adverse psychological effects of the pandemic is critical.\n Therefore, we present an overview of the potential psychological stress responses to the COVID-19 crisis in medical providers and describe preemptive resilience-promoting strategies at the organizational and personal level.\n We then describe a rapidly deployable Psychological Resilience Intervention founded on a peersupport model (Battle Buddies) developed by the United States Army.\n This interventionthe product of a multidisciplinary collaboration between the Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral Sciences at the University of Minnesota Medical Centeralso incorporates evidence-informed stress inoculation methods developed for managing psychological stress exposure in providers deployed to disasters.\n Our multilevel, resource-efficient, and scalable approach places 2 key tools directly in the hands of providers: (1) apeersupport Battle Buddy; and (2) adesignated mental health consultant who can facilitate training in stress inoculation methods, provide additional support, or coordinate referral for external professional consultation.\n In parallel, we have instituted a voluntary research data-collection component that will enable us to evaluate the interventions effectiveness while also identifying the most salient resilience factors for future iterations.\n It is our hope that these elements will provide guidance to other organizations seeking to protect the well-being of their medical workforce during the pandemic.\n Given the remarkable adaptability of human beings, we believe that, by promoting resilience, our diverse health care workforce can emerge from this monumental challenge with new skills, closer relationships, and greater confidence in the power of community.\n","id":"PMC7199769","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cristina

more vulnerable to complications of infection because of age and comorbid conditions.\n\n\nDesign:\nCross-sectional survey linked to 3 active clinical trials and 1 cohort study.\n\n\nSetting:\n5 academic internal medicine practices and 2 federally qualified health centers.\n\n\nPatients:\n630 adults aged 23 to 88 years living with 1 or more chronic

coronavirus.\n\n Nearly a third could not correctly identify symptoms (28.3%) or ways to prevent infection (30.2%).\n\n One in 4 adults (24.6%) believed that they were not at all likely to get the

outbreak.\n\n In multivariable analyses, participants who were black, were living below the poverty level, and had low health literacy were more likely to be less worried about COVID-19, to not believe that they would become infected, and to feel less prepared for an outbreak.\n\n Those with low health literacy had greater confidence in the federal government

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

COVID-19 Response: Survey of Health Care and Other Workers","abstract":"Background\nThe response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created an unprecedented disruption in work conditions.\n\n This study describes the mental health and well-being of workers both with and without clinical exposure to patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and describe work-related and personal factors associated with their mental health and well-being.\n\n\nMethods\nAll faculty, staff, and postdoctoral fellows of a university, including its medical school, were invited in April 2020 to complete an online questionnaire measuring stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being.\n\n We examined associations between these outcomes and factors including work in high-risk clinical settings and family/home stressors.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%).\n\n Overall, 34% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 61% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home.\n\n Among all workers, anxiety (prevalence ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.73), depression (prevalence ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59), and high work exhaustion (prevalence ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.36) were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19. Poor family-supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes (prevalence ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.21-1.62; prevalence ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.48-1.92; and prevalence ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.44-1.64, respectively).\n\n Age &lt;40 years and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with these poorer outcomes.\n\n Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and working in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on the mental health and well-being of both clinical and nonclinical employees.\n\n Mitigating exposure to COVID-19 and increasing supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being for all workers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7470175","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anne","surname":"Moorhead","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Albert","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Albert","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bojana","surname":"Knezevic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bradley

and burnout","abstract":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put considerable physical and emotional strain on frontline healthcare workers.\n Among frontline healthcare workers, physician trainees represent a unique groupfunctioning simultaneously as both learners and caregivers and experiencing considerable challenges during the pandemic.\n However, we have a limited understanding regarding the emotional effects and vulnerability experienced by trainees during the pandemic.\n We investigated the effects of trainee exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 on their depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment.\n All physician trainees at an academic medical center (n = 1375) were invited to participate in an online survey.\n We compared the measures of depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment among trainees who were exposed to patients being tested for COVID-19 and those that were not, using univariable and multivariable models.\n We also evaluated perceived life stressors such as childcare, home schooling, personal finances and work-family balance among both groups.\n 393 trainees completed the survey (29% response rate).\n Compared to the non-exposed group, the exposed group had a higher prevalence of stress (29.4% vs.\n 18.9%), and burnout (46.3% vs.\n 33.7%).\n The exposed group also experienced moderate to extremely high perceived stress regarding childcare and had a lower work-family balance.\n Multivariable models indicated that trainees who were exposed to COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher stress (10.96 [95% CI, 9.65 to 12.46] vs 8.44 [95% CI, 7.3 to 9.76]; P = 0.043) and were more likely to be burned out (1.31 [95% CI, 1.21 to1.41] vs 1.07 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.19]; P = 0.002].\n We also found that female trainees were more likely to be stressed (P = 0.043); while unmarried trainees were more likely to be depressed (P = 0.009), and marginally more likely to have anxiety (P = 0.051).\n To address these challenges, wellness programs should focus on sustaining current programs, develop new and targeted mental health resources that are widely accessible and devise strategies for creating awareness regarding these resources.\n","id":"PMC7410237","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas

medical errors, and previously validated measures including the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), a one-item burnout measure, the World Health Organizations abbreviated quality of life assessment (WHOQOL-BREF), and PROMIS short-form depression, anxiety, and sleep-related impairment scales.\n\n Between 2 and 3 weeks later, 227 (91%) repeated the PFI and the sleep-related impairment scale.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Principal components analysis justified PFI subscales for professional fulfillment, work exhaustion, and interpersonal disengagement.\n\n Test-retest reliability

burnout measures correlated highly (r ? 0.50) with their closest related MBI equivalents.\n\n Cohens d effect size differences in self-reported medical errors for high versus low burnout classified

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":" Updates on the novel coronavirus outbreak up to March 2, 2020.

masks.\n HCWs whose family/peers greatly encouraged face mask use had lower prevalence of depression.\n Access to adequate supplies of personal protective equipment is essential for the psychological health of HCWs working in stressful environments, through potentially easing their perceptions of vulnerability to

a systematic review and meta-analysis compliant with PRISMA guidance.\n Databases and grey literature were searched to April 2013, and records were screened against protocol eligibility criteria.\n Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken using a piloted form.\n Random-effects meta-analyses estimated (i) pooled proportion of HCWs willing to work and (ii) pooled odds ratios of risk factors associated with willingness to work.\n Heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test.\n Data were synthesized narratively where meta-analyses were not possible.\n Forty-three studies met our inclusion criteria.\n Meta-analysis of the proportion of HCWs willing to work was abandoned due to excessive heterogeneity (I2 = 99·2%).\n Narrative synthesis showed study estimates ranged from 23·1% to 95·8% willingness to work, depending on context.\n Meta-analyses of specific factors showed that male HCWs, physicians and nurses, full-time employment, perceived personal safety, awareness of pandemic risk and clinical knowledge of influenza pandemics, role-specific knowledge, pandemic response training, and confidence in personal skills were statistically significantly associated with increased willingness.\n Childcare obligations were significantly associated with decreased willingness.\n HCWs' willingness to work during an influenza pandemic was moderately high, albeit highly variable.\n Numerous risk factors showed a statistically significant association with willingness to work

to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience, anticipation of the pandemic may have impact on behaviors related to influenza vaccination (IV) and relevant public health behaviors such as wearing a face mask when having influenza-like-illnesses (ILI), which would play an important role in the control of human avian influenza outbreaks.\n\n This paper investigated the prevalence and factors related to IV uptake and use of face mask in public venues when having ILI symptoms.\n\n\n\nMethods:\n\nAn anonymous cross-sectional population-based random telephone survey of 302 Hong Kong Chinese adults aged 1860, using a structured questionnaire, was conducted in November 2005.\n\nResults:\n\nIn the last 3 months, 17.9% of the respondents received IV; 36.6% of those presenting ILI symptoms often used face mask in public venues.\n\n Anticipation of a bird-to-human H5N1 outbreak, perceptions that such an outbreak would be worse than SARS, that IV was efficacious in preventing bird-to-human avian influenza transmission were associated with the studied IV behavior (OR=2.643.97, p &lt; 0.05).\n\n Exposure to live birds, perceived similar symptoms between influenza and bird-to-human H5N1 avian influenza, that bird-to-human avian influenza was more lethal than SARS were predictive use of face mask when having ILI symptoms (OR = 4.258.34, p &lt; 0.05).\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe prevalence of IV and use of face mask in the study population may be increasing, which may be related to concerns of avian influenza.\n\n Perceptions related to human avian influenza were associated with IV and mask use behaviors.\n\n This can potentially be turned into opportunities of promoting desirable public health behaviors.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7099207","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"J.

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 2024 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt;

China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19

rate and mortality has created an unprecedented state of emergency worldwide.\n\n This global situation may have a negative impact on the psychological well?being of individuals which in turn impacts individuals' performance.\n\n This study aims to explore the prevalence of depression and anxiety among the GP, HCPs, and USs during COVID?19 outbreak, and to identify key population(s) who might need psychological intervention.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross?sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22 and 28 March 2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during the COVID?19 outbreak.\n\n The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ?9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder?7 (GAD?7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants.\n\n Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 23.8% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\n Anxiety was most prevalent across university students 21.5%, followed by healthcare professionals 11.3%, and general population 8.8%.\n\n Females among healthcare professionals and university students, divorced healthcare professionals, pulmonologists, and university students with history of chronic disease were at higher risk of developing depression.\n\n Females, divorced participants among the general population, and university students with history of chronic disease and those with high income (?1,500 JD) were at higher risk of developing anxiety.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring outbreaks, individuals are put under extreme stressful condition resulting in higher risk of developing anxiety and depression particularly for students and healthcare professionals.\n\n Policymakers and mental healthcare providers are advised to provide further mental support to these vulnerable groups during this pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7361060","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Abdallah

The present study examined the association between subjective well-being (SWB) and psychopathology and investigated the etiology of this association in a large population-based cohort study of adolescent twins (n = 9,136) and their non-twin siblings (n = 1,474) aged 1220 years.\n Phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations between SWB and psychopathology were obtained from multivariate genetic modeling conditional on sex.\n An SWB factor score was used based on measures of subjective happiness, satisfaction with life, and quality of life.\n Psychopathology was obtained from all syndrome and broad-band scales of the Dutch version of the ASEBA Youth Self Report.\n Males reported significantly higher levels of SWB than females.\n Females reported significantly more internalizing problems while males report significantly higher levels of externalizing behavior.\n In both sexes, significant negative associations were found between SWB and psychopathology, with the strongest associations seen for SWB and the YSR syndrome scale anxious/depression behavior.\n The observed associations were primarily explained by genetic correlations while non-shared environmental influences were mainly domain specific.\n The genetic liability to lower levels of SWB are indicative of a genetic liability to higher levels of psychopathology, suggesting that it might be feasible to screen for emotional and behavioral problems before clear signs are present by screening on indices of subjective well-being.\n","id":"PMC3897864","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Meike","surname":"Bartels","email":"m.bartels@vu.nl","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John

may affect their academic performance.\n\n We aimed to characterize the university students attended by psychiatrists at the students mental health service (SAPPE) and to compare their academic performance with that of non-patient students.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING:\n Cross-sectional study based on review of medical files and survey of academic data at a Brazilian public university.\n\n \nMETHODS:\n Files of 1,237 students attended by psychiatrists at SAPPE from 2004 to 2011 were reviewed.\n\n Their academic performance coefficient (APC) and status as of July 2015 were compared to those of a control group of 2,579 non-patient students matched by gender, course and year of enrolment.\n\n \nRESULTS:\n 37% of the patients had had psychiatric treatment and 4.5% had made suicide attempts before being attended at SAPPE.\n\n Depression (39.1%) and anxiety disorders/phobias (33.2%) were the most frequent diagnoses.\n\n Severe mental disorders such as psychotic disorders (3.7%) and bipolar disorder (1.9%) were less frequent.\n\n Compared with non-patients, the mean APC among the undergraduate patients was slightly lower (0.63; standard deviation, SD: 0.26; versus 0.64; SD: 0.28; P = 0.025), but their course completion rates were higher and course abandonment rates were lower.\n\n Regarding postgraduate students, patients and non-patients had similar completion rates, but patients had greater incidence of discharge for poor performance and lower dropout rates.\n\n \nCONCLUSION:\n Despite the inclusion of socially vulnerable people with severe mental disorders, the group of patients had similar academic performance, and in some aspects better, than, that of non-patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9969722","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cláudia Ribeiro

Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

in cancer patients and in the general population","abstract":"Background\nThe Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9 is a widely used instrument to screen for depression in clinical research.\n\n The first aim of this study was to psychometrically test the PHQ-9 in a large sample of cancer patients.\n\n The second aim was to calculate unbiased estimates of the depression burden for several cancer groups taking into account age and gender distributions.\n\n\nMethods\nA sample of 2,059 cancer patients with varying diagnoses were examined in this study six months after discharge from a rehabilitation clinic.\n\n A representative sample of 2,693 people from the general population served as controls.\n\n Expected PHQ-9 mean scores of the general population sample, regressed on age and gender, were calculated to enable a fair comparison of different groups of cancer patients.\n\n\nResults\nWhile the reliability (Cronbachs alpha) for the PHQ-9 scale was good (alpha???0.84), the CFA fit indices of the one-dimensional solution were unsatisfactory in the patients sample.\n\n The factorial analysis confirmed two factors.\n\n PHQ-9 mean scores for 15 types of cancer are given, ranging from 4.0 (prostate) to 8.2 (thyroid gland).\n\n Differences between expected mean scores (derived from the general population) and raw mean scores of the cancer subsamples are reported that provide a better estimate of the depression burden.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results confirmed that the PHQ-9 performs well in testing depression in cancer patients.\n\n Regression coefficients can be used for performing unbiased comparisons among cancer groups, not only for this study.\n\n The burden of patients with testis cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma is underestimated when age and gender are not taken into account.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4736493","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Hinz","email":"Andreas.Hinz@medizin.uni-leipzig.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anja","surname":"Mehnert","email":"Anja.Mehnert@medizin.uni-leipzig.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rüya-Daniela","surname":"Kocalevent","email":"R.Kocalevent@uke.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elmar","surname":"Brähler","email":"Elmar.Braehler@medizin.uni-leipzig.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Forkmann","email":"tforkmann@ukaachen.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susanne","surname":"Singer","email":"singers@uni-mainz.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Schulte","email":"tschulte@badoexen.de","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.19.20025395","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Generalized

Citations, PsycINFO, and Web of Science (January 2000-February 2015).\n\n\nInclusion criteria\nEligible studies compared PHQ-9 scores with major depression diagnoses from validated diagnostic interviews.\n\n Primary study data and study level data extracted from primary reports were synthesized.\n\n For PHQ-9 cut-off scores 5-15, bivariate random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity, separately, among studies that used semistructured diagnostic interviews, which are designed for administration by clinicians; fully structured interviews, which are designed for lay administration; and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric (MINI) diagnostic interviews, a brief fully structured interview.\n\n Sensitivity and specificity were examined among participant subgroups and, separately, using meta-regression, considering all subgroup variables in a single model.\n\n\nResults\nData were obtained for 58 of 72 eligible studies (total n=17?357; major depression cases n=2312).\n\n Combined sensitivity and specificity was maximized at a cut-off score of 10 or above among studies using a semistructured interview (29 studies, 6725 participants; sensitivity 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.92; specificity 0.85, 0.82 to 0.88).\n\n Across cut-off scores 5-15, sensitivity with semistructured interviews was 5-22% higher than for fully structured interviews (MINI excluded; 14 studies, 7680 participants) and 2-15% higher than for the MINI (15 studies, 2952 participants).\n\n Specificity was similar across diagnostic interviews.\n\n The PHQ-9 seems to be similarly sensitive but may be less specific for younger patients than for older patients; a cut-off score of 10 or above can be used regardless of age.\n\n.\n\n\nConclusions\nPHQ-9 sensitivity compared with semistructured diagnostic interviews was greater than in previous conventional meta-analyses that combined reference standards.\n\n A

Due to male gender characteristics and existing public image, nursing is often not considered as a career choice by men.\n\n Whether nursing would benefit from increased number of men is a key question in the literature.\n\n The purpose of this integrative review of the literature was to identify factors influencing men to enter the nursing profession.\n\n In addition, it sought to understand the challenges they are confronted within this profession.\n\n\nEvidence Acquisition:\nA systematic search of the existing literature was performed using an Internet search with broad keywords to access related articles in both Persian and English databases.\n\n Finally, 34 studies (written between 2000 and early 2013) were selected and surveyed.\n\n\nResults:\nMost of the studies were conducted in developed counties.\n\n The review identified reasons why males choose nursing, and other challenges facing men entering and working in nursing.\n\n Themes that emerged from the literature include educational and societal barriers experienced by men in nursing, recruitment, career choice, and role strain.\n\n\nConclusions:\nRegarding mens influences on professional development, and also the importance of gender-based caring, policies for recruitment and retention of men in nursing must be followed hastily.\n\n However, there is a need for further research

China","abstract":"Background\nHealthcare workers fighting against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are under tremendous pressure, which puts them at an increased risk of developing psychological problems.\n\n\nAims\nThis study aimed to investigate the prevalence of psychological problems in different healthcare workers (ie, physicians, medical residents, nurses, technicians and public health professionals) during the COVID-19 pandemic in China and explore factors that are associated with the onset of psychological problems in this population during this public health crisis.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted in February 2020 among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Psychological problems were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire and Insomnia Severity Index.\n\n Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the factors that were associated with psychological problems.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia and the overall psychological problems in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China was 46.04%, 44.37%, 28.75% and 56.59%, respectively.\n\n The prevalence of the overall psychological problems in physicians, medical residents, nurses, technicians and public health professionals was 60.35%, 50.82%, 62.02%, 57.54% and 62.40%, respectively.\n\n Compared with healthcare workers who did not participate in front-line work, front-line healthcare workers had a higher risk of anxiety, insomnia and overall psychological problems.\n\n In addition, attention to negative or neutral information about the pandemic, receiving negative feedback from families and friends who joined front-line work, and unwillingness to join front-line work if given a free choice were three major factors for these psychological problems.\n\n\nConclusions\nPsychological problems are pervasive among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Receiving negative information and participating in front-line work appear to be important risk factors for psychological problems.\n\n The psychological health of different healthcare workers should be protected during the COVID-19 pandemic with timely interventions and proper information feedback.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7299004","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jianyu","surname":"Que","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Le","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Le","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiahui","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiajia","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suying","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yimiao","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weizhen","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kai","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yankun","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Maosheng","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Bao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}],"References

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Collaboration

study","abstract":"The goal of this research is to test whether often observed correlates of loneliness in older age are related to onset of loneliness longitudinally.\n Despite the increasing number of longitudinal studies, the investigation of factors that are related to onset of loneliness is still limited.\n Analyses are based on data of the TamELSA study, which is a population-based prospective study in Tampere, Finland and started in 1979. For the present study 469 older adults aged between 60 and 86 years at baseline, who were not lonely at baseline, were selected and followed-up in 1989, 1999 and 2006. During the 28 years of follow-up approximately one third (N = 178) of the study population developed feelings of loneliness.\n Logistic regression analyses indicated that losing a partner, reduced social activities, increased physical disabilities, increased feelings of low mood, uselessness and nervousness, rather than baseline characteristics, are related to enhanced feelings of loneliness at follow-up.\n The higher incidence of loneliness among women can be fully explained by the unequal distribution of risk factors among men and women (e.\ng.\n, women more often become widowed).\n Our results are in line with the cognitive approach that conceptualizes loneliness as an unpleasant feeling due to a perceived discrepancy between the desired and the achieved level of social and personal resources.\n","id":"PMC3047676","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marja","surname":"Aartsen","email":"m.j.aartsen@vu.nl","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marja","surname":"Jylhä","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.apnu.2008.11.002","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Predictors

undergoing hemodialysis and university hospital workers who treated patients Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) during its outbreak.\n\n\nDesign\nThe group of subjects consisted of 1800 hospital practitioners and 73 quarantined patients undergoing hemodialysis.\n\n The Impact of Events ScaleRevised (IES-R) was administered to the practitioners twice, once during the hospital shutdown and again one month after the shutdown.\n\n The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered to patients undergoing hemodialysis.\n\n\nResults\nDuring the initial stages of the MERS outbreak, healthcare workers who performed MERS-related tasks scored significantly higher on the total IES-R and its subscales.\n\n In the second assessment of the high-risk group, the sleep and numbness subscale scores from the IES-R differed depending on the implementation of home quarantine, and the intrusion subscale scores differed depending on the performance of MERS-related tasks.\n\n\nConclusion\nMedical staff that performed MERS-related tasks showed the highest risk for post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms even after time had elapsed.\n\n The risk increased even after home quarantine.\n\n Prompt and continuous psychiatric intervention is needed in high mortality infectious disease

psychological adaptation of the nurses in a structured SARS caring unit during outbreak: A prospective and periodic assessment study in Taiwan","abstract":"To assess the rapidly changing psychological status of nurses during the acute phase of the 2003 SARS outbreak, we conducted a prospective and periodic evaluation of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation among nurses in SARS units and non-SARS units.\n Nurse participants were from two SARS units (regular SARS [N = 44] and SARS ICU [N = 26]) and two non-SARS units (Neurology [N = 15] and CCU [N = 17]).\n Participants periodically self-evaluated their depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, sleep disturbance, attitude towards SARS and family support.\n Results showed that depression (38.5% vs.\n 3.1%) and insomnia (37% vs.\n 9.7%) were, respectively, greater in the SARS unit nurses than the non-SARS unit nurses.\n No difference between these two groups was found in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (33% vs.\n 18.7%), yet, three unit subjects (SARS ICU, SARS regular and Neurology) had significantly higher rate than those in CCU (29.7% vs.\n 11.8%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05).\n For the SARS unit nurses, significant reduction in mood ratings, insomnia rate and perceived negative feelings as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of SARS at the end of the study (all p &lt; 0.001) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred.\n The adjustment of nurses in the more structured SARS ICU environment, where nurses care for even more severely ill patients, may have been as good or better than that of nurses in the regular SARS unit.\n Occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was linked to direct exposure to SARS patient care, previous mood disorder history, younger age and perceived negative feelings.\n Positive coping attitude and strong social and family support may have protected against acute stress.\n In conclusion, the psychological impact on the caring staffs facing future bio-disaster will be minimized with lowered risk factors and a safer and more structured work environment.\n","id":"PMC7094424","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tung-Ping","surname":"Su","email":"tpsu@vghtpe.gov.tw","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Te-Cheng","surname":"Lien","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chih-Yi","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yiet

Syndrome","abstract":"OBJECTIVES\nIsolation due to the management of infectious diseases is thought to affect mental health, but the effects are still unknown.\n\n We examined the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and anger in persons isolated during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic both at isolation period and at four to six months after release from isolation.\n\n We also determined risk factors associated with these symptoms at four to six months.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOf 14,992 individuals isolated for 2-week due to having contact with MERS patients in 2015, when MERS was introduced to Korea, 1,692 individuals were included in this study.\n\n Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and anger was assessed with the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory at four to six months after release from isolation for MERS.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 1,692 who came in contact with MERS patients, 1,656 were not diagnosed with MERS.\n\n Among 1,656, anxiety symptoms showed 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3 to 8.9%) and feelings of anger were present in 16.6% (95% CI, 14.8 to 18.4%) during the isolation period.\n\n At four to six months after release from isolation, anxiety symptoms were observed in 3.0% (95%CI, 2.2 to 3.9%).\n\n Feelings of anger were present in 6.4% (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.6%).\n\n Risk factors for experiencing anxiety symptoms and anger at four to six months after release included symptoms related to MERS during isolation, inadequate supplies (food, clothes, accommodation), social networking activities (email, text, Internet), history of psychiatric illnesses, and financial loss.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMental health problems at four to six month after release from isolation might be prevented by providing mental health support to individuals with vulnerable mental health, and providing accurate information as well as appropriate supplies, including food, clothes, and accommodation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5177805","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hyunsuk","surname":"Jeong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hyeon

post-outbreak levels of depressive symptoms and the relationship between those depressive symptom levels and the types of outbreak event exposures experienced.\n\n\nMethods\nIn 2006, randomly selected employees (N = 549) of a hospital in Beijing were surveyed concerning their exposures to the city's 2003 SARS outbreak and the ways in which the outbreak had affected their mental health.\n\n Subjects were assessed on sociodemographic factors, on types of exposure to the outbreak, and on symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression.\n\n\nResults\nThe results of multinomial regression analyses showed that, with other relevant factors controlled for, being single, having been quarantined during the outbreak, having been exposed to other traumatic events before SARS, and perceived SARS-related risk level during the outbreak were found to increase the odds of having a high level of depressive symptoms 3 years later.\n\n Altruistic acceptance of risk during the outbreak was found to decrease the odds of high post-outbreak depressive symptom levels.\n\n\nConclusions\nPolicy makers and mental health professionals working to prepare for potential disease outbreaks should be aware that the experience of being quarantined can, in some cases, lead to long-term adverse mental health

and associated psychological distress during the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic","abstract":"Background\nHealth care workers (HCWs) presented frequent concerns regarding their health and their families' health and high levels of psychological distress during previous disease outbreaks, such as the SARS outbreak, which was associated with social isolation and intentional absenteeism.\n\n We aimed to assess HCWs concerns and anxiety, perceived sufficiency of information, and intended behavior during the recent A/H1N1 influenza pandemic and their associations with psychological distress.\n\n\nMethod\nBetween September 1st and 30th, 2009, 469 health-care workers (HCWs) of a tertiary teaching hospital completed a 20-item questionnaire regarding concerns and worries about the new A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, along with Cassileth's Information Styles Questionnaire (part-I) and the GHQ-28.\nResults\nMore than half of the present study's HCWs (56.7%) reported they were worried about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, their degree of anxiety being moderately high (median 6/9).\n\n The most frequent concern was infection of family and friends and the health consequences of the disease (54.9%).\n\n The perceived risk of being infected was considered moderately high (median 6/9).\n\n Few HCWs (6.6%) had restricted their social contacts and fewer (3.8%) felt isolated by their family members and friends because of their hospital work, while a low percentage (4.3%) indented to take a leave to avoid infection.\n\n However, worry and degree of worry were significantly associated with intended absenteeism (p &lt; 0.0005), restriction of social contacts (p &lt; 0.0005), and psychological distress (p = 0.036).\n\n Perceived sufficiency of information about several aspects of the A/H1N1 influenza was moderately high, and the overall information about the A/H1N1 influenza was considered clear (median 7.4/9).\n\n Also, perceived sufficiency of information for the prognosis of the infection was significantly independently associated with the degree of worry about the pandemic (p = 0.008).\n\n\nConclusions\nA significant proportion of HCWs experienced moderately high anxiety about the pandemic, and their degree of worry was an independent correlate of psychological distress.\n\n Since perceived sufficiency of information about the A/H1N1 influenza prognosis was associated with reduced degree of worry, hospital managers and consultation-liaison psychiatry services should try to provide for HCWs' need for information, in order to offer favourable working conditions in times of extreme distress, such as the current and future pandemics.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2990753","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Panagiota","surname":"Goulia","email":"panagiotagoulia@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christos","surname":"Mantas","email":"chmantas@cc.uoi.gr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Danai","surname":"Dimitroula","email":"danaed75@otenet.gr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dimitrios","surname":"Mantis","email":"mantisdi@otenet.gr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Hyphantis","email":"tyfantis@cc.uoi.gr","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/1043659619881491","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychological

Of the 38 studies that compared psychological outcomes of healthcare workers in direct contact with affected patients, 25 contained data that could be combined in a pairwise meta-analysis comparing healthcare workers at high and low risk of exposure.\n\n Compared with lower risk controls, staff in contact with affected patients had greater levels of both acute or post-traumatic stress (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.29) and psychological distress (1.74, 1.50 to 2.03), with similar results for continuous outcomes.\n\n These findings were the same as in the other studies not included in the meta-analysis.\n\n Risk factors for psychological distress included being younger, being more junior, being the parents of dependent children, or having an infected family member.\n\n Longer quarantine, lack of practical support, and stigma also contributed.\n\n Clear communication, access to adequate personal protection, adequate rest, and both practical and psychological support were associated with reduced morbidity.\n\n\nConclusions\nEffective interventions are available to help mitigate the psychological distress experienced by staff caring for patients in an emerging disease outbreak.\n\n These interventions were similar despite the wide range of settings and types of outbreaks covered in this review, and thus could be applicable to the current covid-19

psychological stress.\n\n The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China.\n\n The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD).\n\n Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nWe received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants.\n\n 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS.\n\n 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n\n Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience.\n\n Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of

to understand the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety and depression symptoms in first-line anti-epidemic medical staff and their coping styles for these negative emotions.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gansu (China), with a questionnaire packet which consisted of the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ).\n\n A total of 79 doctors and 86 nurses participated in the survey.\n\n Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between SAS, SDS, and SCSQ score.\n\n A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively.\n\n History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression.\n\n The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively.\n\n History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses.\n\n The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the total score of positive coping was negatively correlated with the total score of anxiety (r=-0.182, p=0.002) and depression (r=-0.253, p=0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe first-line anti-epidemic medical staff have high anxiety and depression symptoms and adopting positive coping

(Sars-CoV-2) and COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) have caused an emergency status in the health system, including in the dentistry environment.\n Italy registered the third highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world and the second highest in Europe.\n An anonymous online survey composed of 40 questions has been sent to dentists practicing in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia, one of the areas in Italy most affected by COVID-19. The survey was aimed at highlighting the practical and emotional consequences of COVID-19 emergence on daily clinical practice.\n Specifically, it assessed dentists behavioral responses, emotions and concerns following the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic restrictive measures introduced by the Italian national administrative order of 10 March 2020 (DM-10M20), as well as the dentists perception of infection likelihood for themselves and patients.\n Furthermore, the psychological impact of COVID-19 was assessed by means of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 test (GAD-7), that measures the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms.\n Using local dental associations (ANDI-Associazione Nazionale Dentisti Italiani, CAO-Commissione Albo Odontoiatri) lists, the survey was sent by email to all dentists in the district of Modena and Reggio Emilia (874 practitioners) and was completed by 356 of them (40%).\n All dental practitioners closed or reduced their activity to urgent procedures, 38.2% prior to and 61.8% after the DM-10M20.

Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 6271% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.\n Other biocidal agents such as 0.050.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.\n As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.\n","id":"PMC7132493","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"G.","surname":"Kampf","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"D.","surname":"Todt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Pfaender","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"E.","surname":"Steinmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/archinte.166.10.1092","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

anxiety and fear of getting infected among dentists while working during the current novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) outbreak.\n In addition, dentists knowledge about various practice modifications to combat COVID-19 has been evaluated.\n A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from 10th to 17th March 2020. The well-constructed questionnaire was designed and registered at online website (Kwiksurveys) and validated.\n A total of 669 participants from 30 different countries across the world responded.\n After scrutiny, completed questionnaires (n = 650) were included in the study.\n Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. Chi-Square and Spearman correlation tests were applied to control confounders and assess the relation of dentists response with respect to gender and educational level.\n More than two-thirds of the general dental practitioners (78%) from 30 countries questioned were anxious and scared by the devastating effects of COVID-19. A large number of dentists (90%) were aware of recent changes in the treatment protocols.\n However, execution of amended treatment protocol was recorded as 61%.\n The majority of the dentists (76%) were working in the hospital setting out of which 74% were from private, and 20% were from government setups.\n Individually we received a large number of responses from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, but collectively more than 50% of the responses were from other parts of the world.\n Despite having a high standard of knowledge and practice, dental practitioners around the globe are in a state of anxiety and fear while working in their respective fields due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on humanity.\n A number of dental practices have either modified their services according to the recommended guidelines to emergency treatment only or closed down practices for an uncertain period.\n","id":"PMC7216192","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Muhammad Adeel","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rizwan","surname":"Jouhar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rizwan","surname":"Jouhar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Naseer","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Naseer","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samira","surname":"Adnan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samira","surname":"Adnan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marziya","surname":"Aftab","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Muhammad Sohail","surname":"Zafar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zohaib","surname":"Khurshid","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zohaib","surname":"Khurshid","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jiph.2016.06.002","date":"2016-06-24","title":"Cross-infection and infection control in dentistry: Knowledge, attitude and practice of patients attended dental clinics in King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","abstract":"The objective of the study was to determine the level of Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) of patients attended dental clinics at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH) regarding cross infections and infection control in dentistry.\n A cross-sectional study was conducted among 225 patients who attended the dental clinics of KAUH, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 2014.

research needs","abstract":"Research on respiratory protection against biologic agents is important to address major concerns such as occupational safety and terrorist attack.\n This review describes the literature on respiratory protection against bioaerosols and identifies research gaps.\n Respiratory protection is a complex field involving a number of factors, such as the efficiency of respirator filter material; face-piece fitting; and maintenance, storage, and reuse of respirators.\n Several studies used nonpathogenic microorganisms having physical characteristics similar to that of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to analyze microbial penetration through respirators.\n Some studies showed that high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and N95 filters provided a higher level of protection than dust/mist (DM) and dust/mist/fume (DMF) filters.\n Flow rate and relative humidity appear to alter the level of penetration of microorganisms through respirator filters.\n The relationship between microbial penetration through respirator filters and the aerodynamic diameter, length, or other physical characteristics of microorganisms remains controversial.\n Whether reaerosolization of bioaerosol particles should be a concern is unclear, given the fact that one study has demonstrated significant reaerosolization of 1- to 5-?m particles loaded onto respirator filters.\n Respirator maintenance, storage, and decontamination are important factors to be considered when reusing respirators.\n The respiratory protection against biologic warfare agents such as anthrax in military and civilian situations is described.\n","id":"PMC7118892","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Appavoo","surname":"Rengasamy","email":"rda5@cdc.gov","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ziqing","surname":"Zhuang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roland","surname":"BerryAnn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychological

Professionals in Wuhan, China: Cross-Sectional Survey","abstract":"Background\nThe mental health consequences of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, community-wide interventions, and social media use during a pandemic are unclear.\n\n The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan.\n\n Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff ?3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff ?3), respectively.\n\n A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2).\n\n Similarly, of the 214 health professionals, about one-fifth of surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (n=47, 22.0%, 95% CI 16.6-28.1) or probable depression (n=41, 19.2%, 95% CI 14.1-25.1).\n\n Around one-third of community-based adults and health professionals spent ?2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media.\n\n Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending ?2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults.\n\n Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks.\n\n Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental health.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7219721","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edson","surname":"Da

Sierra Leone, July 2015","abstract":"Background\nThe mental health impact of the 20142016 Ebola epidemic has been described among survivors, family members and healthcare workers, but little is known about its impact on the general population of affected countries.\n\n We assessed symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the general population in Sierra Leone after over a year of outbreak response.\n\n\nMethods\nWe administered a cross-sectional survey in July 2015 to a national sample of 3564 consenting participants selected through multistaged cluster sampling.\n\n Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-4. PTSD symptoms were measured by six items from the Impact of Events Scale-revised.\n\n Relationships among Ebola experience, perceived Ebola threat and mental health symptoms were examined through binary logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nPrevalence of any anxiety-depression symptom was 48% (95% CI 46.8% to 50.0%), and of any PTSD symptom 76% (95% CI 75.0% to 77.8%).\n\n In addition, 6% (95% CI 5.4% to 7.0%) met the clinical cut-off for anxiety-depression, 27% (95% CI 25.8% to 28.8%) met levels of clinical concern for PTSD and 16% (95% CI 14.7% to 17.1%) met levels of probable PTSD diagnosis.\n\n Factors associated with higher reporting of any symptoms in bivariate analysis included region of residence, experiences with Ebola and perceived Ebola threat.\n\n Knowing someone quarantined for Ebola was independently associated with anxiety-depression (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.3, 95%?CI 1.7 to 2.9) and PTSD (AOR 2.095% CI 1.5 to 2.8) symptoms.\n\n Perceiving Ebola as a threat was independently associated with anxiety-depression (AOR 1.69 95% CI 1.44 to 1.98) and PTSD (AOR 1.86 95% CI 1.56 to 2.21) symptoms.\n\n\nConclusion\nSymptoms of PTSD and anxiety-depression were common after one year of Ebola response; psychosocial support may be needed for people with Ebola-related experiences.\n\n Preventing, detecting, and responding to mental health conditions should be an important component of global health security efforts.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5873549","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mohamed

problems, but also caused great psychological distress, especially for medical staff.\n\n We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n\nMethod\nMedical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers.\n\n The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms.\n\n We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms.\n\n\nResult\nThere were a total of 1,563 participants in our study.\n\n Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score ? 8).\n\n A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.07.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.20.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.02.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = 1.63.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.33.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.38.5).\n\n\nConclusion\nOur study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor.\n\n Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various sociopsychological factors at play in this situation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7171048","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chenxi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Shuai","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Simeng","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongxiang","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiting","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lijun","surname":"Kang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meilei","surname":"Su","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jihui","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhongchun","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

Gardens","abstract":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) possesses characteristics that render it particularly prone to stigmatization.\n SARS-related stigma, despite its salience for public health and stigma research, has had little examination.\n This study combines survey and case study methods to examine subjective stigma among residents of Amoy Gardens (AG), the first officially recognized site of community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong.\n A total of 903 residents of AG completed a self-report questionnaire derived from two focus groups conducted toward the end of the 3-month outbreak.\n Case studies of two residents who lived in Block E, the heart of the SARS epidemic at AG, complement the survey data.\n Findings show that stigma affected most residents and took various forms of being shunned, insulted, marginalized, and rejected in the domains of work, interpersonal relationships, use of services and schooling.\n Stigma was also associated with psychosomatic distress.\n Residents strategies for diminishing stigma varied with gender, age, education, occupation, and proximity to perceived risk factors for SARS such as residential location, previous SARS infection and the presence of ex-SARS household members.\n Residents attributed stigma to government mismanagement, contagiousness of the mysterious SARS virus, and alarmist media reporting.\n Stigma clearly decreased, but never completely disappeared, after the outbreak.\n The findings confirm and add to existing knowledge on the varied origins, correlates, and impacts of stigma.\n They also highlight the synergistic roles of inconsistent health policy responses and risk miscommunication by the media in rapidly amplifying stigma toward an unfamiliar illness.\n While recognizing the intrinsically stigmatizing nature of public health measures to control SARS, we recommend that a consistent inter-sectoral approach is needed to minimize stigma and to make an effective health response to future outbreaks.\n","id":"PMC7116975","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sing","surname":"Lee","email":"singlee@cuhk.edu.hk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lydia

of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation of the nurses in a structured SARS caring unit during outbreak: A prospective and periodic assessment study in Taiwan","abstract":"To assess the rapidly changing psychological status of nurses during the acute phase of the 2003 SARS outbreak, we conducted a prospective and periodic evaluation of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation among nurses in SARS units and non-SARS units.\n Nurse participants were from two SARS units (regular SARS [N = 44] and SARS ICU [N = 26]) and two non-SARS units (Neurology [N = 15] and CCU [N = 17]).\n Participants periodically self-evaluated their depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, sleep disturbance, attitude towards SARS and family support.\n Results showed that depression (38.5% vs.\n 3.1%) and insomnia (37% vs.\n 9.7%) were, respectively, greater in the SARS unit nurses than the non-SARS unit nurses.\n No difference between these two groups was found in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (33% vs.\n 18.7%), yet, three unit subjects (SARS ICU, SARS regular and Neurology) had significantly higher rate than those in CCU (29.7% vs.\n 11.8%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05).\n For the SARS unit nurses, significant reduction in mood ratings, insomnia rate and perceived negative feelings as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of SARS at the end of the study (all p &lt; 0.001) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred.\n The adjustment of nurses in the more structured SARS ICU environment, where nurses care for even more severely ill patients, may have been as good or better than that of nurses in the regular SARS unit.\n Occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was linked to direct exposure to SARS patient care, previous mood disorder history, younger age and perceived negative feelings.\n Positive coping attitude and strong social and family support may have protected against acute stress.\n In conclusion, the psychological impact on the caring staffs facing future bio-disaster will be minimized with lowered risk factors and a safer and more structured work environment.\n","id":"PMC7094424","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tung-Ping","surname":"Su","email":"tpsu@vghtpe.gov.tw","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Te-Cheng","surname":"Lien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chih-Yi","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yiet

psychosocial variables and working conditions, and nurses coping methods and distress in response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis in Canada.\n\n\nParticipants and procedure\nThe sample consisted of 333 nurses (315 women, 18 men) who completed an Internet-mediated questionnaire that was posted on the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO) website between March and May 2004. The questionnaire was restricted to respondents who had to authenticate their RNAO membership with a valid username and password before accessing the questionnaire.\n\n This served a dual purpose: to ensure that only RNAO nurses completed the questionnaire and thereby safeguarding the generalizability of the findings; and second, to prevent any one nurse from contributing more than once to the overall sample.\n\n\nResults\nCorrelational analysis yielded several significant relationships between psychosocial variables and working conditions, and the traditional correlates of burnout and stress.\n\n Three multiple regression analysis revealed that the model we evolvedincluding higher levels of vigor, organizational support, and trust in equipment/infection control initiative; and lower levels of contact with SARS patients, and time spent in quarantinepredicted to lower levels of avoidance behavior, emotional exhaustion, and state anger.\n\n\nConclusions\nBy employing models of stress and burnout that combine psychosocial variables and working conditions, researchers can account for significant amounts of variance in outcomes related to burnout.\n\n These findings highlight the importance of vigor and perceived organizational support in predicting nurses symptoms of burnout.\n\n For healthcare administrators, this means that a likely strategy for assuaging the negative outcomes of stress should address nurses psychosocial concerns and the working conditions that they face during novel times of crisis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094220","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zdravko","surname":"Marjanovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Esther

HCWs experienced psychological distress, particularly increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS).\n\n Factors contributing to increased distress in HCWs working in high-risk areas treating patients with SARS have not been fully elucidated.\n\n The goal of this study was to quantify the psychological effects of working in a high-risk unit during the SARS outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nHCWs in a Toronto hospital who worked in high-risk areas completed a questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the SARS crisis along with the Impact of Event ScaleRevised, which screens for PTSS.\n\n The comparison group consisted of clinical units that had no contact with patients infected with SARS.\n\n\nResults\nFactors that were identified to cause distress in the 248 respondent HCWs were the following: (a) perception of risk to themselves, (b) impact of the SARS crisis on their work life, (c) depressive affect, and (d) working in a high-risk unit.\n\n In addition, HCWs who cared for only one SARS patient in comparison to those caring for multiple SARS patients experienced more PTSS.\n\n\nConclusions\nAs expected, HCWs who were working in high-risk units experienced greater distress.\n\n Contrary to expectations, HCWs who experienced greater contact with SARS patients while working in the high-risk units were less distressed.\n\n This suggests that HCW experience in treating patients infected with SARS may be a mediating factor that could be amenable to intervention in future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094601","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rima","surname":"Styra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Hawryluck","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Robinson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sonja","surname":"Kasapinovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Calvin","surname":"Fones","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wayne

insomnia has been scarce.\n\n This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of brief e-aid cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (eCBTI) in preventing transition from episodic insomnia to persistent insomnia.\n\n\nMethods and analysis\nThis is a pragmatic two-arm multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing eCBTI with treatment as usual (TAU) in outpatients.\n\n Two hundred patients with episodic insomnia (as defined by DSM-5) will be recruited.\n\n Patients will be randomly assigned to receive 1?week eCBTI via a Smartphone application, or to receive TAU.\n\n Treatment effects will be assessed at 1?week and 3 months after intervention.\n\n The primary outcome of the study, whether the eCBTI program is sufficient in preventing transition from short-term to persistent insomnia, is measured by the Insomnia Severity Index.\n\n Secondary outcome measurements include the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale, Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test, Sleep Hygiene and Practices Scale, Pre-sleep Arousal Scale and Epworth Sleepiness Scale.\n\n Additionally, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Short-Form 12-Item Health Survey will be used for

Middle Income Countries: A Systematic Review","abstract":"Background\nA wide range of screening tools are available to detect common mental disorders (CMDs), but few have been specifically developed for populations in low and middle income countries (LMIC).\n\n Cross-cultural application of a screening tool requires that its validity be assessed against a gold standard diagnostic interview.\n\n Validation studies of brief CMD screening tools have been conducted in several LMIC, but until now there has been no review of screening tools for all CMDs across all LMIC populations.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic review with broad inclusion criteria was conducted, producing a comprehensive summary of brief CMD screening tools validated for use in LMIC populations.\n\n For each validation, the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was calculated as an easily comparable measure of screening tool validity.\n\n Average DOR results weighted by sample size were calculated for each screening tool, enabling us to make broad recommendations about best performing screening tools.\n\n\nResults\n153 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria.\n\n Because many studies validated two or more screening tools, this corresponded to 273 separate validations against gold standard diagnostic criteria.\n\n We found that the validity of every screening tool tested in multiple settings and populations varied between studies, highlighting the importance of local validation.\n\n Many of the best performing tools were purposely developed for a specific population; however, as these tools have only been validated in one study, it is not possible to draw broader conclusions about their applicability in other contexts.\n\n\nConclusions\nOf the tools that have been validated in multiple settings, the authors broadly recommend using the SRQ-20 to screen for general CMDs, the GHQ-12 for CMDs in populations with physical illness, the HADS-D for depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 for depressive disorders in populations with good literacy levels, the EPDS for perinatal depressive disorders, and the HADS-A for anxiety disorders.\n\n We recommend that, wherever possible, a chosen screening tool should be validated against a gold standard diagnostic assessment in the specific context in which it will be employed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4911088","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gemma-Claire","surname":"Ali","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Grace","surname":"Ryan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Grace","surname":"Ryan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mary

in older people: validity of the General Health Questionnaire, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the self-completion version of the revised Clinical Interview Schedule","abstract":"Background\nDiagnosis of depressive disorder using interviewer-administered instruments is expensive and frequently impractical in large epidemiological surveys.\n\n The aim of this study was to assess the validity of three self-completion measures of depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders in older people against an interviewer-administered instrument.\n\n\nMethod\nA random sample stratified by sex, age and social position was selected from the Whitehall II study participants.\n\n This sample was supplemented by inclusion of depressed Whitehall II participants.\n\n Depressive disorder and other mental disorders were assessed by the interviewer-administered structured revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) in 277 participants aged 5880 years.\n\n Participants also completed a computerized self-completion version of the CIS-R in addition to the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).\n\n\nResults\nThe mean total score was similar for the interviewer-administered (4.43) and self-completion (4.35) versions of the CIS-R [95% confidence interval (CI) for difference ?0.31 to 0.16].\n\n Differences were not related to sex, age, social position or presence of chronic physical illness.\n\n Sensitivity/specificity of self-completion CIS-R was 74%/98% for any mental disorder and 75%/98% for depressive episode.\n\n The corresponding figures were 86%/87% and 78%/83% for GHQ and 77%/89% and 89%/86% for CES-D.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe self-completion computerized version of the CIS-R is feasible and has good validity as a measure of any mental disorder and depression in people aged ? 60 years.\n\n GHQ and CES-D also have good criterion validity as measures of any mental disorder and depressive disorder respectively.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3821376","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"J.","surname":"Head","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.

university students in four European countries  Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nMental disorders and their symptoms are highly prevalent in the university student population, and the transition from secondary to tertiary education is associated with a rise in mental health problems.\n\n Existing web-based interventions for the prevention of common mental disorders in student populations often focus on just one disorder and have not been designed specifically for students.\n\n There is thus a need for transdiagnostic, student-specific preventative interventions that can be widely disseminated.\n\n This two-arm, parallel group randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a web-based transdiagnostic mental health problem prevention programme (PLUS) across several universities in four countries.\n\n\nMethod\nStudents (N?=?5550) will be recruited through a variety of channels and asked to complete a personality assessment to determine whether they are at high risk for developing common mental disorders.\n\n Students at high risk will be randomly allocated to either PLUS or a control intervention, which provides practical support around issues commonly experienced at university.\n\n Students at low risk will be allocated to the control intervention.\n\n Both intervention groups will be assessed at baseline, 4?weeks, 3?months, 6?months and 12?months after randomisation.\n\n Depression and generalised anxiety, assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scales, will form the primary outcomes in this study.\n\n Secondary outcome measures include alcohol and drug use, eating behaviour, self-esteem, and quality of life.\n\n The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be evaluated.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study will contribute to understanding the role of transdiagnostic indicated web-based interventions for the prevention of common mental disorders in university students.\n\n It will also be one of the first studies to investigate the cost-effectiveness of such interventions.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nThis trial was registered in the ISRCTN register (ISRCTN15570935) on 12th February

Eye of the Beholder","abstract":"To use a diagnostic test effectively and consistently in their practice, clinicians need to know how well the test distinguishes between those patients who have the suspected acute or chronic disease and those patients who do not.\n Clinicians are equally interested and usually more concerned whether, based on the results of a screening test, a given patient actually: (1) does or does not have the suspected disease; or (2) will or will not subsequently experience the adverse event or outcome.\n Medical tests that are performed to screen for a risk factor, diagnose a disease, or to estimate a patients prognosis are frequently a key component of a clinical research study.\n Like therapeutic interventions, medical tests require proper analysis and demonstrated efficacy before being incorporated into routine clinical practice.\n This basic statistical tutorial, thus, discusses the fundamental concepts and techniques related to diagnostic testing and medical decision-making, including sensitivity and specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, positive and negative likelihood ratio, receiver operating characteristic curve, diagnostic accuracy, choosing a best cut-point for a continuous variable biomarker, comparing methods on diagnostic accuracy, and design of a diagnostic accuracy

were recruited.\n\n Of these, 147 were included in the analysis; 83 online and 64 paper-based.\n\n The remaining 13 were excluded because of incomplete data.\n\n\nMeasures\nDepression and anxiety were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).\n\n Data on pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s %) and body mass index were self-reported based on clinical assessments.\n\n Sociodemographic data were collected.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with the paper-based participants, the online participants were more likely to be female (61.7% vs 48.4%), older (mean 32.2 vs 28.2 years) and were more likely to be married (32.5% vs 15.6%), living with their spouse or partner (42.5% vs 22.6%) and working either full time (33.7% vs 15.9%) or part time (30.1%vs 17.5%).\n\n The prevalence rates of elevated anxiety and depression were not significantly different (P=0.71 and P=0.56).\n\n HADS anxiety and depression scores were not statistically different between online (P=0.83) and paper-based (P=0.92) participants based on Mann-Whitney U test.\n\n A significant negative correlation was found between depression and pulmonary function (r=?0.39, P=0.01)

individuals with CF and parent caregivers have been associated with decreased lung function, lower body mass index, worse adherence, worse health-related quality of life, more frequent hospitalisations and increased healthcare costs.\n To identify and treat depression and anxiety in CF, the CF Foundation and the European CF Society invited a panel of experts, including physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, a pharmacist, parents and an individual with CF, to develop consensus recommendations for clinical care.\n Over 18?months, this 22-member committee was divided into four workgroups: Screening; Psychological Interventions; Pharmacological Treatments and Implementation and Future Research, and used the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome methodology to develop questions for literature search and review.\n Searches were conducted in PubMed, PsychINFO, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Psychiatry online and ABDATA by a methodologist at Dartmouth.\n The committee reviewed 344 articles, drafted statements and set an 80% acceptance for each recommendation statement as a consensus threshold prior to an anonymous voting process.\n Fifteen guideline recommendation statements for screening and treatment of depression and anxiety in individuals with CF and parent caregivers were finalised by vote.\n As these recommendations are implemented in CF centres internationally, the process of dissemination, implementation and resource provision should be closely monitored to assess barriers and concerns, validity

of Two Depression Instruments (BDI-II and MADRS-S) Administered to Clinic Patients","abstract":"Background\nSelf-report measures can guide clinical decisions and are useful when evaluating treatment outcomes.\n\n However, many clinicians do not use self-report measures systematically in their clinical practice.\n\n Internet-based questionnaires could facilitate administration, but the psychometric properties of the online version of an instrument should be explored before implementation.\n\n The recommendation from the International Test Commission is to test the psychometric properties of each questionnaire separately.\n\n\nObjective\nOur objective was to compare the psychometric properties of paper-and-pencil versions and Internet versions of two questionnaires measuring depressive symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nThe 87 participating patients were recruited from primary care and psychiatric care within the public health care system in Sweden.\n\n Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating ScaleSelf-rated (MADRS-S), both on paper and on the Internet.\n\n The order was randomized to control for order effects.\n\n Symptom severity in the sample ranged from mild to severe depressive symptoms.\n\n\nResults\nPsychometric properties of the two administration formats were mostly equivalent.\n\n The internal consistency was similar for the Internet and paper versions, and significant correlations were found between the formats for both MADRS-S (r = .\n\n84) and the BDI-II (r = .\n\n89).\n\n Differences between paper and Internet total scores were not statistically significant for either questionnaire nor for the MADRS-S question dealing with suicidality (item 9) when analyzed separately.\n\n The score on the BDI-II question about suicidality (item 9) was significantly lower when administered via the Internet compared with the paper score, but the difference was small (effect size, Cohens [d] = 0.14).\n\n There were significant main effects for order of administration on both questionnaires and significant interaction effects between format and order.\n\n This should not, however, pose a problem in clinical use as long as the administration format is not changed when repeated measurements are made.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe MADRS-S can be transferred to online use without affecting the psychometric properties in a clinically meaningful way.\n\n The full BDI-II also seems to retain its properties when transferred; however, the item measuring suicidality in the Internet version needs further investigation since it was associated with a lower score in this study.\n\n The use of online questionnaires offers clinicians a more practical way of measuring depressive symptoms and has the potential to save resources.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3057311","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pim","surname":"Cuijpers","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kate","surname":"Cavanagh","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Kate","surname":"Cavanagh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frances","surname":"Kay-Lambkin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fredrik","surname":"Holländare","email":"fredrik.hollandare@orebroll.se","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Fredrik","surname":"Holländare","email":"fredrik.hollandare@orebroll.se","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gerhard","surname":"Andersson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ingemar","surname":"Engström","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/gps.3993","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Piloting

leading role in guiding the production of informed high-quality, timely research evidence syntheses","abstract":"Background\nPolicymakers and healthcare stakeholders are increasingly seeking evidence to inform the policymaking process, and often use existing or commissioned systematic reviews to inform decisions.\n\n However, the methodologies that make systematic reviews authoritative take time, typically 1 to 2 years to complete.\n\n Outside the traditional SR timeline, rapid reviews have emerged as an efficient tool to get evidence to decision-makers more quickly.\n\n However, the use of rapid reviews does present challenges.\n\n To date, there has been limited published empirical information about this approach to compiling evidence.\n\n Thus, it remains a poorly understood and ill-defined set of diverse methodologies with various labels.\n\n In recent years, the need to further explore rapid review methods, characteristics, and their use has been recognized by a growing network of healthcare researchers, policymakers, and organizations, several with ties to Cochrane, which is recognized as representing an international gold standard for high-quality, systematic reviews.\n\n\nPurpose\nIn this commentary, we introduce the newly established Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group developed to play a leading role in guiding the production of rapid reviews given they are increasingly employed as a research synthesis tool to support timely evidence-informed decision-making.\n\n We discuss how the group was formed and outline the groups structure and remit.\n\n We also discuss the need to establish a more robust evidence base for rapid reviews in the published literature, and the importance of promoting registration of rapid review protocols in an effort to promote efficiency and transparency in research.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs with standard systematic reviews, the core principles of evidence-based synthesis should apply to rapid reviews in order

are the best methodologies for rapid reviews of the research evidence for evidence-informed decision making in health policy and practice: a rapid review","abstract":"Background\nRapid reviews have the potential to overcome a key barrier to the use of research evidence in decision making, namely that of the lack of timely and relevant research.\n\n This rapid review of systematic reviews and primary studies sought to answer the question: What are the best methodologies to enable a rapid review of research evidence for evidence-informed decision making in health policy and practice?\nMethods\nThis rapid review utilised systematic review methods and was conducted according to a pre-defined protocol including clear inclusion criteria (PROSPERO registration: CRD42015015998).\n\n A comprehensive search strategy was used, including published and grey literature, written in English, French, Portuguese or Spanish, from 2004 onwards.\n\n Eleven databases and two websites were searched.\n\n Two review authors independently applied the eligibility criteria.\n\n Data extraction was done by one reviewer and checked by a second.\n\n The methodological quality of included studies was assessed independently by two reviewers.\n\n A narrative summary of the results is presented.\n\n\nResults\nFive systematic reviews and one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that investigated methodologies for rapid reviews met the inclusion criteria.\n\n None of the systematic reviews were of sufficient quality to allow firm conclusions to be made.\n\n Thus, the findings need to be treated with caution.\n\n There is no agreed definition of rapid reviews in the literature and no agreed methodology for conducting rapid reviews.\n\n While a wide range of shortcuts are used to make rapid reviews faster than a full systematic review, the included studies found little empirical evidence of their impact on the conclusions of either rapid or systematic reviews.\n\n There is some evidence from the included RCT (that had a low risk of bias) that rapid reviews may improve clarity and accessibility of research evidence for decision makers.\n\n\nConclusions\nGreater care needs to be taken in improving the transparency of the methods used in rapid review products.\n\n There is no evidence available to suggest that rapid reviews should not be done or that they are misleading in any way.\n\n We offer an improved definition of rapid reviews to guide future research as well as clearer guidance for policy and practice.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe

identification methods in systematic reviews","abstract":"Background\nMeta-research studies investigating methods, systems, and processes designed to improve the efficiency of systematic review workflows can contribute to building an evidence base that can help to increase value and reduce waste in research.\n\n This study demonstrates the use of an economic evaluation framework to compare the costs and effects of four variant approaches to identifying eligible studies for consideration in systematic reviews.\n\n\nMethods\nA cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a basic decision-analytic model, to compare the relative efficiency of safety first, double screening, single screening and single screening with text mining approaches in the title-abstract screening stage of a case study systematic review about undergraduate medical education in UK general practice settings.\n\n Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the incremental cost per citation saved from inappropriate exclusion from the review.\n\n Resource use and effect parameters were estimated based on retrospective analysis of review process meta-data curated alongside the case study review, in conjunction with retrospective simulation studies to model the integrated use of text mining.\n\n Unit cost parameters were estimated based on the case study reviews project budget.\n\n A base case analysis was conducted, with deterministic sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of variations in values of key parameters.\n\n\nResults\nUse of single screening with text mining would have resulted in title-abstract screening workload reductions (base case analysis) of &gt;60 % compared with other approaches.\n\n Across modelled scenarios, the safety first approach was, consistently, equally effective and less costly than conventional double screening.\n\n Compared with single screening with text mining, estimated ICERs for the two non-dominated approaches (base case analyses) ranged from £1975 (single screening without a provisionally included code) to £4427 (safety first with a provisionally included code) per citation saved.\n\n Patterns of results were consistent between base case and sensitivity analyses.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlternatives to the conventional double screening approach, integrating text mining, warrant further consideration as potentially more efficient approaches to identifying eligible studies for systematic reviews.\n\n Comparable economic evaluations conducted using other systematic review datasets are needed to determine the generalisability of these findings and to build an evidence base to inform guidance for review

worries, perceived sufficiency of information and associated psychological distress during the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic","abstract":"Background\nHealth care workers (HCWs) presented frequent concerns regarding their health and their families' health and high levels of psychological distress during previous disease outbreaks, such as the SARS outbreak, which was associated with social isolation and intentional absenteeism.\n\n We aimed to assess HCWs concerns and anxiety, perceived sufficiency of information, and intended behavior during the recent A/H1N1 influenza pandemic and their associations with psychological distress.\n\n\nMethod\nBetween September 1st and 30th, 2009, 469 health-care workers (HCWs) of a tertiary teaching hospital completed a 20-item questionnaire regarding concerns and worries about the new A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, along with Cassileth's Information Styles Questionnaire (part-I) and the GHQ-28.\nResults\nMore than half of the present study's HCWs (56.7%) reported they were worried about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, their degree of anxiety being moderately high (median 6/9).\n\n The most frequent concern was infection of family and friends and the health consequences of the disease (54.9%).\n\n The perceived risk of being infected was considered moderately high (median 6/9).\n\n Few HCWs (6.6%) had restricted their social contacts and fewer (3.8%) felt isolated by their family members and friends because of their hospital work, while a low percentage (4.3%) indented to take a leave to avoid infection.\n\n However, worry and degree of worry were significantly associated with intended absenteeism (p &lt; 0.0005), restriction of social contacts (p &lt; 0.0005), and psychological distress (p = 0.036).\n\n Perceived sufficiency of information about several aspects of the A/H1N1 influenza was moderately high, and the overall information about the A/H1N1 influenza was considered clear (median 7.4/9).\n\n Also, perceived sufficiency of information for the prognosis of the infection was significantly independently associated with the degree of worry about the pandemic (p = 0.008).\n\n\nConclusions\nA significant proportion of HCWs experienced moderately high anxiety about the pandemic, and their degree of worry was an independent correlate of psychological distress.\n\n Since perceived sufficiency of information about the A/H1N1 influenza prognosis was associated with reduced degree of worry, hospital managers and consultation-liaison psychiatry services should try to provide for HCWs' need for information, in order to offer favourable working conditions in times of extreme distress, such as the current and future pandemics.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2990753","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Panagiota","surname":"Goulia","email":"panagiotagoulia@yahoo.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christos","surname":"Mantas","email":"chmantas@cc.uoi.gr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Danai","surname":"Dimitroula","email":"danaed75@otenet.gr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dimitrios","surname":"Mantis","email":"mantisdi@otenet.gr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Hyphantis","email":"tyfantis@cc.uoi.gr","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/occmed/kqh027","date":"2003-12-02","title":"Psychological

feeling of low personal accomplishment.\n In this review, we discuss the contributing factors leading to physician burnout and its consequences for the physicians health, patient outcomes, and the healthcare system.\n Physicians face daily challenges in providing care to their patients, and burnout may be from increased stress levels in overworked physicians.\n Additionally, the healthcare system mandates physicians to keep a meticulous record of their physician-patient encounters along with clerical responsibilities.\n Physicians are not well-trained in managing clerical duties, and this might shift their focus from solely caring for their patients.\n This can be addressed by the systematic application of evidence-based interventions, including but not limited to group interventions, mindfulness training, assertiveness training, facilitated discussion groups, and promoting a healthy work environment.\n","id":"PMC6262585","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rikinkumar

and Prevention and other organizations, the educational landscape for surgical residents is rapidly changing.\n\n In addition, the time course of these changes is undefined.\n\n\nMethods\nWe attempt to define the scope of the problem of maintaining surgical resident education while maintaining the safety of residents, educators, and patients.\n\n Within the basic framework of limiting in-person gatherings, postponing or canceling elective operations in hospitals, and limiting rotations between sites, we propose innovative solutions to maintain rigorous education.\n\n\nResults\nWe propose several innovative solutions including the flipped classroom model, online practice questions, teleconferencing in place of in-person lectures, involving residents in telemedicine clinics, procedural simulation, and the facilitated use of surgical videos.\n\n Although there is no substitute for hands-on learning through operative experience and direct patient care, these may be ways to mitigate the loss of learning exposure during this time.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese innovative solutions utilizing technology may help to bridge the educational gap for surgical residents during this unprecedented circumstance.\n\n The support of national organizations may be beneficial in maintaining rigorous surgical education.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270491","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert Connor","surname":"Chick","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guy

Fidelity Testing of the Test@Work Digital Toolkit for Employers on Workplace Health Checks and Opt-In HIV Testing","abstract":"Background: In the UK, few employers offer general health checks for employees, and opt-in HIV testing is rarely included.\n There is a need to provide evidence-based guidance and support for employers around health checks and HIV testing in the workplace.\n An Agile approach was used to develop and evaluate a digital toolkit to facilitate employers understanding about workplace health screening.\n Methods: The Test@Work toolkit development included an online survey (STAGE 1: n = 201), stakeholder consultation (STAGE 2: n = 19), expert peer review (STAGE 3: n = 24), and pilot testing (STAGE 4: n = 20).\n The toolkit includes employer guidance on workplace health promotion, workplace health screening, and confidential opt-in HIV testing with signposting to resources.\n Pilot testing included assessment of fidelity (delivery and engagement) and implementation qualities (attitudes, resources, practicality, acceptability, usability and cost).\n Results: STAGE 1: The vast majority of respondents would consider offering general health checks in the workplace that included confidential opt-in HIV testing, and this view was broadly comparable across organisation types (n = 201; public: 87.8%; private: 89.7%; third: 87.1%).\n STAGES 2 and 3: Stakeholders highlighted essential content considerations: (1) inclusion of the business case for workplace health initiatives, (2) clear pathways to employer responsibilities, and (3) presenting HIV-related information alongside other areas of health.\n With regards presentation, stakeholders proposed that the toolkit should be concise, with clear signposting and be hosted on a trusted portal.\n STAGE 4: Employers were satisfied with the toolkit content, usability and utility.\n The toolkit had high fidelity with regards to delivery and employer engagement.\n Assessment of implementation qualities showed high usability and practicality, with low perceived burden for completion and acceptable cost implications.\n Very few resource challenges were reported, and the toolkit was considered to be appropriate for any type of organisation, irrespective of size or resources.\n Conclusions: Employers perceived the Test@Work toolkit to be useful, meaningful and appropriate for their needs.\n This digital resource could be used to support employers to engage with health screening and opt-in HIV testing within the context of workplace health promotion.\n","id":"PMC6982120","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Holly","surname":"Blake","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"Somerset","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"Somerset","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Catrin","surname":"Evans","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.amepre.2016.06.008","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evaluating

stress.\n\n Previous reviews show a high prevalence of mental disorders among health care workers, but these need updating and inclusion of studies written in Chinese.\n\n The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide updated prevalence estimates for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, benefitting from the inclusion of studies published in Chinese.\n\n\nMethods\nSystematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar and the Chinese databases SinoMed, WanfangMed, CNKI and CQVIP, for studies conducted between December 2019 and August 2020 on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Studies published in both English and Chinese were included.\n\n\nResults\nData on the prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD was pooled across 65 studies involving 97,333 health care workers across 21 countries.\n\n The pooled prevalence of depression was 21.7% (95% CI, 18.3%-25.2%), of anxiety 22.1% (95% CI, 18.2%-26.3%), and of PTSD 21.5% (95% CI, 10.5%-34.9%).\n\n Prevalence estimates are also provided for a mild classification of each disorder.\n\n Pooled prevalence estimates of depression and anxiety were highest in studies conducted in the Middle-East

cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

for the surgical management of gynecological cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic - FRANCOGYN group for the CNGOF<","abstract":"Introduction\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, specific recommendations are required for the management of patients with gynecologic cancer.\n\n\nMaterials and method\nThe FRANCOGYN group of the National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF) convened to develop recommendations based on the consensus conference model.\n\n\nResults\nIf a patient with a gynecologic cancer presents with COVID-19, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days.\n\n For cervical cancer, radiotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy could replace surgery as first-line treatment and the value of lymph node staging should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n For advanced ovarian cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be preferred over primary cytoreduction surgery.\n\n It is legitimate not to perform hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n For patients who are scheduled to undergo interval surgery, chemotherapy can be continued and surgery performed after 6 cycles.\n\n For patients with early stage endometrial cancer of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy combined with a sentinel lymph node procedure is recommended.\n\n Surgery can be postponed for 12 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 12 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy).\n\n For patients of high ESMO risk, the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) should be applied to avoid pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomy.\n\n\nConclusion\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, management of a patient with cancer should be adapted to limit the risks associated with the virus without incurring loss of chance.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7118621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cherif","surname":"Akladios","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Henri","surname":"Azais","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marcos","surname":"Ballester","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sofiane","surname":"Bendifallah","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierre-Adrien","surname":"Bolze","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Bourdel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexandre","surname":"Bricou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geoffroy","surname":"Canlorbe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"Carcopino","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pauline","surname":"Chauvet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Collinet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charles","surname":"Coutant","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yohann","surname":"Dabi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ludivine","surname":"Dion","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tristan","surname":"Gauthier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Olivier","surname":"Graesslin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrille","surname":"Huchon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Martin","surname":"Koskas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederic","surname":"Kridelka","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent","surname":"Lavoue","email":"Vincent.lavoue@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lise","surname":"Lecointre","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthieu","surname":"Mezzadri","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Camille","surname":"Mimoun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lobna","surname":"Ouldamer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emilie","surname":"Raimond","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyril","surname":"Touboul","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1097/TP.0000000000003258","date":"2020-03-31","title":"Global

general community: a prospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nData for front-line health-care workers and risk of COVID-19 are limited.\n\n We sought to assess risk of COVID-19 among front-line health-care workers compared with the general community and the effect of personal protective equipment (PPE) on risk.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a prospective, observational cohort study in the UK and the USA of the general community, including front-line health-care workers, using self-reported data from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application (app) from March 24 (UK) and March 29 (USA) to April 23, 2020. Participants were voluntary users of the app and at first use provided information on demographic factors (including age, sex, race or ethnic background, height and weight, and occupation) and medical history, and subsequently reported any COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n We used Cox proportional hazards modelling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of our primary outcome, which was a positive COVID-19 test.\n\n The COVID Symptom Study app is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04331509.\n\n\nFindings\nAmong 2?035?395 community individuals and 99?795 front-line health-care workers, we recorded 5545 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 34?435?272 person-days.\n\n Compared with the general community, front-line health-care workers were at increased risk for reporting a positive COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 11·61, 95% CI 10·9312·33).\n\n To account for differences in testing frequency between front-line health-care workers and the general community and possible selection bias, an inverse probability-weighted model was used to adjust for the likelihood of receiving a COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 3·40, 95% CI 3·373·43).\n\n Secondary and post-hoc analyses suggested adequacy of PPE, clinical setting, and ethnic background were also important factors.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn the UK and the USA, risk of reporting a positive test for COVID-19 was increased among front-line health-care workers.\n\n Health-care systems should ensure adequate availability of PPE and develop additional strategies to protect health-care workers from COVID-19, particularly those from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic backgrounds.\n\n Additional follow-up of these observational findings is needed.\n\n\nFunding\nZoe Global, Wellcome Trust, Engineering and

imbalance model, directly influence health or if the effects may be mediated by work-related attitudes and behaviors such as workaholism.\n In the present study, 988 employees (55.6% males, mean age 36.09, SD = 9.23) from a large consultant firm participated in a cross-sectional survey assessing work variables such as job demands, job control, social support, effort, reward, and overcommitment.\n Workaholism was also assessed together with eight different health-related outcomes.\n Although direct effects of the work stressors on health were found on most health outcomes, the work-related stressors were overall strongly related to workaholism (R2 = 0.522), which, in turn, was positively related to four (anxiety/insomnia, somatic symptoms, emotional exhaustion, and social dysfunction) of the eight outcome variables.\n Of a total of 40 relationships between work-related stressors and health outcomes, workaholism fully mediated three of these, and partly mediated 12. Overall, the study suggests that the effects of work-related stressors on health in many cases may be mediated by workaholism.\n","id":"PMC5800172","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cecilie

rehabilitation program: differences in burnout profiles, depression, and recovery/resources-stress balance","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Burnout is generally perceived a unified disorder with homogeneous symptomatology across people (exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy).\n\n However, increasing evidence points to intra-individual patterns of burnout symptoms in non-clinical samples such as students, athletes, healthy, and burned-out employees.\n\n Different burnout subtypes might therefore exist.\n\n Yet, burnout subtypes based on burnout profiles have hardly been explored in clinical patients, and the samples investigated in previous studies were rather heterogeneous including patients with various physical, psychological, and social limitations, symptoms, and disabilities.\n\n Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore burnout subtypes based on burnout profiles in clinically diagnosed burnout patients enrolled in an employee rehabilitation program, and to investigate whether the subtypes differ in depression, recovery/resources-stress balance, and sociodemographic characteristics.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>One hundred three patients (66 women, 37 men) with a clinical burnout diagnosis, who were enrolled in a 5 week employee rehabilitation program in two specialized psychosomatic clinics in Austria, completed a series of questionnaires including the Maslach Burnout Inventory  General Survey (MBI-GS), the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Recovery-Stress-Questionnaire for Work.\n\n Cluster analyses with the three MBI-GS subscales as clustering variables were used to identify the burnout subtypes.\n\n Subsequent multivariate/univariate analysis of variance and Pearson chi-square tests were performed to investigate differences in depression, recovery/resources-stress balance, and sociodemographic characteristics.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Three different burnout subtypes were discovered: the exhausted subtype, the exhausted/cynical subtype, and the burned-out subtype.\n\n The burned-out subtype and the exhausted/cynical subtype showed both more severe depression symptoms and a worse recovery/resources-stress balance than the exhausted subtype.\n\n Furthermore, the burned-out subtype was more depressed than the exhausted/cynical subtype, but no difference was observed between these two subtypes with regard to perceived stress, recovery, and resources.\n\n Sociodemographic characteristics were not associated with the subtypes.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>The present study indicates that there are different subtypes in clinical burnout patients (exhausted, exhausted/cynical, and burned-out), which might represent patients at different developmental stages in the burnout cycle.\n\n Future studies need to replicate the current findings, investigate the stability of the symptom patterns, and examine the efficacy of rehabilitation interventions in different subtypes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5773035","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kathrin","surname":"Bauernhofer","email":"kathrin.bauernhofer@uni-graz.at","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniela","surname":"Bassa","email":"daniela.bassa@edu.uni-graz.at","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniela","surname":"Bassa","email":"daniela.bassa@edu.uni-graz.at","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Markus","surname":"Canazei","email":"markus.canazei@bartenbach.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paulino","surname":"Jiménez","email":"paul.jimenez@uni-graz.at","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Manuela","surname":"Paechter","email":"manuela.paechter@uni-graz.at","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ilona","surname":"Papousek","email":"ilona.papousek@uni-graz.at","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Fink","email":"andreas.fink@uni-graz.at","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elisabeth

predicted a high prevalence of anxiety symptoms, which can affect their quality of life and the care that they provide.\n\n However, few studies have been conducted among community healthcare workers in China.\n\n We attempted to explore whether burnout mediates the association between occupational stress and anxiety symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was completed in Liaoning Province, China from November to December 2012. A total of 1,752 healthcare workers from 52 Community Health Centers participated in this study, and all participants were given self-administered questionnaires.\n\n These questionnaires addressed the following aspects: the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the Chinese version of the effort-reward imbalance scale and the Maslach Burnout InventoryGeneral Survey.\n\n Finally, the study included 1,243 effective respondents (effective response rate, 70.95%).\n\n Hierarchical linear regression analysis, performed with SPSS 17.0, was used to estimate the effect of burnout.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of anxiety symptoms among the community healthcare workers was 38.0%.\n\n After adjusting for demographic characteristics, the effortreward ratio and overcommitment positively predicted anxiety symptoms.\n\n Meanwhile, the effortreward ratio and overcommitment were positively related to the emotional exhaustion and cynicism subscales of burnout.\n\n In addition, the emotional exhaustion and cynicism subscales were positively related to anxiety symptoms.\n\n Thus, there is a link between burnout, occupational stress and anxiety symptoms.\n\n\nConclusions\nBurnout mediates the effect of occupational stress on anxiety symptoms.\n\n To effectively reduce the impact of occupational stress on anxiety symptoms, burnout management should be considered.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4161428","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yanwei","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Qu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Soraya","surname":"Seedat","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Soraya","surname":"Seedat","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jad.2018.02.090","date":"1970-01-01","title":"12-month

depression, anxiety, and substance abuse) and feelings of burnout among medical professionals all over the world and this has been shown to be associated with lapses in patient care.\n\n Data from India in this regard are limited.\n\n\nAims:\nTo assess the various psychological problems (depression, perceived stress, and burnout) among medical professionals working in a government-funded tertiary care institute of India.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nAn online e-mail survey was carried out among resident doctors and faculty members (a total of 1721 doctors).\n\n A total of 445 doctors (response rate-27.69%) responded to the survey.\n\n The survey included Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale, and Maslach Burnout Inventory.\n\n\nResults:\nOf the eligible 1607 participants, 445 responders, 376 (77.75%) were resident doctors and 69 (15.5%) were faculty.\n\n As per the PHQ-9, 30.1% of participants were found to have depression and 16.7% of participants reported suicidal ideations.\n\n About two-thirds of the sample experienced moderate level of stress (67.2%) and another 13% of participants reported high level of stress.\n\n More than 90% of the participants reported some level of burnout.\n\n Compared to faculty, higher proportion of the residents reported stress, depression, and burnout.\n\n Presence of depression, stress, or burnout was associated with lower indulgence in recreational activities, experiencing verbal or physical abuse in the hand of patients/caregivers, feelings that seniors do not show empathy toward patients, and seniors do not show empathy toward them.\n\n\nConclusions:\nThe present study suggests that a significantly higher proportion of doctors in Indian setting experience stress, depression, and burnout.\n\n The presence of stress, depression, and burnout is associated with long working hours and negative patient-related outcomes, adverse doctorpatient interactions, and interpersonal interactions among the colleagues.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6102958","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sandeep","surname":"Grover","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Swapnajeet","surname":"Sahoo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ashish","surname":"Bhalla","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ajit","surname":"Avasthi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jad.2012.02.043","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Do

Which criteria are relevant? How valid and reliable are the used tools?\nMethods \nBased on a systematic literature research in 36 databases, studies in English or German language, published since 2004, concerning medical and differential diagnoses, economic impact and ethical aspects of burnout, are included and evaluated.\n\n\nResults \n852 studies are identified.\n\n After considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria and after reviewing the full texts, 25 medical and one ethical study are included.\n\n No economic study met the criteria.\n\n\nDiscussion \nThe evidence of the majority of the studies is predominantly low.\n\n Most of the studies are descriptive and explorative.\n\n Self-assessment tools are mainly used, overall the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI).\n\n Objective data like medical parameters, health status, sick notes or judgements by third persons are extremely seldomly included in the studies.\n\n The sample construction is coincidental in the majority of cases, response rates are often low.\n\n Almost no longitudinal studies are available.\n\n There are insufficient results on the stability and the duration of related symptoms.\n\n The ambiguity of the burnout diagnosis is regularly neglected in the studies.\n\n\nConclusions \nThe authors conclude, that (1) further research, particularly high-quality studies are needed, to broaden the understanding of the burnout syndrome.\n\n Equally (2) a definition of the burnout syndrome has to be found which goes beyond the published understanding of burnout and is based on common scientific consent.\n\n Furthermore, there is a need (3) for finding a standardized, international accepted and valid procedure for the differentiated diagnostics of burnout and for (4) developing a third party assessment tool for the diagnosis of burnout.\n\n Finally, (5) the economic effects and implication of burnout diagnostics on the economy, the health insurances and the patients have to be analysed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3010892","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dieter","surname":"Korczak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Beate","surname":"Huber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Kister","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016009606.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The

been discussed as a major factor explaining and predicting disorders like depression or burnout.\n An unsolved question is whether there are specific personality factors allowing differentiation of burnout from depression.\n The present study tested the relation between one of the most prominent, biological personality theories, Cloningers Temperament and Character Inventory, and common measures of burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory General) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory 2) in a sample of German employees (N?=?944) and a sample of inpatients (N?=?425).\n Although the same personality traits (harm avoidance and self-directedness) were predominantly associated with burnout and depression, there was a much stronger association to depression than to burnout in both samples.\n Besides, we observed specific associations between personality traits and subcomponents of burnout.\n Our results underline differences in the association of burnout vs.\n depression to personality, which may mirror differences in scope.\n While symptoms of depression affect all aspects of life, burnout is supposed to be specifically related to the workplace and its requirements.\n The much stronger association of personality to depression can be important to select appropriate therapy methods and to develop a more specified treatment for burnout in comparison to depression.\n","id":"PMC4534781","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Martin

inflammatory and immune correlates.\n We investigated the interest of exploring biological parameters and sleep disturbances in relation to burnout symptoms among white-collar workers.\n Fifty-four participants with burnout were compared to 86 healthy control participants in terms of professional rank level, sleep, job strain (Karasek questionnaire), social support, anxiety and depression (HAD scale).\n Fasting concentrations of glycaemia, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), total-cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), and white blood cell (WBC) counts were assessed.\n Analysis of variance and a forward Stepwise Multiple Logistic Regression were made to identify predictive factors of burnout.\n Besides reporting more job strain (in particular job control p = 0.02), higher levels of anxiety (p&lt;0.001), and sleep disorders related to insomnia (OR = 21.5, 95%CI = 8.852.3), participants with burnout presented higher levels of HbA1C, glycaemia, CRP, lower levels of 25(OH)D, higher number of leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes (P&lt;0.001 for all) and higher total-cholesterol (P = 0.01).\n In particular, when HbA1c is &gt; 3.5%, the prevalence of burnout increases from 16.6% to 60.0% (OR = 4.3, 95%CI = 2.86.9).\n Strong significant positive correlation existed between HbA1C and the two dimensions (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization (r = 0.79 and r = 0.71, p&lt;0.01)) of burnout.\n Models including job strain, job satisfaction, anxiety and insomnia did not predict burnout (p = 0.30 and p = 0.50).\n However, when HbA1C levels is included, the prediction of burnout became significant (P = 0.03).\n Our findings demonstrated the interest of sleep and biological parameters, in particular HbA1C levels, in the characterization of professional

LILACS and Web of Science databases were searched without language or date restrictions.\n The Transparent Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed.\n Prospective studies that analyzed burnout as the exposure condition were included.\n Among the 993 articles initially identified, 61 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and 36 were analyzed because they met three criteria that must be followed in prospective studies.\n Burnout was a significant predictor of the following physical consequences: hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hospitalization due to cardiovascular disorder, musculoskeletal pain, changes in pain experiences, prolonged fatigue, headaches, gastrointestinal issues, respiratory problems, severe injuries and mortality below the age of 45 years.\n The psychological effects were insomnia, depressive symptoms, use of psychotropic and antidepressant medications, hospitalization for mental disorders and psychological ill-health symptoms.\n Job dissatisfaction, absenteeism, new disability pension, job demands, job resources and presenteeism were identified as professional outcomes.\n Conflicting findings were observed.\n In conclusion, several prospective and high-quality studies showed physical, psychological and occupational consequences of job burnout.\n The individual and social impacts

controlled intervention of workplace-based group cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia","abstract":"Purpose\nSleep disturbance is common in the working population, often associated with work stress, health complaints and impaired work performance.\n\n This study evaluated a group intervention at work, based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia, and the moderating effects of burnout scores at baseline.\n\n\nMethods\nThis is a randomized controlled intervention with a waiting list control group.\n\n Participants were employees working at least 75% of full time, reporting self-perceived regular sleep problems.\n\n Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention and at a 3-month follow-up through diaries, wrist-actigraphy and questionnaires including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the ShiromMelamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ).\n\n Fifty-one participants (63% women) completed data collections.\n\n\nResults\nA multilevel mixed model showed no significant differences between groups for sleep over time, while there was a significant effect on insomnia symptoms when excluding participants working shifts (N?=?11) from the analysis (p?=?0.044).\n\n Moreover, a moderating effect of baseline-levels of burnout scores was observed on insomnia symptoms (p?=?0.009).\n\n A post-hoc analysis showed that individuals in the intervention group with low burnout scores at baseline (SMBQ?&lt;?3.75) displayed significantly reduced ISI scores at follow-up, compared to individuals with high burnout scores at baseline (p?=?0.005).\n\n\nConclusions\nGroup CBT for insomnia given at the workplace did not reduce sleep problems looking at the group as a whole, while it was indicated that the intervention reduced insomnia in employees with regular daytime work.\n\n The results also suggest that workplace-based group CBT may improve sleep in employees with primary insomnia if not concomitant with high burnout scores.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00420-018-1291-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

burn-out of new nursing staff, (2) to verify the partial mediating role of anxiety in the relationship between workplace incivility and job burn-out, (3) to examine the resilience moderating the relations between workplace incivility and job burn-out.\n\n\nDesign\nA cross-sectional online survey was conducted in May 2016 in China.\n\n\nSetting\nThe survey was conducted in 54 cities across 29 provinces of China.\n\n\nParticipants\nA total of 903 participants were invited.\n\n Ultimately, 696 new nurses (&lt;3?service years) completed valid questionnaires.\n\n The effective response rate was 77.1%.\n\n Entry criteria: voluntary participation, having less than three service years and being a registered nurse.\n\n Exclusion criteria: being an irregular nurse, having more than three service years and refusing to participate in this work.\n\n\nOutcome measures\nAn anonymous questionnaire was distributed among new nurses.\n\n The relationships and mechanism among the variables were explored using descriptive statistical analysis, Pearsons correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression analysis.\n\n\nResults\nThe findings showed that workplace incivility was positively correlated with anxiety (r=0.371, p&lt;0.01) and job burn-out (r=0.238, p&lt;0.01) of new nurses.\n\n The positive relation between anxiety (?=0.364, p&lt;0.01) and job burn-out (?=0.240, p&lt;0.01) was also significant.\n\n Moreover, anxiety partially mediated (z=7.807, p&lt;0.01) and resilience moderated (?=?0.564, p&lt;0.01) the association between workplace incivility and job burn-out.\n\n\nConclusion\nExperience of workplace incivility by new nurses would likely generate anxiety in the victims.\n\n Further, the increased anxiety state could elevate their level of job burn-out.\n\n New nurses with high levels of resilience could buffer the negative influence of workplace incivility by using a positive coping style.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5892738","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shue","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengzhe","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinghui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhinan","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinpeng","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lihua","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1590/s1413-24782018230048","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Burnout

Physicians","abstract":"Background\nWhether burnout is a distinct phenomenon rather than a type of depression and whether it is a syndrome, limited to three core components (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and low personal accomplishment) are subjects of current debate.\n\n We investigated the depression-burnout overlap, and the pertinence of these three components in a large, representative sample of physicians.\n\n\nMethods\nIn a cross-sectional study, all Austrian physicians were invited to answer a questionnaire that included the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), the Hamburg Burnout Inventory (HBI), as well as demographic and job-related parameters.\n\n Of the 40093 physicians who received an invitation, a total of 6351 (15.8%) participated.\n\n The data of 5897 participants were suitable for analysis.\n\n\nResults\nOf the participants, 10.3% were affected by major depression.\n\n Our study results suggest that potentially 50.7% of the participants were affected by symptoms of burnout.\n\n Compared to physicians unaffected by burnout, the odds ratio of suffering from major depression was 2.99 (95% CI 2.214.06) for physicians with mild, 10.14 (95% CI 7.5813.59) for physicians with moderate, 46.84 (95% CI 35.2562.24) for physicians with severe burnout and 92.78 (95% CI 62.96136.74) for the 3% of participants with the highest HBI_sum (sum score of all ten HBI components).\n\n The HBI components Emotional Exhaustion, Personal Accomplishment and Detachment (representing depersonalization) tend to correlate more highly with the main symptoms of major depression (sadness, lack of interest and lack of energy) than with each other.\n\n A combination of the HBI components Emotional Exhaustion, Helplessness, Inner Void and Tedium (adj.\n\nR2 = 0.92) explained more HBI_sum variance than the three core components (adj.\n\nR2 = 0.85) of burnout combined.\n\n Cronbachs alpha for Emotional Exhaustion, Helplessness, Inner Void and Tedium combined was 0.90 compared to ? = 0.54 for the combination of the three core components.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates the overlap of burnout and major depression in terms of symptoms and the deficiency of the three-dimensional concept of burnout.\n\n In our opinion, it might be preferable to use multidimensional burnout inventories in combination with valid depression scales than to rely exclusively on MBI when clinically assessing burnout.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4773131","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Walter","surname":"Wurm","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Katrin","surname":"Vogel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Holl","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christoph","surname":"Ebner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dietmar","surname":"Bayer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sabrina","surname":"Mörkl","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Istvan-Szilard","surname":"Szilagyi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Erich","surname":"Hotter","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hans-Peter","surname":"Kapfhammer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Hofmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jacobus","surname":"van

disorders: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Objective\nThe objective was to conduct an update of a previously published review and meta-analysis on the association between work-related psychosocial risk factors and stress-related mental disorders (SRD).\n\n\nDesign\nSystematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n\nData sources\nMedline, Embase and PsycINFO were searched for articles published between 2008 and 12 August 2019 and references of a systematic review performed for the period before 2008 were included.\n\n Primary prospective studies were included when outcome data were described in terms of SRD assessment or a dichotomous outcome, based on a validated questionnaire, and at least two levels of work-related exposure were reported (exposed vs less or non-exposed).\n\n We used GRADE to assess the evidence for the associations between risk factors and the onset of SRD.\n\n\nResults\nSeventeen studies met the inclusion criteria.\n\n In total, a population of 73 874 workers from Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands and Sweden were included in the meta-analysis of 14 prospective cohort studies.\n\n This meta-analysis revealed moderate evidence for associations between SRD and effort reward imbalance (OR=1.9, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.15), high job demands (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.72), organisational justice (ORs=1.6 to 1.7, CIs 1.44 to 1.86), social support (ORs=1.3 to 1.4, CIs 1.16 to 1.69), high emotional demands (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.84) and decision authority (OR=1.3, CI 1.20 to 1.49).\n\n No significant or inconsistent associations were found for job insecurity, decision latitude, skill discretion and bullying.\n\n\nConclusion\nModerate evidence was found that work-related psychosocial risk factors are associated with a higher risk of SRD.\n\n Effort-reward imbalance, low organisational justice and high job demands exhibited the largest increased risk of SRD, varying from 60% to 90%.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7337889","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Henk F","surname":"van der

ODs.\n Methods: From a Dutch dynamic prospective cohort of occupational physicians (OPs), ODs assessed by OPs were retrieved for lower and higher SEP groups.\n Results: Among the lower SEP, musculoskeletal disorders, and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) comprised two-thirds of the OD diagnoses.\n Among the higher SEP, stress/burnout comprised 60% of the OD diagnoses.\n Temporary and permanent incapacity for work due to work-related lower back disorders and repetitive strain injuries differed significantly between workers in lower compared to higher SEP.\n Conclusions: Occupational diseases occur at a 2.7 higher incidence rate for workers in lower SEP compared with higher SEP.\n Incapacity for work varies between the type of OD and the level of

overall quality of research evidence in systematic reviews about prognosis due to the nature of the primary studies.\n\n Standards aimed at improving the quality of primary studies on the prognosis of health conditions have been created, but these standards are often not adequately followed causing confusion about how to judge the evidence.\n\n\nMethods\nThis article presents a proposed adaptation of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), which was developed to rate the quality of evidence in intervention research, to judge the quality of prognostic

that can increase it (moderate or large effect size, exposure-response gradient).\n\n\nConclusions\nWe describe criteria for evaluating the potential impact of each of these factors on the quality of

indicators of mental health were studied, excluding caseness at entry (for depression, anxiety, somatisation, chronic fatigue and psychotropic drug consumption respectively).\n\n Taking into account the longitudinal design, four categories of job stress are defined: 1) employees free from stress at both measures, 2) job stress present at first measure but not at the second one, 3) recent onset of

ability, even leading to early retirement.\n\n Several studies report associations between psychosocial working conditions and CMD.\n\n However, there is a lack of longitudinal research within a broad framework of psychosocial working conditions and improvement in CMD.\n\n The aim of this study was to examine the associations between several psychosocial working conditions and deteriorating and improving CMD among ageing employees over a five-to-six-year follow-up period.\n\n\nMethods\nThe study is based on the Helsinki Health Study baseline survey in 20012002 and a follow-up in 2007 (N?=?4340, response rate 83%) conducted among 40-60-year-old female and male employees.\n\n The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to measure common mental disorders.\n\n Psychosocial working conditions were measured in terms of job strain, organisational justice, work-family interface, social support and workplace bullying.\n\n The covariates included sociodemographic and health factors.\n\n\nResults\nFollowing adjustment for all the covariates, family-to-work (OR 1.41, 95% Cl 1.04-1.91) and work-to-family conflicts (OR 1.99, 95% Cl 1.42-2.78) and workplace bullying (OR 1.40,

Systematic Reviews","abstract":"Occupational burnout is a common syndrome among physicians, and several individual-directed and organization-directed interventions have been implemented to reduce it.\n Until now, several review studies have tried to identify and introduce the most appropriate interventions.\n The aim of this article was to systematically review systematic review studies of interventions for physician burnout to evaluate and summarize their results, and ultimately guide researchers to select appropriate interventions.\n A search was conducted to find review studies and systematic reviews in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Medline, Google Scholar, PubMed, and PsycINFO.\n Two reviewers independently selected and evaluated the studies based on inclusion criteria.\n Four of seven obtained review studies and systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria.\n These studies have reviewed individual-directed and organization-directed interventions intended to reduce burnout among medical students, interns, physicians, residents, and fellows.\n Various studies of the effectiveness of individual- and organization-directed interventions have obtained different results.\n This research has shown that reaching conclusions about effective interventions (individual- or organization-directed) for physician burnout is not easy and that a number of mediating or moderating variables probably influence the effectiveness of these interventions.\n Therefore, it is necessary to understand approaches and interventions for the prevention or reduction of physician burnout to fill the gaps in research.\n In addition, review studies are required to be more precise in choosing their criteria to find more accurate results.\n","id":"PMC6151971","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Simin

Live map of covid-19 evidence on 11 May and included 59 studies.\n Six reported on implementing interventions, but none reported on effects of the interventions.\n HCWs reported low interest in professional help, and greater reliance on social support and contact.\n Exposure to covid-19 was the most commonly reported correlate of mental health problems, followed by female gender, and worry about infection or about infecting others.\n Social support correlated with less mental health problems.\n HCWs reported anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and distress during the covid-19 pandemic.\n We assessed the certainty of the estimates of prevalence of these symptoms as very low using GRADE.\n Most studies did not report comparative data on mental health symptoms before the pandemic or in the general population.\n There seems to be a mismatch between risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes among HCWs in the current pandemic, their needs and preferences, and the

crisis in China: a qualitative study","abstract":"Background\nIn the early stages of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei, China, the local health-care system was overwhelmed.\n\n Physicians and nurses who had no infectious disease expertise were recruited to provide care to patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge, no studies on their experiences of combating COVID-19 have been published.\n\n We aimed to describe the experiences of these health-care providers in the early stages of the outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a qualitative study using an empirical phenomenological approach.\n\n Nurses and physicians were recruited from five COVID-19-designated hospitals in Hubei province using purposive and snowball sampling.\n\n They participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews by telephone from Feb 10 to Feb 15, 2020. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Haase's adaptation of Colaizzi's phenomenological method.\n\n\nFindings\nWe recruited nine nurses and four physicians.\n\n Three theme categories emerged from data analysis.\n\n The first was being fully responsible for patients' wellbeingthis is my duty.\n\n Health-care providers volunteered and tried their best to provide care for patients.\n\n Nurses had a crucial role in providing intensive care and assisting with activities of daily living.\n\n The second category was challenges of working on COVID-19 wards.\n\n Health-care providers were challenged by working in a totally new context, exhaustion due to heavy workloads and protective gear, the fear of becoming infected and infecting others, feeling powerless to handle patients' conditions, and managing relationships in this stressful situation.\n\n The third category was resilience amid challenges.\n\n Health-care providers identified many sources of social support and used self-management strategies to cope with the situation.\n\n They also achieved transcendence from this unique experience.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe intensive work drained health-care providers physically and emotionally.\n\n Health-care providers showed their resilience and the spirit of professional dedication to overcome difficulties.\n\n Comprehensive support should be provided to safeguard the wellbeing of health-care providers.\n\n Regular and intensive training for all health-care providers is necessary to promote preparedness and efficacy in crisis management.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China, Project of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education in

maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks.\n If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 34 days, departing from the exponential trend.\n However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.\n","id":"PMC7102589","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Andrea","surname":"Remuzzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Remuzzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmj.m1324","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Protect our healthcare workers","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmj.j4008","date":"2017-08-04","title":"AMSTAR 2: a critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews that include randomised or non-randomised studies of healthcare interventions, or both","abstract":"The number of published systematic reviews of studies of healthcare interventions has increased rapidly and these are used extensively for clinical and policy decisions.\n Systematic reviews are subject to a range of biases and increasingly include non-randomised studies of interventions.\n It is important that users can distinguish high quality reviews.\n Many instruments have been designed to evaluate different aspects of reviews, but there are few comprehensive critical appraisal instruments.\n AMSTAR was developed to evaluate systematic reviews of randomised trials.\n In this paper, we report on the updating of AMSTAR and its adaptation to enable more detailed assessment of systematic reviews that include randomised or non-randomised studies of healthcare interventions, or both.\n With moves to base more decisions on real world observational evidence we believe that AMSTAR 2 will assist decision makers in the identification of high quality systematic reviews, including those based on non-randomised studies of healthcare interventions.\n\n","id":"PMC5833365","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Beverley J","surname":"Shea","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Barnaby C","surname":"Reeves","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George","surname":"Wells","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Micere","surname":"Thuku","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Candyce","surname":"Hamel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Julian","surname":"Moran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Moher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Tugwell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vivian","surname":"Welch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elizabeth","surname":"Kristjansson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David A","surname":"Henry","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP).

self-administered anonymous questionnaire evaluating the pandemic added stress, and its negative impact on work and training quality, was e-mailed to the members of the French Association of Urologists in Training (AFUF).\n\n The association includes all French junior and senior residents.\n\n The survey lasted 3 days.\n\n Multivariable analyses using logistic regression was performed to

modifications to combat COVID-19 has been evaluated.\n A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from 10th to 17th March 2020. The well-constructed questionnaire was designed and registered at online website (Kwiksurveys) and validated.\n A total of 669 participants from 30 different countries across the world responded.\n After scrutiny, completed questionnaires (n = 650) were included in the study.\n Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. Chi-Square and Spearman correlation tests were applied to control confounders and assess the relation of dentists response with respect to gender and educational level.\n More than two-thirds of the general dental practitioners (78%) from 30 countries questioned were anxious and scared by the devastating effects of COVID-19. A large number of dentists (90%) were aware of recent changes in the treatment protocols.\n However, execution of amended treatment protocol was recorded as 61%.\n The majority of the dentists (76%) were working in the hospital setting out of which 74% were from private, and 20% were from government setups.\n Individually we received a large number of responses from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, but collectively more than 50% of the responses were from other parts of the world.\n Despite having a high standard of knowledge and practice, dental practitioners around the globe are in a state of anxiety and fear while working in their respective fields due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on humanity.\n A number of dental practices have either modified their services according to the recommended guidelines to emergency treatment only or closed down practices for an uncertain period.\n","id":"PMC7216192","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Muhammad Adeel","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rizwan","surname":"Jouhar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rizwan","surname":"Jouhar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Naseer","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Naseer","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samira","surname":"Adnan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samira","surname":"Adnan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marziya","surname":"Aftab","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Muhammad Sohail","surname":"Zafar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zohaib","surname":"Khurshid","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zohaib","surname":"Khurshid","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102157","date":"2020-04-30","title":"Working in the emergency and inpatient COVID-19 special wards: A different experience for Iranian psychiatric trainees amid the outbreak","abstract":"","id":"PMC7198408","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Behnam","surname":"Shariati","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mehrdad","surname":"Eftekhar Ardebili","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mohammadreza","surname":"Shalbafan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1055/a-1159-5575","date":"1970-01-01","title":"[Experience of practice-based psychiatrists and neurologists during the COVID-19 pandemic]","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.12659/MSM.924171","date":"2020-03-13","title":"Psychological Impact and Coping Strategies of Frontline Medical Staff in Hunan Between January and March 2020 During the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei, China","abstract":"Background\nThroughout China, during the recent epidemic in Hubei province, frontline medical staff have been responsible for tracing contacts of patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact and coping strategies of frontline medical staff in Hunan province, adjacent to Hubei province, during the COVID-19 outbreak between January and March 2020.\nMaterial/Methods\nA cross-sectional observational study included doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff throughout Hunan province between January and March 2020. The study questionnaire included five sections and 67 questions (scores, 03).\n\n The chi-squared ?2 test was used to compare the responses between professional groups, age-groups, and gender.\n\n\nResults\nStudy questionnaires were completed by 534 frontline medical staff.\n\n The responses showed that they believed they had a social and professional obligation to continue working long hours.\n\n Medical staff were anxious regarding their safety and the safety of their families and reported psychological effects from reports of mortality from COVID-19 infection.\n\n The availability of strict infection control guidelines, specialized equipment, recognition of their efforts by hospital management and the government, and reduction in reported cases of COVID-19 provided psychological benefit.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei resulted in increased stress for medical staff in adjacent Hunan province.\n\n Continued acknowledgment of the medical staff by hospital management and the government, provision of infection control guidelines, specialized equipment and facilities for the management of COVID-19 infection should be recognized as factors that

contact paediatric physicians to undertake an online Likert scale survey between 17 and 24 March.\n\n Respondents' specialty, experience and work setting were recorded.\n\n Ordinal logistic regression was used to determine respondent factors.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 542 respondents from across Australia and New Zealand: an estimated 11% of the paediatric physician workforce.\n\n A minority (36.6%) agreed that their national response had been well coordinated; the majority (92.7%) agreed that senior?level hospital administrators were taking the situation seriously.\n\n Most reported a good

pandemic, community-wide interventions, and social media use during a pandemic are unclear.\n\n The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan.\n\n Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff ?3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff ?3), respectively.\n\n A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2).\n\n Similarly, of the 214 health professionals, about one-fifth of surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (n=47, 22.0%, 95% CI 16.6-28.1) or probable depression (n=41, 19.2%, 95% CI 14.1-25.1).\n\n Around one-third of community-based adults and health professionals spent ?2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media.\n\n Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending ?2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults.\n\n Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks.\n\n Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental health.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7219721","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edson","surname":"Da

challenges to nursing staff.\n\n\nObjective\nTo explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from January 20, to February 10, 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method.\n\n\nResults\nThe psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into 4 themes.\n\n First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members.\n\n Second, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition.\n\n Third, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection.\n\n Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted.\n\n In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually.\n\n Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7141468","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Niuniu","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luoqun","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suling","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Jiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Runluo","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongwei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoguo","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanli","surname":"You","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuhua","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongyun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.7326/m20-1083","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychological

on clinicians of working to manage novel viral outbreaks, and successful measures to manage stress and psychological distress.\n\n\nDesign\nRapid review and meta-analysis.\n\n\nData sources\nCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar, searched up to late March 2020.\nEligibility criteria for study selection\nAny study that described the psychological reactions of healthcare staff working with patients in an outbreak of any emerging virus in any clinical setting, irrespective of any comparison with other clinicians or the general population.\n\n\nResults\n59 papers met the inclusion criteria: 37 were of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), eight of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), seven of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), three each of Ebola virus disease and influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and one of influenza A virus subtype H7N9. Of the 38 studies that compared psychological outcomes of healthcare workers in direct contact with affected patients, 25 contained data that could be combined in a pairwise meta-analysis comparing healthcare workers at high and low risk of exposure.\n\n Compared with lower risk controls, staff in contact with affected patients had greater levels of both acute or post-traumatic stress (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.29) and psychological distress (1.74, 1.50 to 2.03), with similar results for continuous outcomes.\n\n These findings were the same as in the other studies not included in the meta-analysis.\n\n Risk factors for psychological distress included being younger, being more junior, being the parents of dependent children, or having an infected family member.\n\n Longer quarantine, lack of practical support, and stigma also contributed.\n\n Clear communication, access to adequate personal protection, adequate rest, and both practical and psychological support were associated with reduced morbidity.\n\n\nConclusions\nEffective interventions are available to help mitigate the psychological distress experienced by staff caring for patients in an emerging disease outbreak.\n\n These interventions were similar despite the wide range of settings and types of outbreaks covered in this review, and thus could be applicable to the current covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7199468","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Steve","surname":"Kisely","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Warren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"McMahon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Dalais","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Irene","surname":"Henry","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Siskind","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.31234/osf.io/w9uxs","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Factors

SARS?CoV?2","abstract":"Background\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2) virus and resulting COVID?19 pandemic present important diagnostic challenges.\n\n Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify current infection, rule out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response.\n\n Serology tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS?CoV?2 aim to identify previous SARS?CoV?2 infection, and may help to confirm the presence of current infection.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has SARS?CoV?2 infection, or has previously had SARS?CoV?2 infection, and the accuracy of antibody tests for use in seroprevalence surveys.\n\n\nSearch methods\nWe undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID?19 Study Register and the COVID?19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv.\n\n In addition, we checked repositories of COVID?19 publications.\n\n We did not apply any language restrictions.\n\n We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 27 April 2020.\nSelection criteria\nWe included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antibody tests (including enzyme?linked immunosorbent assays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, and lateral flow assays) in people suspected of current or previous SARS?CoV?2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection.\n\n We also included studies of people either known to have, or not to have SARS?CoV?2 infection.\n\n We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS?CoV?2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests (RT?PCR) and clinical diagnostic criteria).\n\n\nData collection and analysis\nWe assessed possible bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS?2 tool.\n\n We extracted 2x2 contingency table data and present sensitivity and specificity for each antibody (or combination of antibodies) using paired forest plots.\n\n We pooled data using random?effects logistic regression where appropriate, stratifying by time since post?symptom onset.\n\n We tabulated available data by test manufacturer.\n\n We have presented uncertainty in estimates of sensitivity and specificity using 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\n\n\nMain results\nWe included 57 publications reporting on a total of 54 study cohorts with 15,976 samples, of which 8526 were from cases of SARS?CoV?2 infection.\n\n Studies were conducted in Asia (n = 38), Europe (n = 15), and the USA and China (n = 1).\n\n We identified data from 25 commercial tests and numerous in?house assays, a small fraction of the 279 antibody assays listed by the Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics.\n\n More than half (n = 28) of the studies included were only available as preprints.\n\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nThe sensitivity of antibody tests is too low in the first week since symptom onset to have a primary role for the diagnosis of COVID?19, but they may still have a role complementing other testing in individuals presenting later, when RT?PCR tests are negative, or are not done.\n\n Antibody tests are likely to have a useful role for detecting previous SARS?CoV?2 infection if used 15 or more days after the onset of symptoms.\n\n However, the duration of antibody rises is currently unknown, and we found very little data beyond 35 days post?symptom onset.\n\n We are therefore uncertain about the utility of these tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management purposes.\n\n Concerns about high risk of bias and applicability make it likely that the accuracy of tests when used in clinical care will be lower than reported in the included studies.\n\n Sensitivity has mainly been evaluated in hospitalised patients, so it is unclear whether the tests are able to detect lower antibody levels likely seen with milder and asymptomatic COVID?19 disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7387103","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan

its context is a paramount example for such claims.\n\n In this article, we describe why expressing the certainty in evidence to support a decision is critical and why the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach matters now, perhaps more than ever and no matter what the specific topic is in relation to COVID-19. We finally also offer suggestions for how it can be used appropriately to support decision-making at global, national, and local level when emergency, urgent or rapid responses are needed.\n\n\nStudy Design and Setting\nThis is an invited commentary to address the objectives above building on examples from the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n This includes an iterative discussion of examples and development of guidance.\n\n\nResults\nThe GRADE approach is a transparent and structured method for assessing the certainty of evidence and when developing recommendations that requires little additional time.\n\n We describe why emergency, urgent, or rapid responses do not justify omitting this critical assessment of the evidence.\n\n In situations of emergencies and urgencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, GRADE can similarly be used to express and convey certainty in intervention effects, test accuracy, risk and prognostic factors, consequences of public health measures, and qualitative bodies of evidence.\n\n\nConclusions\nAssessing and communicating the certainty of evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic is critical.\n\n Those offering evidence synthesis or making recommendations should use transparent ratings of the body of evidence supporting a claim regardless of time that is available or needed to provide this response.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7274969","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Holger J.","surname":"Schünemann","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Santesso","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gunn E.","surname":"Vist","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carlos","surname":"Cuello","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tamara","surname":"Lotfi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Signe","surname":"Flottorp","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marina","surname":"Davoli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Reem","surname":"Mustafa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joerg J.","surname":"Meerpohl","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pablo","surname":"Alonso-Coello","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elie A.","surname":"Akl","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s12245-020-00299-5","date":"2020-07-06","title":"Physical and mental health impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare workers: a scoping review","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread to 198 countries, with approximately 2.4 million confirmed cases and 150,000 deaths globally as of April 18.

of healthcare professionals: a rapid review","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Epidemics or pandemics, such as the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, pose unique challenges to healthcare professionals (HCPs).\n\n Caring for patients during an epidemic/pandemic may impact negatively on the mental health of HCPs.\n\n There is a lack of evidence-based advice on what would be effective in mitigating this impact.\n\n Objectives: This rapid review synthesizes the evidence on the psychological impact of pandemics/epidemics on the mental health of HCPs, what factors predict this impact, and the evidence of prevention/intervention strategies to reduce this impact.\n\n\nMethod\nid='Par2'>According to rapid review guidelines, systematic searches were carried out in Embase.\n\ncom, PubMed, APA PsycINFO-Ovid SP, and Web of Science (core collection).\n\n Searches were restricted to the years 2003 or later to ensure inclusion of the most recent epidemic/pandemics, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n\n Papers written in French or English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and of quantitative design using validated measures of mental health outcomes were included.\n\n Of 1308 papers found, 50 were included.\n\n The full protocol for this rapid review was registered with Prospero (reg.\n\nno.\n\n CRD42020175985).\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Results show that exposed HCPs working with patients during an epidemic/pandemic are at heightened risk of mental health problems in the short and longer term, particularly: psychological distress, insomnia, alcohol/drug misuse, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, burnout, anger, and higher perceived stress.\n\n These mental health problems are predicted by organizational, social, personal, and psychological factors and may interfere with the quality of patient care.\n\n Few evidence-based early interventions exist so far.\n\n\nDiscussion\nid='Par4'>HCPs need to be provided with psychosocial support to protect their mental wellbeing if they are to continue to provide high quality patient care.\n\n Several recommendations relevant during and after an epidemic/pandemic, such as COVID-19, and in preparation for a future outbreak, are proposed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7422454","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Suzannah","surname":"Stuijfzand","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Camille","surname":"Deforges","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vania","surname":"Sandoz","email":"vania.sandoz@bluewin.ch","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Consuela-Thais","surname":"Sajin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cecile","surname":"Jaques","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jolanda","surname":"Elmers","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Antje","surname":"Horsch","email":"Antje.Horsch@chuv.ch","contributions":"0"}],"References

There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required.\n Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience.\n New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure.\n This Position Paper provides a strategy that may be both adapted for, and integrated with, research efforts in other countries.\n","id":"PMC7159850","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emily A","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rory C","surname":"O'Connor","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"V Hugh","surname":"Perry","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Irene","surname":"Tracey","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Wessely","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Louise","surname":"Arseneault","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Clive","surname":"Ballard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Helen","surname":"Christensen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roxane","surname":"Cohen Silver","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ian","surname":"Everall","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tamsin","surname":"Ford","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ann","surname":"John","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Kabir","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kate","surname":"King","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ira","surname":"Madan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Michie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrew K","surname":"Przybylski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roz","surname":"Shafran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Angela","surname":"Sweeney","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carol M","surname":"Worthman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lucy","surname":"Yardley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Katherine","surname":"Cowan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claire","surname":"Cope","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Hotopf","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ed","surname":"Bullmore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102052","date":"2020-03-26","title":"Chinese mental health burden during the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic significantly affects mental health of Chinese people.\n","id":"PMC7195325","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yeen","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Zhao","email":"743159984@qq.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112954","date":"2020-03-26","title":"Generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and sleep quality during COVID-19 outbreak in China: a web-based cross-sectional survey","abstract":"\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak significantly affects the mental health of Chinese public","id":"PMC7152913","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yeen","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Zhao","email":"zhaoning2018@email.szu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.031","date":"2020-04-12","title":"The differential psychological distress of populations affected by the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"","id":"PMC7156946","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huipeng","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haiping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shining","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qifeng","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tingyun","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Baoguo","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/ijerph17072381","date":"2020-03-28","title":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Quality of Life among Local Residents in Liaoning Province, China: A Cross-Sectional Study","abstract":"Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and quality of life among local Chinese residents aged ?18 years in Liaoning Province, mainland China.\n An online survey was distributed through a social media platform between January and February 2020.

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·031·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·6112·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater

questionnaire packet which consisted of the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ).\n\n A total of 79 doctors and 86 nurses participated in the survey.\n\n Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between SAS, SDS, and SCSQ score.\n\n A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively.\n\n History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression.\n\n The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively.\n\n History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses.\n\n The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender

Wuhan.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional, anonymized, self-reported questionnaire survey was conducted at the Childrens Healthcare Centre of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.\n\n The questionnaire consisted of three parts, including socio-demographic characteristics and COVID-19 epidemic-related factors, the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and Zungs self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS).\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 47 out of 123 (38%) participants with PSQI scores &gt; 7 were identified as having sleep disturbance.\n\n A logistic

measures, to the extent that the Italian government has imposed a quarantine on the entire country.\n Quarantine has a huge impact and can cause considerable psychological strain.\n The present study aims to establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress in the general population.\n An online survey was administered from 1822 March 2020 to 2766 participants.\n Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to examine the associations between sociodemographic variables; personality traits; depression, anxiety, and stress.\n Female gender, negative affect, and detachment were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress.\n Having an acquaintance infected was associated with increased levels of both depression and stress, whereas a history of stressful situations and medical problems was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety.\n Finally, those with a family member infected and young person who had to work outside their domicile presented higher levels of anxiety and stress, respectively.\n This epidemiological picture is an important benchmark for identifying persons at greater risk of suffering from psychological distress and the results are useful for tailoring psychological interventions targeting the post-traumatic nature of the distress.\n","id":"PMC7246819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cristina","surname":"Mazza","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eleonora","surname":"Ricci","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eleonora","surname":"Ricci","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Silvia","surname":"Biondi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marco","surname":"Colasanti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefano","surname":"Ferracuti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Napoli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Napoli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Roma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Roma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.009","date":"2020-05-08","title":"Prevalence

emerged in China in late 2019, most citizens were home-quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n This study explored the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in a sample of home-quarantined college students to identify the psychological distress risk factors.\n\n\nMethod\nThe PTSD and depressive symptoms in the 2485 participants from 6 universities were investigated using online survey versions of the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version and the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9), and data on sleep durations, exposure, home-quarantine time and socio-demographic variables were also collected.\n\n\nResults\nThe PTSD and depression prevalence were found to be 2.7% and 9.0%.\n\n Subjectively, feeling extreme fear was the most significant risk factor for psychological distress, followed by short sleep durations, being in their graduating year (4th year) and living in severely afflicted areas.\n\n Sleep durations was a mediator between exposures and mental health problems.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results suggested that the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 could be serious.\n\n Psychological interventions that reduce fear and improve sleep durations need to be made available to the home-quarantined university students, and graduating students and those in the worst-hit areas should be given priority

challenges to nursing staff.\n\n\nObjective\nTo explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from January 20, to February 10, 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method.\n\n\nResults\nThe psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into 4 themes.\n\n First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members.\n\n Second, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition.\n\n Third, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection.\n\n Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted.\n\n In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually.\n\n Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7141468","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Niuniu","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luoqun","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suling","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Jiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Runluo","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongwei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoguo","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanli","surname":"You","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuhua","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongyun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1080/14767058.2020.1763949","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychological

weeks later, and to investigate factors of mental health among youth groups.\n A cross-sectional study was conducted two weeks after the occurrence of COVID-19 in China.\n A total of 584 youth enrolled in this study and completed the question about cognitive status of COVID-19, the General Health Questionnaire(GHQ-12), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Negative coping

nearly 40.4% the sampled youth were found to be prone to psychological problems and 14.4% the sampled youth with Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.\n Univariate logistic regression revealed that youth mental health was significantly related to being less educated (OR?=?8.71, 95%CI:1.9738.43), being the enterprise employee (OR?=?2.36, 95%CI:1.095.09), suffering from the PTSD

pandemic, community-wide interventions, and social media use during a pandemic are unclear.\n\n The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan.\n\n Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff ?3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff ?3), respectively.\n\n A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2).\n\n Similarly, of the 214 health professionals, about one-fifth of surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (n=47, 22.0%, 95% CI 16.6-28.1) or probable depression (n=41, 19.2%, 95% CI 14.1-25.1).\n\n Around one-third of community-based adults and health professionals spent ?2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media.\n\n Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending ?2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults.\n\n Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks.\n\n Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental

Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point.\n\n The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms.\n\n Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups.\n\n\nResults\nPregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.\n\n02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration.\n\n These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.\n\n005).\n\n The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.\n\n003), suspected infections (P=.\n\n004), and deaths per day (P=.\n\n001).\n\n Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak.\n\n\nConclusion\nMajor life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm.\n\n Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7211756","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yanting","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Han","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chenchi","surname":"Duan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cheng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianxia","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hualin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiangjuan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeping","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiufeng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yiping","surname":"You","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongmei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuangqi","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoling","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yajuan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haihong","surname":"Lao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Wen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junying","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuhua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Diyun","surname":"Meng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jingli","surname":"Zhai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Youchun","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qinwen","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiuping","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xifeng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cindy-Lee","surname":"Dennis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"He-feng","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/da.22077","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk

families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9%, 22.4%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7%, 11.9%).\n\n Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS.\n\n People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than in the unaffected group during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb.\n\n 2020. The government should focus more on providing economic and medical support to improve the general populations mental state.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7199435","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoming","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuai","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinrong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/jnnp-2020-323134","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychological

among health professional students during the COVID-19 outbreak","abstract":"Background\nDue to the drastic surge of COVID-19 patients, many countries are considering or already graduating health professional students early to aid professional resources.\n\n We aimed to assess outbreak-related psychological distress and symptoms of acute stress reaction (ASR) in health professional students and to characterize individuals with potential need for interventions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a prospective cohort study of 1442 health professional students at Sichuan University, China.\n\n At baseline (October 2019), participants were assessed for childhood adversity, stressful life events, internet addiction, and family functioning.\n\n Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined associations of the above exposures with subsequent psychological distress and ASR in response to the outbreak.\n\n\nResults\nThree hundred and eighty-four (26.63%) participants demonstrated clinically significant psychological distress, while 160 (11.10%) met the criterion for a probable ASR.\n\n Individuals who scored high on both childhood adversity and stressful life event experiences during the past year were at increased risks of both distress (ORs 2.002.66) and probable ASR (ORs 2.233.10), respectively.\n\n Moreover, internet addiction was associated with elevated risks of distress (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.602.64) and probable ASR (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.503.10).\n\n By contrast, good family functioning was associated with decreased risks of distress (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.330.55) and probable ASR (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.330.69).\n\n All associations were independent of baseline psychological distress.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that COVID-19 related psychological distress and high symptoms burden of ASR are common among health professional students.\n\n Extended family and professional support should be considered for vulnerable individuals during these unprecedented times.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7225209","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yuchen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yue","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jingwen","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Unnur

disease (AD), is one of the most burdensome medical conditions.\n\n Usually, the reviews that aim at calculating the prevalence of dementia include estimates from studies without assessing their methodological quality.\n\n Alzheimers Disease International (ADI) proposed a score to assess the methodological quality of population-based studies aimed at estimating the prevalence of dementia.\n\n During the last three years, the European Commission has funded three projects (Eurodem, EuroCoDe, and ALCOVE) in order to estimate the prevalence of dementia in Europe.\n\n\nObjective:\nThe aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of data on the prevalence of dementia in Europe derived from studies that included only subjects with a diagnosis of dementia according to the DSM IV criteria, and that had a high quality score according to ADI criteria.\n\n\nMethods:\nWe considered the studies selected by the two projects EuroCoDe (19932007) and Alcove (20082011), and we performed a new bibliographic search.\n\n For the systematic review, we only selected the subset of articles that included subjects with a diagnosis of dementia according to the DSM IV criteria.\n\n The studies were qualitatively assessed using the ADI tool.\n\n\nResults:\nThe meta-analysis considered 9 studies that were carried out in Europe

problems, but also caused great psychological distress, especially for medical staff.\n\n We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n\nMethod\nMedical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers.\n\n The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms.\n\n We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms.\n\n\nResult\nThere were a total of 1,563 participants in our study.\n\n Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score ? 8).\n\n A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.07.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.20.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.02.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = 1.63.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.33.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.38.5).\n\n\nConclusion\nOur study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor.\n\n Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various

Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (Sars-CoV-2) and COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) have caused an emergency status in the health system, including in the dentistry environment.\n Italy registered the third highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world and the second highest in Europe.\n An anonymous online survey composed of 40 questions has been sent to dentists practicing in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia, one of the areas in Italy most affected by COVID-19. The survey was aimed at highlighting the practical and emotional consequences of COVID-19 emergence on daily clinical practice.\n Specifically, it assessed dentists behavioral responses, emotions and concerns following the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic restrictive measures introduced by the Italian national administrative order of 10 March 2020 (DM-10M20), as well as the dentists perception of infection likelihood for themselves and patients.\n Furthermore, the psychological impact of COVID-19 was assessed by means of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 test (GAD-7), that measures the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms.\n Using local dental associations (ANDI-Associazione Nazionale Dentisti Italiani, CAO-Commissione Albo Odontoiatri) lists, the survey was sent by email to all dentists in the district of Modena and Reggio Emilia (874 practitioners) and was completed by 356 of them (40%).\n All dental practitioners closed or reduced their activity to urgent procedures, 38.2% prior to and 61.8% after the DM-10M20. All reported a routinely use of the most common protective personal equipment (PPE), but also admitted that the use of PPE had to be modified during COVID-19 pandemic.\n A high percentage of patients canceled their previous appointments after the DM-10M20. Almost 85% of the dentists reported being worried of contracting the infection during clinical activity.\n The results of the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) evaluation showed that 9% of respondents reported a severe anxiety.\n To conclude, the COVID-19 emergency is having a highly negative impact on the activity of dentists practicing in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia.\n All respondents reported practice closure or strong activity reduction.\n The perception of this negative impact was accompanied by feelings of concern (70.2%), anxiety (46.4%) and fear (42.4%).\n The majority of them (89.6%) reported concerns about their professional future and the hope for economic measures to help dental practitioners.\n","id":"PMC7277877","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ugo","surname":"Consolo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierantonio","surname":"Bellini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierantonio","surname":"Bellini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Davide","surname":"Bencivenni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Davide","surname":"Bencivenni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cristina","surname":"Iani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vittorio","surname":"Checchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmj.327.7414.557","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Measuring

set standards in the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\n\n Our aim was to evaluate the impact of PRISMA endorsement on the quality of reporting and methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published in journals in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology (GH).\n\n\nMethods\nQuality of reporting and methodological quality were evaluated by assessing the adherence of papers to PRISMA checklist and AMSTAR quality scale.\n\n After identifying the GH journals which endorsed PRISMA in instructions for authors (IA), we appraised: 15 papers published in 2012 explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group A); 15 papers from the same journals published in 2012 not explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group B); 30 papers published the year preceding PRISMA endorsement from the same journals as above (Group C); 30 papers published in 2012 on the 10 highest impact factor journals in GH which not endorsed PRISMA (Group D).\n\n\nResults\nPRISMA statement was referred in the IA in 9 out of 70 GH journals (12.9%).\n\n We found significant increase in overall adherence to PRISMA checklist (Group A, 90.1%; Group C, 83.1%; p?=?0.003) and compliance to AMSTAR scale (Group A, 85.0%; Group C, 74.6%; p?=?0.002), following the PRISMA endorsement from the nine GH journals.\n\n Explicit referencing of PRISMA in manuscript was not associated with increase in quality of reporting and methodological quality (Group A vs.\n\n B, p?=?0.651, p?=?0.900, respectively).\n\n Adherence to PRISMA checklist, and the compliance with AMSTAR were significantly higher in journals endorsing PRISMA compared to those not (Groups A+B vs.\n\n D; p?=?0.003 and p?=?0.016, respectively).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe endorsement of PRISMA resulted in increase of both quality of reporting and methodological quality.\n\n It is advised that an increasing number of medical journals include PRISMA in the instructions for

and meta-analyses published in nursing journals: a cross-sectional study","abstract":"Objective\nSystematic reviews (SRs) often poorly report key information, thereby diminishing their usefulness.\n\n Previous studies evaluated published SRs and determined that they failed to meet explicit criteria or characteristics.\n\n The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was recommended as a reporting guideline for SR and meta-analysis (MA), but previous studies showed that adherence to the statement was not high for SRs published in different medical fields.\n\n Thus, the aims of this study are twofold: (1) to investigate the number of nursing journals that have required or recommended the use of the PRISMA statement for reporting SR, and (2) to examine the adherence of SRs and/or meta-analyses to the PRISMA statement published in nursing journals.\n\n\nDesign\nA cross-sectional study.\n\n\nMethods\nNursing journals listed in the ISI journal citation report were divided into 2 groups based on the recommendation of PRISMA statement in their Instruction for Authors.\n\n SRs and meta-analyses published in 2014 were searched in 3 databases.\n\n 37 SRs and meta-analyses were randomly selected in each group.\n\n The adherence of each item to the PRISMA was examined and summarised using descriptive statistics.\n\n The quality of the SRs was assessed by Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews.\n\n The differences between the 2 groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.\n\n\nResults\nOut of 107 nursing journals, 30 (28.0%) recommended or required authors to follow the PRISMA statement when they submit SRs or meta-analyses.\n\n The median rates of adherence to the PRISMA statement for reviews published in journals with and without PRISMA endorsement were 64.9% (IQR: 17.692.3%) and 73.0% (IQR: 59.594.6%), respectively.\n\n No significant difference was observed in any of the items between the 2 groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe median adherence of SRs and meta-analyses in nursing journals to PRISMA is low at 64.9% and 73.0%, respectively.\n\n Nonetheless, the adherence level of nursing journals to the PRISMA statement does not significantly vary whether they endorse or recommend such a guideline.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5306529","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wilson W S","surname":"Tam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kenneth K

QUOROM to PRISMA: A Survey of High-Impact Medical Journals' Instructions to Authors and a Review of Systematic Reviews in Anesthesia Literature","abstract":"Background\nThe PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement was published to help authors improve how they report systematic reviews.\n\n It is unknown how many journals mention PRISMA in their instructions to authors, or whether stronger journal language regarding use of PRISMA improves author compliance.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nAn Internet-based investigation examined the extent to which 146 leading medical journals have incorporated the PRISMA Statement into their instructions to authors.\n\n Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n\n Also, systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals and the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses) Statement were used to explore the hypothesis that indicating compliance with the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript is associated with improved compliance with the reporting guideline.\n\n In a sample of 146 journals publishing systematic reviews, the PRISMA Statement was referred to in the instructions to authors for 27% (40/146) of journals; more often in general and internal medicine journals (7/14; 50%) than in specialty medicine journals (33/132; 25%).\n\n In the second part of the study, 13 systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals in 2008 were included for appraisal.\n\n Mention of the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript was associated with higher compliance with the QUOROM checklist (P?=?0.022).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nMost of the leading medical journals used ambiguous language regarding what was expected of authors.\n\n Further improvement on quality of reporting of systematic reviews may entail journals clearly informing authors of their requirements.\n\n Stronger directions, such as requiring an indication of adherence to a research quality of reporting statement in the manuscript, may improve reporting and utility of systematic reviews.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3217994","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kun-ming","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-qian","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qing-hui","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Moher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-quan","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei-feng","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert

program implemented to perform meta-analyses of proportions in Stata.\n\n It builds further on the existing Stata procedure metan which is typically used to pool effects (risk ratios, odds ratios, differences of risks or means) but which is also used to pool proportions.\n\n Metaprop implements procedures which are specific to binomial data and allows computation of exact binomial and score test-based confidence intervals.\n\n It provides appropriate methods for dealing with proportions close to or at the margins where the normal approximation procedures often break down, by use of the binomial distribution to model the within-study variability or by allowing Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation to stabilize the variances.\n\n Metaprop was applied on two published meta-analyses: 1) prevalence of HPV-infection in women with a Pap smear showing ASC-US; 2) cure rate after treatment for cervical precancer using cold coagulation.\n\n\nResults\nThe first meta-analysis showed a pooled HPV-prevalence of 43% (95% CI: 38%-48%).\n\n In the second meta-analysis, the pooled percentage of cured women was 94% (95% CI: 86%-97%).\n\n\nConclusion\nBy using

testing in the management of women with equivocal cervical cytological abnormalities, but not in case of low-grade lesions.\n We performed a meta-analysis including studies where the high-risk probe of the Hybrid Capture-II is used to triage these two cytological categories.\n The triage test-positivity rate reflects the colposcopy referral workload.\nData were pooled on the HPV test positivity rate in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS/ASC-US) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), derived from different cytological classification systems.\n The meta-analysis was restricted to studies, published between 1991 and 2007. A random-effect model was applied for meta-analytical pooling and the influence of covariates on the HPV positivity rate was analyzed by meta-regression.\n The variation by age was assessed within individual studies since age strata were not defined uniformly.\n On an average, 43% (95% CI: 4046%) of women with ASCUS/ASC-US were high-risk HPV positive (range 2374%).\n In women with LSIL, the pooled positivity rate was 76% (95% CI: 7181%; range 5589%).\n In spite of considerable inter-study heterogeneity, the difference in HPV positivity between the two triage groups was large and highly significant: 32% (95% CI: 2738%).\n HPV rates dropped tremendously as age and cutoffs of test positivity increased.\n Other factors (cytological classification system, country, continent, collection method and year of publication) had no statistically significant impact, except in LSIL triage where HPV positivity was significantly lower in European compared to American studies.\n Women with LSIL, especially younger women, have high HPV positivity rates suggesting limited utility of reflex HPV triaging these cases.\n Research is needed to identify more specific methods to triage women with low-grade squamous cervical lesions.\n","id":"PMC3822872","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Arbyn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Martin-Hirsch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frank","surname":"Buntinx","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Van

meta-regression of diagnostic test accuracy data  a tutorial","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Although statistical procedures for pooling of several epidemiological metrics are generally available in statistical packages, those for meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies including options for multivariate regression are lacking.\n\n Fitting regression models and the processing of the estimates often entails lengthy and tedious calculations.\n\n Therefore, packaging appropriate statistical procedures in a robust and user-friendly program is of great interest to the scientific community.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>metadta is a statistical program for pooling of diagnostic accuracy test data in Stata.\n\n It implements both the bivariate random-effects and the fixed-effects model, allows for meta-regression, and presents the results in tables, a forest plot and/or summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) plot.\n\n For a model without covariates, it quantifies the unexplained heterogeneity due to between-study variation using an I2 statistic that accounts for the mean-variance relationship and the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.\n\n To demonstrate metadta, we applied the program on two published meta-analyses on: 1) the sensitivity and specificity of cytology and other markers including telomerase for primary diagnosis of bladder cancer, and 2) the accuracy of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing on self-collected versus clinician-collected samples to detect cervical precancer.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Without requiring a continuity correction, the pooled sensitivity and specificity generated by metadta of telomerase for the diagnosis of primary bladder cancer was 0.77 [95% CI, 0.70, 0.82] and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.75, 0.97] respectively.\n\n Metadta also allowed to assess the relative accuracy of HPV testing on self- versus clinician-taken specimens using data from comparative studies conducted in different clinical settings.\n\n The analysis showed that HPV testing with target-amplification assays on self-samples was as sensitive as on clinician-samples in detecting cervical pre-cancer irrespective of the clinical setting.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>The metadta program implements state of art statistical procedures in an attempt to close the gap between methodological statisticians and systematic reviewers.\n\n We expect the program to popularize the use of appropriate statistical methods for diagnostic meta-analysis further.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8962039","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Victoria

pandemic impact on mental health: a web-based cross-sectional survey on a sample of Italian general practitioners","abstract":"Background:\nSince the World Health Organization declared the new 2019 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak first a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and then a pandemic, Italy held more than 195.350 cases and 26.380 deaths.\n\n Working in the frontline with suspected Covid-19 infection patients, general practitioners (GPs) are daily under both physical and psychological pressure.\n\n\nMethods:\nA web-based cross-sectional survey was carried out on italian GPs working in Genoa (Italy), to assess the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on mental health.\n\n The survey was anonymous and a free Google Forms® software was used.\n\n\nResults:\nOne hundred thirty-one GPs completed the survey.\n\n Compared to GPs with absent or mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 &lt; 10), GPs reporting moderate to severe depressive symptoms (N=30, 22.9%; PHQ-9 ? 10) reported more helplessness (96.7% vs.\n\n 79.2%, p=.\n\n025), spent more than three hours searching for COVID-19 information (43.3% vs.\n\n 19.8%, p=.\n\n024), perceived less adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (6.7% vs.\n\n 23.8%, p=.\n\n049) and visited more COVID-19 infected patients (16.63 ± 27.30 vs.\n\n 9.52 ± 11.75, p=.\n\n041).\n\n Moreover, PHQ-9 ? 10 GPs reported a significant higher severity for both anxiety and insomnia (13.43 ± 4.96 vs.\n\n 4.88 ± 3.53 and 11.60 ± 5.53 vs.\n\n 4.84 ± 3.81, respectively; p&lt;.\n\n001), and a worse quality of life in both mental (34.60 ± 7.45 vs.\n\n 46.01 ± 7.83, p&lt;.\n\n001) and physical (43.50 ± 9.37 vs.\n\n 52.94 ± 4.78, p&lt;.\n\n001) component summary.\n\n\nConclusions:\nOur results give early insight into the urgent need to provide continuity of care for patients at the community-level, adequate PPE to GPs and a clear guidance from public health institutions.\n\n A precarious healthcare system both at a

Buddies: Rapid Deployment of a Psychological Resilience Intervention for Health Care Workers During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","abstract":"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its rapid global spread have created unprecedented challenges to health care systems.\n Significant and sustained efforts have focused on mobilization of personal protective equipment, intensive care beds, and medical equipment, while substantially less attention has focused on preserving the psychological health of the medical workforce tasked with addressing the challenges of the pandemic.\n And yet, similar to battlefield conditions, health care workers are being confronted with ongoing uncertainty about resources, capacities, and risks; as well as exposure to suffering, death, and threats to their own safety.\n These conditions are engendering high levels of fear and anxiety in the shortterm, and place individuals at risk for persistent stressexposure syndromes, subclinical mental health symptoms, and professional burnout in the longterm.\n Given the potentially wide-ranging mental health impact of COVID-19, protecting health care workers from adverse psychological effects of the pandemic is critical.\n Therefore, we present an overview of the potential psychological stress responses to the COVID-19 crisis in medical providers and describe preemptive resilience-promoting strategies at the organizational and personal level.\n We then describe a rapidly deployable Psychological Resilience Intervention founded on a peersupport model (Battle Buddies) developed by the United States Army.\n This interventionthe product of a multidisciplinary collaboration between the Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral Sciences at the University of Minnesota Medical Centeralso incorporates evidence-informed stress inoculation methods developed for managing psychological stress exposure in providers deployed to disasters.\n Our multilevel, resource-efficient, and scalable approach places 2 key tools directly in the hands of providers: (1) apeersupport Battle Buddy; and (2) adesignated mental health consultant who can facilitate training in stress inoculation methods, provide additional support, or coordinate referral for external professional consultation.\n In parallel, we have instituted a voluntary research data-collection component that will enable us to evaluate the interventions effectiveness while also identifying the most salient resilience factors for future iterations.\n It is our hope that these elements will provide guidance to other organizations seeking to protect the well-being of their medical workforce during the pandemic.\n Given the remarkable adaptability of human beings, we believe that, by promoting resilience, our diverse health care workforce can emerge from this monumental challenge with new skills, closer relationships, and greater confidence in the power of community.\n","id":"PMC7199769","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cristina

more vulnerable to complications of infection because of age and comorbid conditions.\n\n\nDesign:\nCross-sectional survey linked to 3 active clinical trials and 1 cohort study.\n\n\nSetting:\n5 academic internal medicine practices and 2 federally qualified health centers.\n\n\nPatients:\n630 adults aged 23 to 88 years living with 1 or more chronic

coronavirus.\n\n Nearly a third could not correctly identify symptoms (28.3%) or ways to prevent infection (30.2%).\n\n One in 4 adults (24.6%) believed that they were not at all likely to get the

outbreak.\n\n In multivariable analyses, participants who were black, were living below the poverty level, and had low health literacy were more likely to be less worried about COVID-19, to not believe that they would become infected, and to feel less prepared for an outbreak.\n\n Those with low health literacy had greater confidence in the federal government

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

COVID-19 Response: Survey of Health Care and Other Workers","abstract":"Background\nThe response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created an unprecedented disruption in work conditions.\n\n This study describes the mental health and well-being of workers both with and without clinical exposure to patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and describe work-related and personal factors associated with their mental health and well-being.\n\n\nMethods\nAll faculty, staff, and postdoctoral fellows of a university, including its medical school, were invited in April 2020 to complete an online questionnaire measuring stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being.\n\n We examined associations between these outcomes and factors including work in high-risk clinical settings and family/home stressors.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%).\n\n Overall, 34% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 61% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home.\n\n Among all workers, anxiety (prevalence ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.73), depression (prevalence ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59), and high work exhaustion (prevalence ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.36) were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19. Poor family-supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes (prevalence ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.21-1.62; prevalence ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.48-1.92; and prevalence ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.44-1.64, respectively).\n\n Age &lt;40 years and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with these poorer outcomes.\n\n Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and working in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on the mental health and well-being of both clinical and nonclinical employees.\n\n Mitigating exposure to COVID-19 and increasing supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being for all workers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7470175","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anne","surname":"Moorhead","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Albert","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Albert","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bojana","surname":"Knezevic","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bradley

and burnout","abstract":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put considerable physical and emotional strain on frontline healthcare workers.\n Among frontline healthcare workers, physician trainees represent a unique groupfunctioning simultaneously as both learners and caregivers and experiencing considerable challenges during the pandemic.\n However, we have a limited understanding regarding the emotional effects and vulnerability experienced by trainees during the pandemic.\n We investigated the effects of trainee exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 on their depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment.\n All physician trainees at an academic medical center (n = 1375) were invited to participate in an online survey.\n We compared the measures of depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment among trainees who were exposed to patients being tested for COVID-19 and those that were not, using univariable and multivariable models.\n We also evaluated perceived life stressors such as childcare, home schooling, personal finances and work-family balance among both groups.\n 393 trainees completed the survey (29% response rate).\n Compared to the non-exposed group, the exposed group had a higher prevalence of stress (29.4% vs.\n 18.9%), and burnout (46.3% vs.\n 33.7%).\n The exposed group also experienced moderate to extremely high perceived stress regarding childcare and had a lower work-family balance.\n Multivariable models indicated that trainees who were exposed to COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher stress (10.96 [95% CI, 9.65 to 12.46] vs 8.44 [95% CI, 7.3 to 9.76]; P = 0.043) and were more likely to be burned out (1.31 [95% CI, 1.21 to1.41] vs 1.07 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.19]; P = 0.002].\n We also found that female trainees were more likely to be stressed (P = 0.043); while unmarried trainees were more likely to be depressed (P = 0.009), and marginally more likely to have anxiety (P = 0.051).\n To address these challenges, wellness programs should focus on sustaining current programs, develop new and targeted mental health resources that are widely accessible and devise strategies for creating awareness regarding these resources.\n","id":"PMC7410237","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas

medical errors, and previously validated measures including the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), a one-item burnout measure, the World Health Organizations abbreviated quality of life assessment (WHOQOL-BREF), and PROMIS short-form depression, anxiety, and sleep-related impairment scales.\n\n Between 2 and 3 weeks later, 227 (91%) repeated the PFI and the sleep-related impairment scale.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Principal components analysis justified PFI subscales for professional fulfillment, work exhaustion, and interpersonal disengagement.\n\n Test-retest reliability

burnout measures correlated highly (r ? 0.50) with their closest related MBI equivalents.\n\n Cohens d effect size differences in self-reported medical errors for high versus low burnout classified

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":" Updates on the novel coronavirus outbreak up to March 2, 2020.

masks.\n HCWs whose family/peers greatly encouraged face mask use had lower prevalence of depression.\n Access to adequate supplies of personal protective equipment is essential for the psychological health of HCWs working in stressful environments, through potentially easing their perceptions of vulnerability to

a systematic review and meta-analysis compliant with PRISMA guidance.\n Databases and grey literature were searched to April 2013, and records were screened against protocol eligibility criteria.\n Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken using a piloted form.\n Random-effects meta-analyses estimated (i) pooled proportion of HCWs willing to work and (ii) pooled odds ratios of risk factors associated with willingness to work.\n Heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test.\n Data were synthesized narratively where meta-analyses were not possible.\n Forty-three studies met our inclusion criteria.\n Meta-analysis of the proportion of HCWs willing to work was abandoned due to excessive heterogeneity (I2 = 99·2%).\n Narrative synthesis showed study estimates ranged from 23·1% to 95·8% willingness to work, depending on context.\n Meta-analyses of specific factors showed that male HCWs, physicians and nurses, full-time employment, perceived personal safety, awareness of pandemic risk and clinical knowledge of influenza pandemics, role-specific knowledge, pandemic response training, and confidence in personal skills were statistically significantly associated with increased willingness.\n Childcare obligations were significantly associated with decreased willingness.\n HCWs' willingness to work during an influenza pandemic was moderately high, albeit highly variable.\n Numerous risk factors showed a statistically significant association with willingness to work

to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience, anticipation of the pandemic may have impact on behaviors related to influenza vaccination (IV) and relevant public health behaviors such as wearing a face mask when having influenza-like-illnesses (ILI), which would play an important role in the control of human avian influenza outbreaks.\n\n This paper investigated the prevalence and factors related to IV uptake and use of face mask in public venues when having ILI symptoms.\n\n\n\nMethods:\n\nAn anonymous cross-sectional population-based random telephone survey of 302 Hong Kong Chinese adults aged 1860, using a structured questionnaire, was conducted in November 2005.\n\nResults:\n\nIn the last 3 months, 17.9% of the respondents received IV; 36.6% of those presenting ILI symptoms often used face mask in public venues.\n\n Anticipation of a bird-to-human H5N1 outbreak, perceptions that such an outbreak would be worse than SARS, that IV was efficacious in preventing bird-to-human avian influenza transmission were associated with the studied IV behavior (OR=2.643.97, p &lt; 0.05).\n\n Exposure to live birds, perceived similar symptoms between influenza and bird-to-human H5N1 avian influenza, that bird-to-human avian influenza was more lethal than SARS were predictive use of face mask when having ILI symptoms (OR = 4.258.34, p &lt; 0.05).\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe prevalence of IV and use of face mask in the study population may be increasing, which may be related to concerns of avian influenza.\n\n Perceptions related to human avian influenza were associated with IV and mask use behaviors.\n\n This can potentially be turned into opportunities of promoting desirable public health behaviors.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7099207","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"J.

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 2024 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt;

China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19

rate and mortality has created an unprecedented state of emergency worldwide.\n\n This global situation may have a negative impact on the psychological well?being of individuals which in turn impacts individuals' performance.\n\n This study aims to explore the prevalence of depression and anxiety among the GP, HCPs, and USs during COVID?19 outbreak, and to identify key population(s) who might need psychological intervention.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross?sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22 and 28 March 2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during the COVID?19 outbreak.\n\n The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ?9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder?7 (GAD?7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants.\n\n Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 23.8% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\n Anxiety was most prevalent across university students 21.5%, followed by healthcare professionals 11.3%, and general population 8.8%.\n\n Females among healthcare professionals and university students, divorced healthcare professionals, pulmonologists, and university students with history of chronic disease were at higher risk of developing depression.\n\n Females, divorced participants among the general population, and university students with history of chronic disease and those with high income (?1,500 JD) were at higher risk of developing anxiety.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring outbreaks, individuals are put under extreme stressful condition resulting in higher risk of developing anxiety and depression particularly for students and healthcare professionals.\n\n Policymakers and mental healthcare providers are advised to provide further mental support to these vulnerable groups during this pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7361060","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Abdallah

The present study examined the association between subjective well-being (SWB) and psychopathology and investigated the etiology of this association in a large population-based cohort study of adolescent twins (n = 9,136) and their non-twin siblings (n = 1,474) aged 1220 years.\n Phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations between SWB and psychopathology were obtained from multivariate genetic modeling conditional on sex.\n An SWB factor score was used based on measures of subjective happiness, satisfaction with life, and quality of life.\n Psychopathology was obtained from all syndrome and broad-band scales of the Dutch version of the ASEBA Youth Self Report.\n Males reported significantly higher levels of SWB than females.\n Females reported significantly more internalizing problems while males report significantly higher levels of externalizing behavior.\n In both sexes, significant negative associations were found between SWB and psychopathology, with the strongest associations seen for SWB and the YSR syndrome scale anxious/depression behavior.\n The observed associations were primarily explained by genetic correlations while non-shared environmental influences were mainly domain specific.\n The genetic liability to lower levels of SWB are indicative of a genetic liability to higher levels of psychopathology, suggesting that it might be feasible to screen for emotional and behavioral problems before clear signs are present by screening on indices of subjective well-being.\n","id":"PMC3897864","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Meike","surname":"Bartels","email":"m.bartels@vu.nl","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John

may affect their academic performance.\n\n We aimed to characterize the university students attended by psychiatrists at the students mental health service (SAPPE) and to compare their academic performance with that of non-patient students.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING:\n Cross-sectional study based on review of medical files and survey of academic data at a Brazilian public university.\n\n \nMETHODS:\n Files of 1,237 students attended by psychiatrists at SAPPE from 2004 to 2011 were reviewed.\n\n Their academic performance coefficient (APC) and status as of July 2015 were compared to those of a control group of 2,579 non-patient students matched by gender, course and year of enrolment.\n\n \nRESULTS:\n 37% of the patients had had psychiatric treatment and 4.5% had made suicide attempts before being attended at SAPPE.\n\n Depression (39.1%) and anxiety disorders/phobias (33.2%) were the most frequent diagnoses.\n\n Severe mental disorders such as psychotic disorders (3.7%) and bipolar disorder (1.9%) were less frequent.\n\n Compared with non-patients, the mean APC among the undergraduate patients was slightly lower (0.63; standard deviation, SD: 0.26; versus 0.64; SD: 0.28; P = 0.025), but their course completion rates were higher and course abandonment rates were lower.\n\n Regarding postgraduate students, patients and non-patients had similar completion rates, but patients had greater incidence of discharge for poor performance and lower dropout rates.\n\n \nCONCLUSION:\n Despite the inclusion of socially vulnerable people with severe mental disorders, the group of patients had similar academic performance, and in some aspects better, than, that of non-patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9969722","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cláudia Ribeiro

Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

in cancer patients and in the general population","abstract":"Background\nThe Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9 is a widely used instrument to screen for depression in clinical research.\n\n The first aim of this study was to psychometrically test the PHQ-9 in a large sample of cancer patients.\n\n The second aim was to calculate unbiased estimates of the depression burden for several cancer groups taking into account age and gender distributions.\n\n\nMethods\nA sample of 2,059 cancer patients with varying diagnoses were examined in this study six months after discharge from a rehabilitation clinic.\n\n A representative sample of 2,693 people from the general population served as controls.\n\n Expected PHQ-9 mean scores of the general population sample, regressed on age and gender, were calculated to enable a fair comparison of different groups of cancer patients.\n\n\nResults\nWhile the reliability (Cronbachs alpha) for the PHQ-9 scale was good (alpha???0.84), the CFA fit indices of the one-dimensional solution were unsatisfactory in the patients sample.\n\n The factorial analysis confirmed two factors.\n\n PHQ-9 mean scores for 15 types of cancer are given, ranging from 4.0 (prostate) to 8.2 (thyroid gland).\n\n Differences between expected mean scores (derived from the general population) and raw mean scores of the cancer subsamples are reported that provide a better estimate of the depression burden.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results confirmed that the PHQ-9 performs well in testing depression in cancer patients.\n\n Regression coefficients can be used for performing unbiased comparisons among cancer groups, not only for this study.\n\n The burden of patients with testis cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma is underestimated when age and gender are not taken into account.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4736493","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Hinz","email":"Andreas.Hinz@medizin.uni-leipzig.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anja","surname":"Mehnert","email":"Anja.Mehnert@medizin.uni-leipzig.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rüya-Daniela","surname":"Kocalevent","email":"R.Kocalevent@uke.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elmar","surname":"Brähler","email":"Elmar.Braehler@medizin.uni-leipzig.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Forkmann","email":"tforkmann@ukaachen.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susanne","surname":"Singer","email":"singers@uni-mainz.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Schulte","email":"tschulte@badoexen.de","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.19.20025395","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Generalized

Citations, PsycINFO, and Web of Science (January 2000-February 2015).\n\n\nInclusion criteria\nEligible studies compared PHQ-9 scores with major depression diagnoses from validated diagnostic interviews.\n\n Primary study data and study level data extracted from primary reports were synthesized.\n\n For PHQ-9 cut-off scores 5-15, bivariate random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity, separately, among studies that used semistructured diagnostic interviews, which are designed for administration by clinicians; fully structured interviews, which are designed for lay administration; and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric (MINI) diagnostic interviews, a brief fully structured interview.\n\n Sensitivity and specificity were examined among participant subgroups and, separately, using meta-regression, considering all subgroup variables in a single model.\n\n\nResults\nData were obtained for 58 of 72 eligible studies (total n=17?357; major depression cases n=2312).\n\n Combined sensitivity and specificity was maximized at a cut-off score of 10 or above among studies using a semistructured interview (29 studies, 6725 participants; sensitivity 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.92; specificity 0.85, 0.82 to 0.88).\n\n Across cut-off scores 5-15, sensitivity with semistructured interviews was 5-22% higher than for fully structured interviews (MINI excluded; 14 studies, 7680 participants) and 2-15% higher than for the MINI (15 studies, 2952 participants).\n\n Specificity was similar across diagnostic interviews.\n\n The PHQ-9 seems to be similarly sensitive but may be less specific for younger patients than for older patients; a cut-off score of 10 or above can be used regardless of age.\n\n.\n\n\nConclusions\nPHQ-9 sensitivity compared with semistructured diagnostic interviews was greater than in previous conventional meta-analyses that combined reference standards.\n\n A

Due to male gender characteristics and existing public image, nursing is often not considered as a career choice by men.\n\n Whether nursing would benefit from increased number of men is a key question in the literature.\n\n The purpose of this integrative review of the literature was to identify factors influencing men to enter the nursing profession.\n\n In addition, it sought to understand the challenges they are confronted within this profession.\n\n\nEvidence Acquisition:\nA systematic search of the existing literature was performed using an Internet search with broad keywords to access related articles in both Persian and English databases.\n\n Finally, 34 studies (written between 2000 and early 2013) were selected and surveyed.\n\n\nResults:\nMost of the studies were conducted in developed counties.\n\n The review identified reasons why males choose nursing, and other challenges facing men entering and working in nursing.\n\n Themes that emerged from the literature include educational and societal barriers experienced by men in nursing, recruitment, career choice, and role strain.\n\n\nConclusions:\nRegarding mens influences on professional development, and also the importance of gender-based caring, policies for recruitment and retention of men in nursing must be followed hastily.\n\n However, there is a need for further research

China","abstract":"Background\nHealthcare workers fighting against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are under tremendous pressure, which puts them at an increased risk of developing psychological problems.\n\n\nAims\nThis study aimed to investigate the prevalence of psychological problems in different healthcare workers (ie, physicians, medical residents, nurses, technicians and public health professionals) during the COVID-19 pandemic in China and explore factors that are associated with the onset of psychological problems in this population during this public health crisis.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted in February 2020 among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Psychological problems were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire and Insomnia Severity Index.\n\n Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the factors that were associated with psychological problems.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia and the overall psychological problems in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China was 46.04%, 44.37%, 28.75% and 56.59%, respectively.\n\n The prevalence of the overall psychological problems in physicians, medical residents, nurses, technicians and public health professionals was 60.35%, 50.82%, 62.02%, 57.54% and 62.40%, respectively.\n\n Compared with healthcare workers who did not participate in front-line work, front-line healthcare workers had a higher risk of anxiety, insomnia and overall psychological problems.\n\n In addition, attention to negative or neutral information about the pandemic, receiving negative feedback from families and friends who joined front-line work, and unwillingness to join front-line work if given a free choice were three major factors for these psychological problems.\n\n\nConclusions\nPsychological problems are pervasive among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Receiving negative information and participating in front-line work appear to be important risk factors for psychological problems.\n\n The psychological health of different healthcare workers should be protected during the COVID-19 pandemic with timely interventions and proper information feedback.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7299004","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jianyu","surname":"Que","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Le","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Le","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiahui","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiajia","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suying","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yimiao","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weizhen","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kai","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yankun","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maosheng","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Bao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Collaboration

study","abstract":"The goal of this research is to test whether often observed correlates of loneliness in older age are related to onset of loneliness longitudinally.\n Despite the increasing number of longitudinal studies, the investigation of factors that are related to onset of loneliness is still limited.\n Analyses are based on data of the TamELSA study, which is a population-based prospective study in Tampere, Finland and started in 1979. For the present study 469 older adults aged between 60 and 86 years at baseline, who were not lonely at baseline, were selected and followed-up in 1989, 1999 and 2006. During the 28 years of follow-up approximately one third (N = 178) of the study population developed feelings of loneliness.\n Logistic regression analyses indicated that losing a partner, reduced social activities, increased physical disabilities, increased feelings of low mood, uselessness and nervousness, rather than baseline characteristics, are related to enhanced feelings of loneliness at follow-up.\n The higher incidence of loneliness among women can be fully explained by the unequal distribution of risk factors among men and women (e.\ng.\n, women more often become widowed).\n Our results are in line with the cognitive approach that conceptualizes loneliness as an unpleasant feeling due to a perceived discrepancy between the desired and the achieved level of social and personal resources.\n","id":"PMC3047676","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marja","surname":"Aartsen","email":"m.j.aartsen@vu.nl","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marja","surname":"Jylhä","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.apnu.2008.11.002","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Predictors

undergoing hemodialysis and university hospital workers who treated patients Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) during its outbreak.\n\n\nDesign\nThe group of subjects consisted of 1800 hospital practitioners and 73 quarantined patients undergoing hemodialysis.\n\n The Impact of Events ScaleRevised (IES-R) was administered to the practitioners twice, once during the hospital shutdown and again one month after the shutdown.\n\n The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered to patients undergoing hemodialysis.\n\n\nResults\nDuring the initial stages of the MERS outbreak, healthcare workers who performed MERS-related tasks scored significantly higher on the total IES-R and its subscales.\n\n In the second assessment of the high-risk group, the sleep and numbness subscale scores from the IES-R differed depending on the implementation of home quarantine, and the intrusion subscale scores differed depending on the performance of MERS-related tasks.\n\n\nConclusion\nMedical staff that performed MERS-related tasks showed the highest risk for post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms even after time had elapsed.\n\n The risk increased even after home quarantine.\n\n Prompt and continuous psychiatric intervention is needed in high mortality infectious disease

psychological adaptation of the nurses in a structured SARS caring unit during outbreak: A prospective and periodic assessment study in Taiwan","abstract":"To assess the rapidly changing psychological status of nurses during the acute phase of the 2003 SARS outbreak, we conducted a prospective and periodic evaluation of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation among nurses in SARS units and non-SARS units.\n Nurse participants were from two SARS units (regular SARS [N = 44] and SARS ICU [N = 26]) and two non-SARS units (Neurology [N = 15] and CCU [N = 17]).\n Participants periodically self-evaluated their depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, sleep disturbance, attitude towards SARS and family support.\n Results showed that depression (38.5% vs.\n 3.1%) and insomnia (37% vs.\n 9.7%) were, respectively, greater in the SARS unit nurses than the non-SARS unit nurses.\n No difference between these two groups was found in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (33% vs.\n 18.7%), yet, three unit subjects (SARS ICU, SARS regular and Neurology) had significantly higher rate than those in CCU (29.7% vs.\n 11.8%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05).\n For the SARS unit nurses, significant reduction in mood ratings, insomnia rate and perceived negative feelings as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of SARS at the end of the study (all p &lt; 0.001) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred.\n The adjustment of nurses in the more structured SARS ICU environment, where nurses care for even more severely ill patients, may have been as good or better than that of nurses in the regular SARS unit.\n Occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was linked to direct exposure to SARS patient care, previous mood disorder history, younger age and perceived negative feelings.\n Positive coping attitude and strong social and family support may have protected against acute stress.\n In conclusion, the psychological impact on the caring staffs facing future bio-disaster will be minimized with lowered risk factors and a safer and more structured work environment.\n","id":"PMC7094424","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tung-Ping","surname":"Su","email":"tpsu@vghtpe.gov.tw","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Te-Cheng","surname":"Lien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chih-Yi","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yiet

Syndrome","abstract":"OBJECTIVES\nIsolation due to the management of infectious diseases is thought to affect mental health, but the effects are still unknown.\n\n We examined the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and anger in persons isolated during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic both at isolation period and at four to six months after release from isolation.\n\n We also determined risk factors associated with these symptoms at four to six months.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOf 14,992 individuals isolated for 2-week due to having contact with MERS patients in 2015, when MERS was introduced to Korea, 1,692 individuals were included in this study.\n\n Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and anger was assessed with the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory at four to six months after release from isolation for MERS.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 1,692 who came in contact with MERS patients, 1,656 were not diagnosed with MERS.\n\n Among 1,656, anxiety symptoms showed 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3 to 8.9%) and feelings of anger were present in 16.6% (95% CI, 14.8 to 18.4%) during the isolation period.\n\n At four to six months after release from isolation, anxiety symptoms were observed in 3.0% (95%CI, 2.2 to 3.9%).\n\n Feelings of anger were present in 6.4% (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.6%).\n\n Risk factors for experiencing anxiety symptoms and anger at four to six months after release included symptoms related to MERS during isolation, inadequate supplies (food, clothes, accommodation), social networking activities (email, text, Internet), history of psychiatric illnesses, and financial loss.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMental health problems at four to six month after release from isolation might be prevented by providing mental health support to individuals with vulnerable mental health, and providing accurate information as well as appropriate supplies, including food, clothes, and accommodation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5177805","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hyunsuk","surname":"Jeong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hyeon

post-outbreak levels of depressive symptoms and the relationship between those depressive symptom levels and the types of outbreak event exposures experienced.\n\n\nMethods\nIn 2006, randomly selected employees (N = 549) of a hospital in Beijing were surveyed concerning their exposures to the city's 2003 SARS outbreak and the ways in which the outbreak had affected their mental health.\n\n Subjects were assessed on sociodemographic factors, on types of exposure to the outbreak, and on symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression.\n\n\nResults\nThe results of multinomial regression analyses showed that, with other relevant factors controlled for, being single, having been quarantined during the outbreak, having been exposed to other traumatic events before SARS, and perceived SARS-related risk level during the outbreak were found to increase the odds of having a high level of depressive symptoms 3 years later.\n\n Altruistic acceptance of risk during the outbreak was found to decrease the odds of high post-outbreak depressive symptom levels.\n\n\nConclusions\nPolicy makers and mental health professionals working to prepare for potential disease outbreaks should be aware that the experience of being quarantined can, in some cases, lead to long-term adverse mental health

and associated psychological distress during the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic","abstract":"Background\nHealth care workers (HCWs) presented frequent concerns regarding their health and their families' health and high levels of psychological distress during previous disease outbreaks, such as the SARS outbreak, which was associated with social isolation and intentional absenteeism.\n\n We aimed to assess HCWs concerns and anxiety, perceived sufficiency of information, and intended behavior during the recent A/H1N1 influenza pandemic and their associations with psychological distress.\n\n\nMethod\nBetween September 1st and 30th, 2009, 469 health-care workers (HCWs) of a tertiary teaching hospital completed a 20-item questionnaire regarding concerns and worries about the new A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, along with Cassileth's Information Styles Questionnaire (part-I) and the GHQ-28.\nResults\nMore than half of the present study's HCWs (56.7%) reported they were worried about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, their degree of anxiety being moderately high (median 6/9).\n\n The most frequent concern was infection of family and friends and the health consequences of the disease (54.9%).\n\n The perceived risk of being infected was considered moderately high (median 6/9).\n\n Few HCWs (6.6%) had restricted their social contacts and fewer (3.8%) felt isolated by their family members and friends because of their hospital work, while a low percentage (4.3%) indented to take a leave to avoid infection.\n\n However, worry and degree of worry were significantly associated with intended absenteeism (p &lt; 0.0005), restriction of social contacts (p &lt; 0.0005), and psychological distress (p = 0.036).\n\n Perceived sufficiency of information about several aspects of the A/H1N1 influenza was moderately high, and the overall information about the A/H1N1 influenza was considered clear (median 7.4/9).\n\n Also, perceived sufficiency of information for the prognosis of the infection was significantly independently associated with the degree of worry about the pandemic (p = 0.008).\n\n\nConclusions\nA significant proportion of HCWs experienced moderately high anxiety about the pandemic, and their degree of worry was an independent correlate of psychological distress.\n\n Since perceived sufficiency of information about the A/H1N1 influenza prognosis was associated with reduced degree of worry, hospital managers and consultation-liaison psychiatry services should try to provide for HCWs' need for information, in order to offer favourable working conditions in times of extreme distress, such as the current and future pandemics.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2990753","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Panagiota","surname":"Goulia","email":"panagiotagoulia@yahoo.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christos","surname":"Mantas","email":"chmantas@cc.uoi.gr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Danai","surname":"Dimitroula","email":"danaed75@otenet.gr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dimitrios","surname":"Mantis","email":"mantisdi@otenet.gr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Hyphantis","email":"tyfantis@cc.uoi.gr","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/1043659619881491","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychological

Of the 38 studies that compared psychological outcomes of healthcare workers in direct contact with affected patients, 25 contained data that could be combined in a pairwise meta-analysis comparing healthcare workers at high and low risk of exposure.\n\n Compared with lower risk controls, staff in contact with affected patients had greater levels of both acute or post-traumatic stress (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.29) and psychological distress (1.74, 1.50 to 2.03), with similar results for continuous outcomes.\n\n These findings were the same as in the other studies not included in the meta-analysis.\n\n Risk factors for psychological distress included being younger, being more junior, being the parents of dependent children, or having an infected family member.\n\n Longer quarantine, lack of practical support, and stigma also contributed.\n\n Clear communication, access to adequate personal protection, adequate rest, and both practical and psychological support were associated with reduced morbidity.\n\n\nConclusions\nEffective interventions are available to help mitigate the psychological distress experienced by staff caring for patients in an emerging disease outbreak.\n\n These interventions were similar despite the wide range of settings and types of outbreaks covered in this review, and thus could be applicable to the current covid-19

psychological stress.\n\n The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China.\n\n The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD).\n\n Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nWe received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants.\n\n 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS.\n\n 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n\n Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience.\n\n Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of

to understand the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety and depression symptoms in first-line anti-epidemic medical staff and their coping styles for these negative emotions.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gansu (China), with a questionnaire packet which consisted of the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ).\n\n A total of 79 doctors and 86 nurses participated in the survey.\n\n Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between SAS, SDS, and SCSQ score.\n\n A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively.\n\n History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression.\n\n The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively.\n\n History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses.\n\n The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the total score of positive coping was negatively correlated with the total score of anxiety (r=-0.182, p=0.002) and depression (r=-0.253, p=0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe first-line anti-epidemic medical staff have high anxiety and depression symptoms and adopting positive coping

(Sars-CoV-2) and COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) have caused an emergency status in the health system, including in the dentistry environment.\n Italy registered the third highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world and the second highest in Europe.\n An anonymous online survey composed of 40 questions has been sent to dentists practicing in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia, one of the areas in Italy most affected by COVID-19. The survey was aimed at highlighting the practical and emotional consequences of COVID-19 emergence on daily clinical practice.\n Specifically, it assessed dentists behavioral responses, emotions and concerns following the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic restrictive measures introduced by the Italian national administrative order of 10 March 2020 (DM-10M20), as well as the dentists perception of infection likelihood for themselves and patients.\n Furthermore, the psychological impact of COVID-19 was assessed by means of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 test (GAD-7), that measures the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms.\n Using local dental associations (ANDI-Associazione Nazionale Dentisti Italiani, CAO-Commissione Albo Odontoiatri) lists, the survey was sent by email to all dentists in the district of Modena and Reggio Emilia (874 practitioners) and was completed by 356 of them (40%).\n All dental practitioners closed or reduced their activity to urgent procedures, 38.2% prior to and 61.8% after the DM-10M20.

Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 6271% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.\n Other biocidal agents such as 0.050.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.\n As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.\n","id":"PMC7132493","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"G.","surname":"Kampf","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"D.","surname":"Todt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Pfaender","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"E.","surname":"Steinmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/archinte.166.10.1092","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

anxiety and fear of getting infected among dentists while working during the current novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) outbreak.\n In addition, dentists knowledge about various practice modifications to combat COVID-19 has been evaluated.\n A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from 10th to 17th March 2020. The well-constructed questionnaire was designed and registered at online website (Kwiksurveys) and validated.\n A total of 669 participants from 30 different countries across the world responded.\n After scrutiny, completed questionnaires (n = 650) were included in the study.\n Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. Chi-Square and Spearman correlation tests were applied to control confounders and assess the relation of dentists response with respect to gender and educational level.\n More than two-thirds of the general dental practitioners (78%) from 30 countries questioned were anxious and scared by the devastating effects of COVID-19. A large number of dentists (90%) were aware of recent changes in the treatment protocols.\n However, execution of amended treatment protocol was recorded as 61%.\n The majority of the dentists (76%) were working in the hospital setting out of which 74% were from private, and 20% were from government setups.\n Individually we received a large number of responses from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, but collectively more than 50% of the responses were from other parts of the world.\n Despite having a high standard of knowledge and practice, dental practitioners around the globe are in a state of anxiety and fear while working in their respective fields due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on humanity.\n A number of dental practices have either modified their services according to the recommended guidelines to emergency treatment only or closed down practices for an uncertain period.\n","id":"PMC7216192","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Muhammad Adeel","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rizwan","surname":"Jouhar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rizwan","surname":"Jouhar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Naseer","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Naseer","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samira","surname":"Adnan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samira","surname":"Adnan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marziya","surname":"Aftab","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Muhammad Sohail","surname":"Zafar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zohaib","surname":"Khurshid","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zohaib","surname":"Khurshid","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jiph.2016.06.002","date":"2016-06-24","title":"Cross-infection and infection control in dentistry: Knowledge, attitude and practice of patients attended dental clinics in King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","abstract":"The objective of the study was to determine the level of Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) of patients attended dental clinics at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH) regarding cross infections and infection control in dentistry.\n A cross-sectional study was conducted among 225 patients who attended the dental clinics of KAUH, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 2014.

research needs","abstract":"Research on respiratory protection against biologic agents is important to address major concerns such as occupational safety and terrorist attack.\n This review describes the literature on respiratory protection against bioaerosols and identifies research gaps.\n Respiratory protection is a complex field involving a number of factors, such as the efficiency of respirator filter material; face-piece fitting; and maintenance, storage, and reuse of respirators.\n Several studies used nonpathogenic microorganisms having physical characteristics similar to that of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to analyze microbial penetration through respirators.\n Some studies showed that high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and N95 filters provided a higher level of protection than dust/mist (DM) and dust/mist/fume (DMF) filters.\n Flow rate and relative humidity appear to alter the level of penetration of microorganisms through respirator filters.\n The relationship between microbial penetration through respirator filters and the aerodynamic diameter, length, or other physical characteristics of microorganisms remains controversial.\n Whether reaerosolization of bioaerosol particles should be a concern is unclear, given the fact that one study has demonstrated significant reaerosolization of 1- to 5-?m particles loaded onto respirator filters.\n Respirator maintenance, storage, and decontamination are important factors to be considered when reusing respirators.\n The respiratory protection against biologic warfare agents such as anthrax in military and civilian situations is described.\n","id":"PMC7118892","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Appavoo","surname":"Rengasamy","email":"rda5@cdc.gov","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ziqing","surname":"Zhuang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roland","surname":"BerryAnn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychological

Professionals in Wuhan, China: Cross-Sectional Survey","abstract":"Background\nThe mental health consequences of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, community-wide interventions, and social media use during a pandemic are unclear.\n\n The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan.\n\n Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff ?3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff ?3), respectively.\n\n A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2).\n\n Similarly, of the 214 health professionals, about one-fifth of surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (n=47, 22.0%, 95% CI 16.6-28.1) or probable depression (n=41, 19.2%, 95% CI 14.1-25.1).\n\n Around one-third of community-based adults and health professionals spent ?2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media.\n\n Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending ?2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults.\n\n Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks.\n\n Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental health.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7219721","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edson","surname":"Da

Sierra Leone, July 2015","abstract":"Background\nThe mental health impact of the 20142016 Ebola epidemic has been described among survivors, family members and healthcare workers, but little is known about its impact on the general population of affected countries.\n\n We assessed symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the general population in Sierra Leone after over a year of outbreak response.\n\n\nMethods\nWe administered a cross-sectional survey in July 2015 to a national sample of 3564 consenting participants selected through multistaged cluster sampling.\n\n Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-4. PTSD symptoms were measured by six items from the Impact of Events Scale-revised.\n\n Relationships among Ebola experience, perceived Ebola threat and mental health symptoms were examined through binary logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nPrevalence of any anxiety-depression symptom was 48% (95% CI 46.8% to 50.0%), and of any PTSD symptom 76% (95% CI 75.0% to 77.8%).\n\n In addition, 6% (95% CI 5.4% to 7.0%) met the clinical cut-off for anxiety-depression, 27% (95% CI 25.8% to 28.8%) met levels of clinical concern for PTSD and 16% (95% CI 14.7% to 17.1%) met levels of probable PTSD diagnosis.\n\n Factors associated with higher reporting of any symptoms in bivariate analysis included region of residence, experiences with Ebola and perceived Ebola threat.\n\n Knowing someone quarantined for Ebola was independently associated with anxiety-depression (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.3, 95%?CI 1.7 to 2.9) and PTSD (AOR 2.095% CI 1.5 to 2.8) symptoms.\n\n Perceiving Ebola as a threat was independently associated with anxiety-depression (AOR 1.69 95% CI 1.44 to 1.98) and PTSD (AOR 1.86 95% CI 1.56 to 2.21) symptoms.\n\n\nConclusion\nSymptoms of PTSD and anxiety-depression were common after one year of Ebola response; psychosocial support may be needed for people with Ebola-related experiences.\n\n Preventing, detecting, and responding to mental health conditions should be an important component of global health security efforts.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5873549","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mohamed

problems, but also caused great psychological distress, especially for medical staff.\n\n We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n\nMethod\nMedical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers.\n\n The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms.\n\n We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms.\n\n\nResult\nThere were a total of 1,563 participants in our study.\n\n Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score ? 8).\n\n A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.07.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.20.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.02.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = 1.63.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.33.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.38.5).\n\n\nConclusion\nOur study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor.\n\n Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various sociopsychological factors at play in this situation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7171048","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chenxi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuai","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simeng","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongxiang","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiting","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lijun","surname":"Kang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meilei","surname":"Su","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jihui","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongchun","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

Gardens","abstract":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) possesses characteristics that render it particularly prone to stigmatization.\n SARS-related stigma, despite its salience for public health and stigma research, has had little examination.\n This study combines survey and case study methods to examine subjective stigma among residents of Amoy Gardens (AG), the first officially recognized site of community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong.\n A total of 903 residents of AG completed a self-report questionnaire derived from two focus groups conducted toward the end of the 3-month outbreak.\n Case studies of two residents who lived in Block E, the heart of the SARS epidemic at AG, complement the survey data.\n Findings show that stigma affected most residents and took various forms of being shunned, insulted, marginalized, and rejected in the domains of work, interpersonal relationships, use of services and schooling.\n Stigma was also associated with psychosomatic distress.\n Residents strategies for diminishing stigma varied with gender, age, education, occupation, and proximity to perceived risk factors for SARS such as residential location, previous SARS infection and the presence of ex-SARS household members.\n Residents attributed stigma to government mismanagement, contagiousness of the mysterious SARS virus, and alarmist media reporting.\n Stigma clearly decreased, but never completely disappeared, after the outbreak.\n The findings confirm and add to existing knowledge on the varied origins, correlates, and impacts of stigma.\n They also highlight the synergistic roles of inconsistent health policy responses and risk miscommunication by the media in rapidly amplifying stigma toward an unfamiliar illness.\n While recognizing the intrinsically stigmatizing nature of public health measures to control SARS, we recommend that a consistent inter-sectoral approach is needed to minimize stigma and to make an effective health response to future outbreaks.\n","id":"PMC7116975","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sing","surname":"Lee","email":"singlee@cuhk.edu.hk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lydia

of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation of the nurses in a structured SARS caring unit during outbreak: A prospective and periodic assessment study in Taiwan","abstract":"To assess the rapidly changing psychological status of nurses during the acute phase of the 2003 SARS outbreak, we conducted a prospective and periodic evaluation of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation among nurses in SARS units and non-SARS units.\n Nurse participants were from two SARS units (regular SARS [N = 44] and SARS ICU [N = 26]) and two non-SARS units (Neurology [N = 15] and CCU [N = 17]).\n Participants periodically self-evaluated their depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, sleep disturbance, attitude towards SARS and family support.\n Results showed that depression (38.5% vs.\n 3.1%) and insomnia (37% vs.\n 9.7%) were, respectively, greater in the SARS unit nurses than the non-SARS unit nurses.\n No difference between these two groups was found in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (33% vs.\n 18.7%), yet, three unit subjects (SARS ICU, SARS regular and Neurology) had significantly higher rate than those in CCU (29.7% vs.\n 11.8%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05).\n For the SARS unit nurses, significant reduction in mood ratings, insomnia rate and perceived negative feelings as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of SARS at the end of the study (all p &lt; 0.001) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred.\n The adjustment of nurses in the more structured SARS ICU environment, where nurses care for even more severely ill patients, may have been as good or better than that of nurses in the regular SARS unit.\n Occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was linked to direct exposure to SARS patient care, previous mood disorder history, younger age and perceived negative feelings.\n Positive coping attitude and strong social and family support may have protected against acute stress.\n In conclusion, the psychological impact on the caring staffs facing future bio-disaster will be minimized with lowered risk factors and a safer and more structured work environment.\n","id":"PMC7094424","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tung-Ping","surname":"Su","email":"tpsu@vghtpe.gov.tw","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Te-Cheng","surname":"Lien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chih-Yi","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yiet

psychosocial variables and working conditions, and nurses coping methods and distress in response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis in Canada.\n\n\nParticipants and procedure\nThe sample consisted of 333 nurses (315 women, 18 men) who completed an Internet-mediated questionnaire that was posted on the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO) website between March and May 2004. The questionnaire was restricted to respondents who had to authenticate their RNAO membership with a valid username and password before accessing the questionnaire.\n\n This served a dual purpose: to ensure that only RNAO nurses completed the questionnaire and thereby safeguarding the generalizability of the findings; and second, to prevent any one nurse from contributing more than once to the overall sample.\n\n\nResults\nCorrelational analysis yielded several significant relationships between psychosocial variables and working conditions, and the traditional correlates of burnout and stress.\n\n Three multiple regression analysis revealed that the model we evolvedincluding higher levels of vigor, organizational support, and trust in equipment/infection control initiative; and lower levels of contact with SARS patients, and time spent in quarantinepredicted to lower levels of avoidance behavior, emotional exhaustion, and state anger.\n\n\nConclusions\nBy employing models of stress and burnout that combine psychosocial variables and working conditions, researchers can account for significant amounts of variance in outcomes related to burnout.\n\n These findings highlight the importance of vigor and perceived organizational support in predicting nurses symptoms of burnout.\n\n For healthcare administrators, this means that a likely strategy for assuaging the negative outcomes of stress should address nurses psychosocial concerns and the working conditions that they face during novel times of crisis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094220","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zdravko","surname":"Marjanovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Esther

HCWs experienced psychological distress, particularly increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS).\n\n Factors contributing to increased distress in HCWs working in high-risk areas treating patients with SARS have not been fully elucidated.\n\n The goal of this study was to quantify the psychological effects of working in a high-risk unit during the SARS outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nHCWs in a Toronto hospital who worked in high-risk areas completed a questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the SARS crisis along with the Impact of Event ScaleRevised, which screens for PTSS.\n\n The comparison group consisted of clinical units that had no contact with patients infected with SARS.\n\n\nResults\nFactors that were identified to cause distress in the 248 respondent HCWs were the following: (a) perception of risk to themselves, (b) impact of the SARS crisis on their work life, (c) depressive affect, and (d) working in a high-risk unit.\n\n In addition, HCWs who cared for only one SARS patient in comparison to those caring for multiple SARS patients experienced more PTSS.\n\n\nConclusions\nAs expected, HCWs who were working in high-risk units experienced greater distress.\n\n Contrary to expectations, HCWs who experienced greater contact with SARS patients while working in the high-risk units were less distressed.\n\n This suggests that HCW experience in treating patients infected with SARS may be a mediating factor that could be amenable to intervention in future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094601","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rima","surname":"Styra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Hawryluck","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Robinson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sonja","surname":"Kasapinovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Calvin","surname":"Fones","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wayne

insomnia has been scarce.\n\n This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of brief e-aid cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (eCBTI) in preventing transition from episodic insomnia to persistent insomnia.\n\n\nMethods and analysis\nThis is a pragmatic two-arm multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing eCBTI with treatment as usual (TAU) in outpatients.\n\n Two hundred patients with episodic insomnia (as defined by DSM-5) will be recruited.\n\n Patients will be randomly assigned to receive 1?week eCBTI via a Smartphone application, or to receive TAU.\n\n Treatment effects will be assessed at 1?week and 3 months after intervention.\n\n The primary outcome of the study, whether the eCBTI program is sufficient in preventing transition from short-term to persistent insomnia, is measured by the Insomnia Severity Index.\n\n Secondary outcome measurements include the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale, Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test, Sleep Hygiene and Practices Scale, Pre-sleep Arousal Scale and Epworth Sleepiness Scale.\n\n Additionally, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Short-Form 12-Item Health Survey will be used for

Middle Income Countries: A Systematic Review","abstract":"Background\nA wide range of screening tools are available to detect common mental disorders (CMDs), but few have been specifically developed for populations in low and middle income countries (LMIC).\n\n Cross-cultural application of a screening tool requires that its validity be assessed against a gold standard diagnostic interview.\n\n Validation studies of brief CMD screening tools have been conducted in several LMIC, but until now there has been no review of screening tools for all CMDs across all LMIC populations.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic review with broad inclusion criteria was conducted, producing a comprehensive summary of brief CMD screening tools validated for use in LMIC populations.\n\n For each validation, the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was calculated as an easily comparable measure of screening tool validity.\n\n Average DOR results weighted by sample size were calculated for each screening tool, enabling us to make broad recommendations about best performing screening tools.\n\n\nResults\n153 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria.\n\n Because many studies validated two or more screening tools, this corresponded to 273 separate validations against gold standard diagnostic criteria.\n\n We found that the validity of every screening tool tested in multiple settings and populations varied between studies, highlighting the importance of local validation.\n\n Many of the best performing tools were purposely developed for a specific population; however, as these tools have only been validated in one study, it is not possible to draw broader conclusions about their applicability in other contexts.\n\n\nConclusions\nOf the tools that have been validated in multiple settings, the authors broadly recommend using the SRQ-20 to screen for general CMDs, the GHQ-12 for CMDs in populations with physical illness, the HADS-D for depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 for depressive disorders in populations with good literacy levels, the EPDS for perinatal depressive disorders, and the HADS-A for anxiety disorders.\n\n We recommend that, wherever possible, a chosen screening tool should be validated against a gold standard diagnostic assessment in the specific context in which it will be employed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4911088","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gemma-Claire","surname":"Ali","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Grace","surname":"Ryan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Grace","surname":"Ryan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mary

in older people: validity of the General Health Questionnaire, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the self-completion version of the revised Clinical Interview Schedule","abstract":"Background\nDiagnosis of depressive disorder using interviewer-administered instruments is expensive and frequently impractical in large epidemiological surveys.\n\n The aim of this study was to assess the validity of three self-completion measures of depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders in older people against an interviewer-administered instrument.\n\n\nMethod\nA random sample stratified by sex, age and social position was selected from the Whitehall II study participants.\n\n This sample was supplemented by inclusion of depressed Whitehall II participants.\n\n Depressive disorder and other mental disorders were assessed by the interviewer-administered structured revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) in 277 participants aged 5880 years.\n\n Participants also completed a computerized self-completion version of the CIS-R in addition to the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).\n\n\nResults\nThe mean total score was similar for the interviewer-administered (4.43) and self-completion (4.35) versions of the CIS-R [95% confidence interval (CI) for difference ?0.31 to 0.16].\n\n Differences were not related to sex, age, social position or presence of chronic physical illness.\n\n Sensitivity/specificity of self-completion CIS-R was 74%/98% for any mental disorder and 75%/98% for depressive episode.\n\n The corresponding figures were 86%/87% and 78%/83% for GHQ and 77%/89% and 89%/86% for CES-D.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe self-completion computerized version of the CIS-R is feasible and has good validity as a measure of any mental disorder and depression in people aged ? 60 years.\n\n GHQ and CES-D also have good criterion validity as measures of any mental disorder and depressive disorder respectively.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3821376","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"J.","surname":"Head","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.

university students in four European countries  Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nMental disorders and their symptoms are highly prevalent in the university student population, and the transition from secondary to tertiary education is associated with a rise in mental health problems.\n\n Existing web-based interventions for the prevention of common mental disorders in student populations often focus on just one disorder and have not been designed specifically for students.\n\n There is thus a need for transdiagnostic, student-specific preventative interventions that can be widely disseminated.\n\n This two-arm, parallel group randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a web-based transdiagnostic mental health problem prevention programme (PLUS) across several universities in four countries.\n\n\nMethod\nStudents (N?=?5550) will be recruited through a variety of channels and asked to complete a personality assessment to determine whether they are at high risk for developing common mental disorders.\n\n Students at high risk will be randomly allocated to either PLUS or a control intervention, which provides practical support around issues commonly experienced at university.\n\n Students at low risk will be allocated to the control intervention.\n\n Both intervention groups will be assessed at baseline, 4?weeks, 3?months, 6?months and 12?months after randomisation.\n\n Depression and generalised anxiety, assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scales, will form the primary outcomes in this study.\n\n Secondary outcome measures include alcohol and drug use, eating behaviour, self-esteem, and quality of life.\n\n The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be evaluated.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study will contribute to understanding the role of transdiagnostic indicated web-based interventions for the prevention of common mental disorders in university students.\n\n It will also be one of the first studies to investigate the cost-effectiveness of such interventions.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nThis trial was registered in the ISRCTN register (ISRCTN15570935) on 12th February

Eye of the Beholder","abstract":"To use a diagnostic test effectively and consistently in their practice, clinicians need to know how well the test distinguishes between those patients who have the suspected acute or chronic disease and those patients who do not.\n Clinicians are equally interested and usually more concerned whether, based on the results of a screening test, a given patient actually: (1) does or does not have the suspected disease; or (2) will or will not subsequently experience the adverse event or outcome.\n Medical tests that are performed to screen for a risk factor, diagnose a disease, or to estimate a patients prognosis are frequently a key component of a clinical research study.\n Like therapeutic interventions, medical tests require proper analysis and demonstrated efficacy before being incorporated into routine clinical practice.\n This basic statistical tutorial, thus, discusses the fundamental concepts and techniques related to diagnostic testing and medical decision-making, including sensitivity and specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, positive and negative likelihood ratio, receiver operating characteristic curve, diagnostic accuracy, choosing a best cut-point for a continuous variable biomarker, comparing methods on diagnostic accuracy, and design of a diagnostic accuracy

fibrosis (CF).\n\n\nDesign and setting\nCross-sectional study in CF clinics in Ireland and through the Cystic Fibrosis Ireland online community.\n\n\nParticipants\n160 adult patients aged 18 or above were recruited.\n\n Of these, 147 were included in the analysis; 83 online and 64 paper-based.\n\n The remaining 13 were excluded because of incomplete data.\n\n\nMeasures\nDepression and anxiety were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).\n\n Data on pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s %) and body mass index were self-reported based on clinical assessments.\n\n Sociodemographic data were collected.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with the paper-based participants, the online participants were more likely to be female (61.7% vs 48.4%), older (mean 32.2 vs 28.2 years) and were more likely to be married (32.5% vs 15.6%), living with their spouse or partner (42.5% vs 22.6%) and working either full time (33.7% vs 15.9%) or part time (30.1%vs 17.5%).\n\n The prevalence rates of elevated anxiety and depression were not significantly different (P=0.71 and P=0.56).\n\n HADS anxiety and depression scores were not statistically different between online (P=0.83) and paper-based (P=0.92) participants based on Mann-Whitney U test.\n\n A significant negative correlation was found between depression and pulmonary function (r=?0.39, P=0.01)

individuals with CF and parent caregivers have been associated with decreased lung function, lower body mass index, worse adherence, worse health-related quality of life, more frequent hospitalisations and increased healthcare costs.\n To identify and treat depression and anxiety in CF, the CF Foundation and the European CF Society invited a panel of experts, including physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, a pharmacist, parents and an individual with CF, to develop consensus recommendations for clinical care.\n Over 18?months, this 22-member committee was divided into four workgroups: Screening; Psychological Interventions; Pharmacological Treatments and Implementation and Future Research, and used the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome methodology to develop questions for literature search and review.\n Searches were conducted in PubMed, PsychINFO, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Psychiatry online and ABDATA by a methodologist at Dartmouth.\n The committee reviewed 344 articles, drafted statements and set an 80% acceptance for each recommendation statement as a consensus threshold prior to an anonymous voting process.\n Fifteen guideline recommendation statements for screening and treatment of depression and anxiety in individuals with CF and parent caregivers were finalised by vote.\n As these recommendations are implemented in CF centres internationally, the process of dissemination, implementation and resource provision should be closely monitored to assess barriers and concerns, validity

of Two Depression Instruments (BDI-II and MADRS-S) Administered to Clinic Patients","abstract":"Background\nSelf-report measures can guide clinical decisions and are useful when evaluating treatment outcomes.\n\n However, many clinicians do not use self-report measures systematically in their clinical practice.\n\n Internet-based questionnaires could facilitate administration, but the psychometric properties of the online version of an instrument should be explored before implementation.\n\n The recommendation from the International Test Commission is to test the psychometric properties of each questionnaire separately.\n\n\nObjective\nOur objective was to compare the psychometric properties of paper-and-pencil versions and Internet versions of two questionnaires measuring depressive symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nThe 87 participating patients were recruited from primary care and psychiatric care within the public health care system in Sweden.\n\n Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating ScaleSelf-rated (MADRS-S), both on paper and on the Internet.\n\n The order was randomized to control for order effects.\n\n Symptom severity in the sample ranged from mild to severe depressive symptoms.\n\n\nResults\nPsychometric properties of the two administration formats were mostly equivalent.\n\n The internal consistency was similar for the Internet and paper versions, and significant correlations were found between the formats for both MADRS-S (r = .\n\n84) and the BDI-II (r = .\n\n89).\n\n Differences between paper and Internet total scores were not statistically significant for either questionnaire nor for the MADRS-S question dealing with suicidality (item 9) when analyzed separately.\n\n The score on the BDI-II question about suicidality (item 9) was significantly lower when administered via the Internet compared with the paper score, but the difference was small (effect size, Cohens [d] = 0.14).\n\n There were significant main effects for order of administration on both questionnaires and significant interaction effects between format and order.\n\n This should not, however, pose a problem in clinical use as long as the administration format is not changed when repeated measurements are made.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe MADRS-S can be transferred to online use without affecting the psychometric properties in a clinically meaningful way.\n\n The full BDI-II also seems to retain its properties when transferred; however, the item measuring suicidality in the Internet version needs further investigation since it was associated with a lower score in this study.\n\n The use of online questionnaires offers clinicians a more practical way of measuring depressive symptoms and has the potential to save resources.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3057311","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pim","surname":"Cuijpers","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kate","surname":"Cavanagh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kate","surname":"Cavanagh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frances","surname":"Kay-Lambkin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fredrik","surname":"Holländare","email":"fredrik.hollandare@orebroll.se","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fredrik","surname":"Holländare","email":"fredrik.hollandare@orebroll.se","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gerhard","surname":"Andersson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ingemar","surname":"Engström","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/gps.3993","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Piloting

leading role in guiding the production of informed high-quality, timely research evidence syntheses","abstract":"Background\nPolicymakers and healthcare stakeholders are increasingly seeking evidence to inform the policymaking process, and often use existing or commissioned systematic reviews to inform decisions.\n\n However, the methodologies that make systematic reviews authoritative take time, typically 1 to 2 years to complete.\n\n Outside the traditional SR timeline, rapid reviews have emerged as an efficient tool to get evidence to decision-makers more quickly.\n\n However, the use of rapid reviews does present challenges.\n\n To date, there has been limited published empirical information about this approach to compiling evidence.\n\n Thus, it remains a poorly understood and ill-defined set of diverse methodologies with various labels.\n\n In recent years, the need to further explore rapid review methods, characteristics, and their use has been recognized by a growing network of healthcare researchers, policymakers, and organizations, several with ties to Cochrane, which is recognized as representing an international gold standard for high-quality, systematic reviews.\n\n\nPurpose\nIn this commentary, we introduce the newly established Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group developed to play a leading role in guiding the production of rapid reviews given they are increasingly employed as a research synthesis tool to support timely evidence-informed decision-making.\n\n We discuss how the group was formed and outline the groups structure and remit.\n\n We also discuss the need to establish a more robust evidence base for rapid reviews in the published literature, and the importance of promoting registration of rapid review protocols in an effort to promote efficiency and transparency in research.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs with standard systematic reviews, the core principles of evidence-based synthesis should apply to rapid reviews in order

are the best methodologies for rapid reviews of the research evidence for evidence-informed decision making in health policy and practice: a rapid review","abstract":"Background\nRapid reviews have the potential to overcome a key barrier to the use of research evidence in decision making, namely that of the lack of timely and relevant research.\n\n This rapid review of systematic reviews and primary studies sought to answer the question: What are the best methodologies to enable a rapid review of research evidence for evidence-informed decision making in health policy and practice?\nMethods\nThis rapid review utilised systematic review methods and was conducted according to a pre-defined protocol including clear inclusion criteria (PROSPERO registration: CRD42015015998).\n\n A comprehensive search strategy was used, including published and grey literature, written in English, French, Portuguese or Spanish, from 2004 onwards.\n\n Eleven databases and two websites were searched.\n\n Two review authors independently applied the eligibility criteria.\n\n Data extraction was done by one reviewer and checked by a second.\n\n The methodological quality of included studies was assessed independently by two reviewers.\n\n A narrative summary of the results is presented.\n\n\nResults\nFive systematic reviews and one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that investigated methodologies for rapid reviews met the inclusion criteria.\n\n None of the systematic reviews were of sufficient quality to allow firm conclusions to be made.\n\n Thus, the findings need to be treated with caution.\n\n There is no agreed definition of rapid reviews in the literature and no agreed methodology for conducting rapid reviews.\n\n While a wide range of shortcuts are used to make rapid reviews faster than a full systematic review, the included studies found little empirical evidence of their impact on the conclusions of either rapid or systematic reviews.\n\n There is some evidence from the included RCT (that had a low risk of bias) that rapid reviews may improve clarity and accessibility of research evidence for decision makers.\n\n\nConclusions\nGreater care needs to be taken in improving the transparency of the methods used in rapid review products.\n\n There is no evidence available to suggest that rapid reviews should not be done or that they are misleading in any way.\n\n We offer an improved definition of rapid reviews to guide future research as well as clearer guidance for policy and practice.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe

needs of the review and each review had distinctly different challenges such as heterogeneity in terms of populations, interventions, comparators and outcome measures (PICO) and/or large numbers of relevant trials.\n\n All reviews included at least 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), each with numerous included outcomes.\n\n For the first case study (sexual health interventions), very diverse studies in terms of PICO were included.\n\n P-values and summary information only were presented due to substantial heterogeneity between studies and outcomes measured.\n\n For the second case

identification methods in systematic reviews","abstract":"Background\nMeta-research studies investigating methods, systems, and processes designed to improve the efficiency of systematic review workflows can contribute to building an evidence base that can help to increase value and reduce waste in research.\n\n This study demonstrates the use of an economic evaluation framework to compare the costs and effects of four variant approaches to identifying eligible studies for consideration in systematic reviews.\n\n\nMethods\nA cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a basic decision-analytic model, to compare the relative efficiency of safety first, double screening, single screening and single screening with text mining approaches in the title-abstract screening stage of a case study systematic review about undergraduate medical education in UK general practice settings.\n\n Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the incremental cost per citation saved from inappropriate exclusion from the review.\n\n Resource use and effect parameters were estimated based on retrospective analysis of review process meta-data curated alongside the case study review, in conjunction with retrospective simulation studies to model the integrated use of text mining.\n\n Unit cost parameters were estimated based on the case study reviews project budget.\n\n A base case analysis was conducted, with deterministic sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of variations in values of key parameters.\n\n\nResults\nUse of single screening with text mining would have resulted in title-abstract screening workload reductions (base case analysis) of &gt;60 % compared with other approaches.\n\n Across modelled scenarios, the safety first approach was, consistently, equally effective and less costly than conventional double screening.\n\n Compared with single screening with text mining, estimated ICERs for the two non-dominated approaches (base case analyses) ranged from £1975 (single screening without a provisionally included code) to £4427 (safety first with a provisionally included code) per citation saved.\n\n Patterns of results were consistent between base case and sensitivity analyses.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlternatives to the conventional double screening approach, integrating text mining, warrant further consideration as potentially more efficient approaches to identifying eligible studies for systematic reviews.\n\n Comparable economic evaluations conducted using other systematic review datasets are needed to determine the generalisability of these findings and to build an evidence base to inform guidance for review

worries, perceived sufficiency of information and associated psychological distress during the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic","abstract":"Background\nHealth care workers (HCWs) presented frequent concerns regarding their health and their families' health and high levels of psychological distress during previous disease outbreaks, such as the SARS outbreak, which was associated with social isolation and intentional absenteeism.\n\n We aimed to assess HCWs concerns and anxiety, perceived sufficiency of information, and intended behavior during the recent A/H1N1 influenza pandemic and their associations with psychological distress.\n\n\nMethod\nBetween September 1st and 30th, 2009, 469 health-care workers (HCWs) of a tertiary teaching hospital completed a 20-item questionnaire regarding concerns and worries about the new A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, along with Cassileth's Information Styles Questionnaire (part-I) and the GHQ-28.\nResults\nMore than half of the present study's HCWs (56.7%) reported they were worried about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, their degree of anxiety being moderately high (median 6/9).\n\n The most frequent concern was infection of family and friends and the health consequences of the disease (54.9%).\n\n The perceived risk of being infected was considered moderately high (median 6/9).\n\n Few HCWs (6.6%) had restricted their social contacts and fewer (3.8%) felt isolated by their family members and friends because of their hospital work, while a low percentage (4.3%) indented to take a leave to avoid infection.\n\n However, worry and degree of worry were significantly associated with intended absenteeism (p &lt; 0.0005), restriction of social contacts (p &lt; 0.0005), and psychological distress (p = 0.036).\n\n Perceived sufficiency of information about several aspects of the A/H1N1 influenza was moderately high, and the overall information about the A/H1N1 influenza was considered clear (median 7.4/9).\n\n Also, perceived sufficiency of information for the prognosis of the infection was significantly independently associated with the degree of worry about the pandemic (p = 0.008).\n\n\nConclusions\nA significant proportion of HCWs experienced moderately high anxiety about the pandemic, and their degree of worry was an independent correlate of psychological distress.\n\n Since perceived sufficiency of information about the A/H1N1 influenza prognosis was associated with reduced degree of worry, hospital managers and consultation-liaison psychiatry services should try to provide for HCWs' need for information, in order to offer favourable working conditions in times of extreme distress, such as the current and future pandemics.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2990753","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Panagiota","surname":"Goulia","email":"panagiotagoulia@yahoo.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christos","surname":"Mantas","email":"chmantas@cc.uoi.gr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Danai","surname":"Dimitroula","email":"danaed75@otenet.gr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dimitrios","surname":"Mantis","email":"mantisdi@otenet.gr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Hyphantis","email":"tyfantis@cc.uoi.gr","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/occmed/kqh027","date":"2003-12-02","title":"Psychological

feeling of low personal accomplishment.\n In this review, we discuss the contributing factors leading to physician burnout and its consequences for the physicians health, patient outcomes, and the healthcare system.\n Physicians face daily challenges in providing care to their patients, and burnout may be from increased stress levels in overworked physicians.\n Additionally, the healthcare system mandates physicians to keep a meticulous record of their physician-patient encounters along with clerical responsibilities.\n Physicians are not well-trained in managing clerical duties, and this might shift their focus from solely caring for their patients.\n This can be addressed by the systematic application of evidence-based interventions, including but not limited to group interventions, mindfulness training, assertiveness training, facilitated discussion groups, and promoting a healthy work environment.\n","id":"PMC6262585","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rikinkumar

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?\nFindings\nIn this cross-sectional study of 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in multiple regions of China, a considerable proportion of health care workers reported experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, especially women, nurses, those in Wuhan, and

and Prevention and other organizations, the educational landscape for surgical residents is rapidly changing.\n\n In addition, the time course of these changes is undefined.\n\n\nMethods\nWe attempt to define the scope of the problem of maintaining surgical resident education while maintaining the safety of residents, educators, and patients.\n\n Within the basic framework of limiting in-person gatherings, postponing or canceling elective operations in hospitals, and limiting rotations between sites, we propose innovative solutions to maintain rigorous education.\n\n\nResults\nWe propose several innovative solutions including the flipped classroom model, online practice questions, teleconferencing in place of in-person lectures, involving residents in telemedicine clinics, procedural simulation, and the facilitated use of surgical videos.\n\n Although there is no substitute for hands-on learning through operative experience and direct patient care, these may be ways to mitigate the loss of learning exposure during this time.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese innovative solutions utilizing technology may help to bridge the educational gap for surgical residents during this unprecedented circumstance.\n\n The support of national organizations may be beneficial in maintaining rigorous surgical education.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270491","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert Connor","surname":"Chick","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guy

Fidelity Testing of the Test@Work Digital Toolkit for Employers on Workplace Health Checks and Opt-In HIV Testing","abstract":"Background: In the UK, few employers offer general health checks for employees, and opt-in HIV testing is rarely included.\n There is a need to provide evidence-based guidance and support for employers around health checks and HIV testing in the workplace.\n An Agile approach was used to develop and evaluate a digital toolkit to facilitate employers understanding about workplace health screening.\n Methods: The Test@Work toolkit development included an online survey (STAGE 1: n = 201), stakeholder consultation (STAGE 2: n = 19), expert peer review (STAGE 3: n = 24), and pilot testing (STAGE 4: n = 20).\n The toolkit includes employer guidance on workplace health promotion, workplace health screening, and confidential opt-in HIV testing with signposting to resources.\n Pilot testing included assessment of fidelity (delivery and engagement) and implementation qualities (attitudes, resources, practicality, acceptability, usability and cost).\n Results: STAGE 1: The vast majority of respondents would consider offering general health checks in the workplace that included confidential opt-in HIV testing, and this view was broadly comparable across organisation types (n = 201; public: 87.8%; private: 89.7%; third: 87.1%).\n STAGES 2 and 3: Stakeholders highlighted essential content considerations: (1) inclusion of the business case for workplace health initiatives, (2) clear pathways to employer responsibilities, and (3) presenting HIV-related information alongside other areas of health.\n With regards presentation, stakeholders proposed that the toolkit should be concise, with clear signposting and be hosted on a trusted portal.\n STAGE 4: Employers were satisfied with the toolkit content, usability and utility.\n The toolkit had high fidelity with regards to delivery and employer engagement.\n Assessment of implementation qualities showed high usability and practicality, with low perceived burden for completion and acceptable cost implications.\n Very few resource challenges were reported, and the toolkit was considered to be appropriate for any type of organisation, irrespective of size or resources.\n Conclusions: Employers perceived the Test@Work toolkit to be useful, meaningful and appropriate for their needs.\n This digital resource could be used to support employers to engage with health screening and opt-in HIV testing within the context of workplace health promotion.\n","id":"PMC6982120","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Holly","surname":"Blake","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"Somerset","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"Somerset","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Catrin","surname":"Evans","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.amepre.2016.06.008","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evaluating

Survey of UK Healthcare Workers Attitudes on Volunteering to Help with the Ebola Outbreak in West Africa","abstract":"Objective\nTo understand the barriers and enablers for UK healthcare workers who are considering going to work in the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, but have not yet volunteered.\n\n\nDesign\nAfter focus group discussions, and a pilot questionnaire, an anonymous survey was conducted using SurveyMonkey to determine whether people had considered going to West Africa, what factors might make them more or less likely to volunteer, and whether any of these were modifiable factors.\n\n\nParticipants\nThe survey was publicised among doctors, nurses, laboratory staff and allied health professionals.\n\n 3109 people answered the survey, of whom 472 (15%) were considering going to work in the epidemic but had not yet volunteered.\n\n 1791 (57.6%) had not considered going, 704 (22.6%) had considered going but decided not to, 53 (1.7%) had volunteered to go and 14 (0.45%) had already been and worked in the epidemic.\n\n\nResults\nFor those considering going to West Africa, the most important factor preventing them from volunteering was a lack of information to help them decide; fear of getting Ebola and partners concerns came next.\n\n Uncertainty about their potential role, current work commitments and inability to get agreement from their employer were also important barriers, whereas clarity over training would be an important enabler.\n\n In contrast, for those who were not considering going, or who had decided against going, family considerations and partner concerns were the most important factors.\n\n\nConclusions\nMore UK healthcare workers would volunteer to help tackle Ebola in West Africa if there was better information available, including clarity about roles, cover arrangements, and training.\n\n This could be achieved with a well-publicised high quality portal of reliable information.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4356617","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lance","surname":"Turtle","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fiona","surname":"McGill","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Judy","surname":"Bettridge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claire","surname":"Matata","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rob","surname":"Christley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Solomon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ann

the growth and progression of oral cancer.\n\n Patients with oral neoplasms can have high psychological distress levels, but the effects of stress-related hormones on oral neoplasm growth are unknown.\n\n\nMethods\nWe have investigated the relationships between pre-surgical measurements of psychological problems with Symptom Checklist-90-revised Inventory (SCL90-R), tumor histology, circulating blood catecholamine and glucocorticoid levels among 75 oral neoplasm patients, including 40 oral cancer patients and 35 benign oral tumor patients.\n\n\nResults\nThe results showed that most dimension scores of SCL90-R did not show a significant difference between the two groups except depression (p?=?0.0201) and obsessive-compulsion (p?=?0.0093), with the scores for these symptoms being higher among oral cancer group versus the benign oral tumor group.\n\n The differences of total score, average score and other monomial factor scores were not statistically significant.\n\n The mean concentrations of catecholamine and glucocorticoid in peripheral blood of the oral cancer group were higher than those in benign oral tumor group (p&lt;0.01).\n\n We also examined whether associations observed between biobehavioral measures and circulating blood catecholamine and glucocorticoid levels extended to other compartments in the oral cancer group.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese

Four hundred and twenty five people developed clinical symptoms in three geographically distinct parts of the country (Gulu, Masindi, and Mbarara), of whom 224 (53%) died.\n\n Given the focus of previous social scientific Ebola research on experiences in communities that have been directly affected, this article expands the lens to include responses to the outbreak in local, national, and international contexts over the course of the outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nResponses to the outbreak were gauged through the articles, editorials, cartoons, and letters that were published in the countrys two main English language daily national newspapers: the New Vision and the Monitor (now the Daily Monitor).\n\n All the relevant pieces from these two sources over the course of the epidemic were cut out, entered onto a computer, and the originals filed.\n\n The three a priori codes, based on the local, national, and international levels, were expanded into six, to include issues that emerged inductively during analysis.\n\n The data within each code were subsequently worked into coherent, chronological narratives.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 639 cuttings were included in the analysis.\n\n Strong and varied responses to the outbreak were identified from across the globe.\n\n These included, among others: confusion, anger, and serious stigma in affected communities; medical staff working themselves to exhaustion, with some quitting their posts; patients fleeing from hospitals; calls on spiritual forces for protection against infection; a well-coordinated national control strategy; and the imposition of some international travel restrictions.\n\n Responses varied both quantitatively and qualitatively according to the level (i.\n\ne.\n\n local, national, or international) at which they were manifested.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe Ugandan experience of 2000/2001 demonstrates that responses to an Ebola outbreak can be very dramatic, but perhaps disproportionate to the actual danger presented.\n\n An important objective for any future outbreak control strategy must be to prevent excessive fear, which, it is expected, would reduce stigma and other negative outcomes.\n\n To this end, the value of openness in the provision of public information, and critically, of being seen to be open, cannot be overstated.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3477054","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"John","surname":"Kinsman","email":"john.kinsman@epiph.umu.se","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Addressing Ebola-related stigma: lessons learned from HIV/AIDS","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2105/AJPH.2015.302790","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ebola Outbreak: From the Perspective of African Migrants in China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Support services for survivors of ebola virus disease - Sierra Leone, 2014","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/516323a","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Infectious disease: Mobilizing Ebola survivors to curb the epidemic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/519013a","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ebola's mental-health wounds linger in Africa","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The mental health of medical workers in Wuhan, China dealing with the 2019 novel coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern","abstract":"","id":"PMC7135038","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"cyh-birm@263.net","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter W","surname":"Horby","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick G","surname":"Hayden","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30186-0","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Emerging understandings of 2019-nCoV","abstract":"","id":"PMC7134625","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"The Lancet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Occupational injury insurance supports occupational injury &quot;protection umbrella&quot;

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team, Li Q.

the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome.\n Many initial patients were exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold.\n To investigate possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019?nCoV sequence.\n Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019?nCoV may appear to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin?unknown coronavirus.\n The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor.\n Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019?nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and most similar codon usage bias with snake.\n Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination may occur and

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui
