Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

Kaplan–Meier plots.\n The associations of vitamin D supplementation with infant RTI, lower RTI (LRTI), and RTI?related hospitalization were assessed using modified Poisson regression.\n The median time to first RTI episode was 60 days after birth (95% CI [60, 90]) for infants without supplementation and longer than 6 months of age for infants with supplementation (p &lt; .\n001).\n We observed inverse trends between supplementation frequency and risk of RTI, LRTI, and RTI?related hospitalization (p for trend &lt; .\n001), with the risk ratios in the 5–7 days/week supplementation group of 0.46 (95% CI [0.41, 0.50]), 0.17 (95% CI [0.13, 0.24]), and 0.18 (95% CI [0.12, 0.27]), respectively.\n These associations were significant and consistent in a subgroup analysis stratified by infant feeding.\n","id":"PMC7296792","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Miao","surname":"Hong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junmei","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuanjue","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lixia","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Duan","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huanzhuo","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chun","surname":"Kang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qin","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuefeng","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nianhong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nianhong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liping","surname":"Hao","email":"haolp@mails.tjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1008341","date":"2020-01-21","title":"Identification

virus results in acute lung injury (ALI) and has a high mortality rate (52.79%) because there are limited therapies available for treatment.\n Drug repositioning is an economical approach to drug discovery.\n We developed a method for drug repositioning based on high-throughput RNA sequencing and identified several drugs as potential treatments for avian influenza A H5N1 virus.\n Using high-throughput RNA sequencing, we identified a total of 1,233 genes differentially expressed in A549 cells upon H5N1 virus infection.\n Among these candidate genes, 79 drug targets (corresponding to 59 approved drugs) overlapped with the DrugBank target database.\n Twenty-two of the 41 commercially available small-molecule drugs reduced H5N1-mediated cell death in cultured A549 cells, and fifteen drugs that protected A549 cells when administered both pre- and post-infection were tested in an H5N1-infection mouse model.\n The results showed significant alleviation of acute lung injury by amitriptyline HCl (an antidepressant drug), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD; an ophthalmic agent for vitamin B2 deficiency), azacitidine (an anti-neoplastic drug) and calcitriol (an active form of vitamin D).\n All four agents significantly reduced the infiltrating cell count and decreased the lung injury score in H5N1 virus-infected mice based on lung histopathology, significantly improved mouse lung edema by reducing the wet-to-dry weight ratio of lung tissue and significantly improved the survival of H5N1 virus-infected mice.\n This study not only identifies novel potential therapies for influenza H5N1 virus-induced lung injury but also provides a highly effective and economical screening method for repurposing drugs that may be generalizable for the prevention and therapy of other

activating genes related to innate and adaptive immunity.\n In this study, we analyzed the association among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, with clinical patterns of AIDS progression in antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naïve HIV-infected patients.\n Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in 667 HIV-infected patients, who were classified within three groups according to their AIDS progression pattern (183 long-term non-progressors (LTNPs), 334 moderate progressors (MPs), and 150 rapid progressors (RPs)).\n Five VDR SNPs (rs11568820, rs4516035, rs2228570, rs1544410, and rs7975232) were genotyped using Agena Bioscience’s MassARRAY platform.\n Results: Significant association results were found for rs2228570. Within all HIV patients, the presence of T allele at VDR rs2228570 SNP was protective against AIDS progression (ordinal outcome) under additive (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.75; p = 0.009), dominant (aOR = 0.69; p = 0.015), and codominant (aOR = 0.56; p = 0.017) inheritance models.\n In addition, the same allele was protective under additive and codominant inheritance models when we compared with LTNPs vs.\n RPs [aOR = 0.64 (p = 0.019) and aOR = 0.37 (p = 0.018), respectively] and when we compared MPs vs.\n RPs [aOR = 0.72 (p = 0.035) and aOR = 0.45 (p = 0.028), respectively].\n Conclusions: The VDR rs2228570 T allele was related to a lower AIDS progression pattern in ART-naïve HIV-infected patients.\n These findings expand upon the knowledge about HIV pathogenesis in untreated

D in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection: Influence on Immunity and Disease","abstract":"People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection typically have hypovitaminosis D, which is linked to a large number of pathologies, including immune disorders and infectious diseases.\n Vitamin D (VitD) is a key regulator of host defense against infections by activating genes and pathways that enhance innate and adaptive immunity.\n VitD mediates its biological effects by binding to the Vitamin D receptor (VDR), and activating and regulating multiple cellular pathways.\n Single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes from those pathways have been associated with protection from HIV-1 infection.\n High levels of VitD and VDR expression are also associated with natural resistance to HIV-1 infection.\n Conversely, VitD deficiency is linked to more inflammation and immune activation, low peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells, faster progression of HIV disease, and shorter survival time in HIV-infected patients.\n VitD supplementation and restoration to normal values in HIV-infected patients may improve immunologic recovery during combination antiretroviral therapy, reduce levels of inflammation and immune activation, and increase immunity against pathogens.\n Additionally, VitD may protect against the development of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome events, pulmonary tuberculosis, and mortality among HIV-infected patients.\n In summary, this review suggests that VitD deficiency may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.\n Also, VitD supplementation seems to reverse some alterations of the immune system, supporting the use of VitD supplementation as prophylaxis, especially in individuals with more severe VitD deficiency.\n","id":"PMC5857570","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"María

vitamin D3 on induction of inflammatory cytokines was also assessed.\n Gene expression of the vitamin D receptor and vitamin D-metabolizing enzymes was observed in both human pulmonary fibroblast cell

expression of fibrosis markers/fibrosis inducers was decreased by a high vitamin D3 diet.\n Vitamin D3 is activated locally in lung tissues, suggesting that high dietary intake of vitamin D3 may have

investigate whether, and by which mechanism, vitamin D alleviates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.\n The results demonstrated that a vitamin D agonist, calcitriol, exhibited a beneficial effect on LPS-induced ALI in rats; calcitriol pretreatment significantly improved LPS-induced lung permeability, as determined using Evans blue dye.\n Results from reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and ELISA analysis demonstrated that calcitriol also modulated the expression of members of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including angiotensin (Ang) I-converting enzymes (ACE and ACE2), renin and Ang II, which indicates that calcitriol may exert protective effects on LPS-induced lung injury, at least partially, by regulating the balance between

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

Therapy?","abstract":"Vitamin D generates many extraskeletal effects due to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) which is present in most tissues throughout the body.\n The possible role of vitamin D in infections is implied from its impact on the innate and adaptive immune responses.\n A significant effect is also the suppression of inflammatory processes.\n Because vitamin D could be acknowledged as a “seasonal stimulus”, as defined by R.\n Edgar Hope-Simpson, it would be crucial to prove it from a potential easy and cheap prophylaxis or therapy support perspective as far as influenza infections are concerned.\n The survey of the literature data generates some controversies and doubts about the possible role of vitamin D in the prevention of influenza virus.\n The most important point is to realise that the broad spectrum of this vitamin’s activity does not exclude such a possibility.\n According to most of the authors, more randomized controlled trials with effective, large populations are needed to explore the preventive effect of vitamin D supplementation on viral influenza infections.\n","id":"PMC6121423","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Beata

and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","abstract":"Background\nLow levels of 25-OH vitamin D are associated with respiratory tract infection (RTI).\n\n However, results from randomized controlled trials are inconclusive.\n\n Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the preventive effect of vitamin D supplementation on RTI.\n\n\nMethods\nRandomized, controlled trials of vitamin D for prevention of RTI were used for the analysis.\n\n The risks of within-trial and publication bias were assessed.\n\n Odds ratios of RTI were pooled using a random-effects model.\n\n Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q and I2.\n\n Meta-regressions and subgroup analyses were used to assess the influence of various factors on trial outcome.\n\n The pre-defined review protocol was registered at the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews, registration number CRD42013003530.\nFindings\nOf 1137 citations retrieved, 11 placebo-controlled studies of 5660 patients were included in the meta-analysis.\n\n Overall, vitamin D showed a protective effect against RTI (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.84).\n\n There was significant heterogeneity among studies (Cohran's Q p&lt;0.0001, I2?=?72%).\n\n The protective effect was larger in studies using once-daily dosing compared to bolus doses (OR?=?0.51 vs OR?=?0.86, p?=?0.01).\n\n There was some evidence that results may have been influenced by publication bias.\n\n\nInterpretation\nResults indicate that vitamin D has a protective effect against RTI, and dosing once-daily seems most effective.\n\n Due to heterogeneity of included studies and possible publication bias in the field, these results should be interpreted with caution.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3686844","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Bergman","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Åsa

that Vitamin D Supplementation Could Reduce Risk of Influenza and COVID-19 Infections and Deaths","abstract":"The world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed.\n This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk.\n Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections.\n Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines.\n Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not.\n Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration.\n To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d.\n The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40–60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L).\n For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful.\n Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.\n","id":"PMC7231123","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"William

including the liver, where its physiological role remains unknown.\n Recently, we reported a physical and functional interaction of DDC with the major signaling regulator phosphoinosite-3-kinase (PI3K).\n Here, we provide compelling evidence for the involvement of DDC in viral infections.\n Studying dengue (DENV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus infection in hepatocytes and HCV replication in liver samples of infected patients, we observed a negative association between DDC and viral replication.\n Specifically, replication of both viruses reduced the levels of DDC mRNA and the ~120 kDa SDS-resistant DDC immunoreactive functional complex, concomitant with a PI3K-dependent accumulation of the ~50 kDa DDC monomer.\n Moreover, viral infection inhibited PI3K-DDC association, while DDC did not colocalize with viral replication sites.\n DDC overexpression suppressed DENV and HCV RNA replication, while DDC enzymatic inhibition enhanced viral replication and infectivity and affected DENV-induced cell death.\n Consistently, we observed an inverse correlation between DDC mRNA and HCV RNA levels in liver biopsies from chronically infected patients.\n These data reveal a novel relationship between DDC and Flaviviridae replication cycle and the role of PI3K in this

2020. At the onset of the pandemic in Ghana, there were challenges in securing isolation centers and quarantine facilities.\n Nonetheless, the government of Ghana put in place a number of measures in line with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, to halt the spread of the virus.\n Some measures taken by the government included partial lockdown of areas deemed hotspots for the spread of the virus.\n In April 2020, Ghana was ranked number one among African countries in administering tests per million people, because of the effective “trace and test” approach.\n The government of Ghana also encouraged local manufacturing of personal protective equipment, antivirals and hand sanitizers to help meet the demand of the nation.\n There were also restrictions on public gathering within the early parts of 2020, and these were eased with time.\n In February 2021, Ghana became the first country to receive vaccines through the COVAX initiative with a delivery of 600,000 doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines.\n The efforts by Ghana to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic have been commendable.\n Not withstanding, the adverse impact of the COVID-19 on public health in Ghana has been significant, and there is still a lot to learn from other countries in the sub-region, and the world as whole.\n","id":"PMC8486924","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Seth Kwabena","surname":"Amponsah","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Benjamin","surname":"Tagoe","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Daniel Kwame","surname":"Afriyie","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.11604/pamj.2021.40.157.31905","date":"2021-10-23","title":"Possible future trajectory of COVID-19: emphasis on Africa","abstract":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused morbidity and mortality in many countries.\n COVID-19 has also negatively affected the economy of several nations.\n The dynamics of interaction between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and host, and possible evolution of the virus into more virulent strains pose a threat to global eradication.\n With the advent of vaccination in most countries, vaccine hesitancy, especially in Africa, is expected to reduce.\n We also believe that the COVID-19 vaccine would have substantial impact on reducing incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths.\n A predictor model for COVID-19 infection pattern through to 2025 suggests that recurrent outbreaks are likely to occur.\n There is a prediction that Africa would not fully recover from the economic crises posed by the pandemic;

and <italic>in vivo</italic> Efficacy Assessment of Approved Orally Bioavailable Human Host Protein-Targeting Drugs With Broad Anti-influenza A Activity","abstract":"The high genetic variability of influenza A viruses poses a continual challenge to seasonal and pandemic vaccine development, leaving antiviral drugs as the first line of defense against antigenically different strains or new subtypes.\n As resistance against drugs targeting viral proteins emerges rapidly, we assessed the antiviral activity of already approved drugs that target cellular proteins involved in the viral life cycle and were orally bioavailable.\n Out of 15 candidate compounds, four were able to inhibit infection by 10- to 100-fold without causing toxicity, in vitro.\n Two of the drugs, dextromethorphan and ketotifen, displayed a 50% effective dose between 5 and 50 ?M, not only for the classic H1N1 PR8 strain, but also for a pandemic H1N1 and a seasonal H3N2 strain.\n Efficacy assessment in mice revealed that dextromethorphan consistently resulted in a significant reduction of viral lung titers and also enhanced the efficacy of oseltamivir.\n Dextromethorphan treatment of ferrets infected with a pandemic H1N1 strain led to a reduction in clinical disease severity, but no effect on viral titer was observed.\n In addition to identifying dextromethorphan as a potential influenza treatment option, our study illustrates the feasibility of a bioinformatics-driven rational approach for repurposing approved drugs against infectious diseases.\n","id":"PMC6563844","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Theresa","surname":"Enkirch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Svenja","surname":"Sauber","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Danielle

hospitalisation (PHOSP-COVID): a UK multicentre, prospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nThe impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health and employment after hospitalisation with acute disease is not well understood.\n\n The aim of this study was to determine the effects of COVID-19-related hospitalisation on health and employment, to identify factors associated with recovery, and to describe recovery phenotypes.\n\n\nMethods\nThe Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a multicentre, long-term follow-up study of adults (aged ?18 years) discharged from hospital in the UK with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, involving an assessment between 2 and 7 months after discharge, including detailed recording of symptoms, and physiological and biochemical testing.\n\n Multivariable logistic regression was done for the primary outcome of patient-perceived recovery, with age, sex, ethnicity, body-mass index, comorbidities, and severity of acute illness as covariates.\n\n A post-hoc cluster analysis of outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognitive impairment, and physical performance was done using the clustering large applications k-medoids approach.\n\n The study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN10980107).\n\n\nFindings\nWe report findings for 1077 patients discharged from hospital between March 5 and Nov 30, 2020, who underwent assessment at a median of 5·9 months (IQR 4·9–6·5) after discharge.\n\n Participants had a mean age of 58 years (SD 13); 384 (36%) were female, 710 (69%) were of white ethnicity, 288 (27%) had received mechanical ventilation, and 540 (50%) had at least two comorbidities.\n\n At follow-up, only 239 (29%) of 830 participants felt fully recovered, 158 (20%) of 806 had a new disability (assessed by the Washington Group Short Set on Functioning), and 124 (19%) of 641 experienced a health-related change in occupation.\n\n Factors associated with not recovering were female sex, middle age (40–59 years), two or more comorbidities, and more severe acute illness.\n\n The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial but only weakly associated with the severity of acute illness.\n\n Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment (n=767): very severe (131 patients, 17%), severe (159, 21%), moderate along with cognitive impairment (127, 17%), and mild (350, 46%).\n\n Of the outcomes used in the cluster analysis, all were closely related except for cognitive impairment.\n\n Three (3%) of 113 patients in the very severe cluster, nine (7%) of 129 in the severe cluster, 36 (36%) of 99 in the moderate cluster, and 114 (43%) of 267 in the mild cluster reported feeling fully recovered.\n\n Persistently elevated serum C-reactive protein was positively associated with cluster severity.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe identified factors related to not recovering after hospital admission with COVID-19 at 6 months after discharge (eg, female sex, middle age, two or more comorbidities, and more acute severe illness), and four different recovery phenotypes.\n\n The severity of physical and mental health impairments were closely related, whereas cognitive health impairments were independent.\n\n In clinical care, a proactive approach is needed across the acute severity spectrum, with interdisciplinary working, wide access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services, and the potential to stratify care.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Research and Innovation and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8497028","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rachael

for COVID-19 Therapy: Potential Implications on Tuberculosis","abstract":"On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic, which originated in China.\n At the host level, COVID-19, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), affects the respiratory system, with the clinical symptoms ranging from mild to severe or critical illness that often requires hospitalization and oxygen support.\n There is no specific therapy for COVID-19, as is the case for any common viral disease except drugs to reduce the viral load and alleviate the inflammatory symptoms.\n Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), also primarily affects the lungs and has clinical signs similar to pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Active TB is a leading killer among infectious diseases and adds to the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.\n In immunocompetent individuals, primary Mtb infection can also lead to a non-progressive, asymptomatic latency.\n However, latent Mtb infection (LTBI) can reactivate symptomatic TB disease upon host immune-suppressing conditions.\n Importantly, the diagnosis and treatment of TB are hampered and admixed with COVID-19 control measures.\n The US-Center for Disease Control (US-CDC) recommends using antiviral drugs, Remdesivir or corticosteroid (CST), such as dexamethasone either alone or in-combination with specific recommendations for COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization or oxygen support.\n However, CSTs can cause immunosuppression, besides their anti-inflammatory properties.\n The altered host immunity during COVID-19, combined with CST therapy, poses a significant risk for new secondary infections and/or reactivation of existing quiescent infections, such as LTBI.\n This review highlights CST therapy recommendations for COVID-19, various types and mechanisms of action of CSTs, the deadly combination of two respiratory infectious diseases COVID-19 and TB.\n It also discusses the importance of screening for LTBI to prevent TB reactivation during corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19.","id":"PMC8038708","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Radha","surname":"Gopalaswamy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Selvakumar","surname":"Subbian","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Selvakumar","surname":"Subbian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anastasios","surname":"Lymperopoulos","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Anastasios","surname":"Lymperopoulos","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anastasios","surname":"Lymperopoulos","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.78.19.10303-10309.2004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Signaling

and “reactive” subphenotype (cluster?model) and “hypo?inflammatory” and “hyper?inflammatory” (latent class analysis (LCA) model).\n The distinction between the subphenotypes is mainly driven by inflammatory and coagulation markers in plasma.\n However, systemic inflammation is not specific for ARDS and it is unknown whether these subphenotypes also reflect differences in the alveolar compartment.\n Alveolar inflammation and dysbiosis of the lung microbiome have shown to be important mediators in the development of lung injury.\n This study aimed to determine whether the “reactive” or “hyper?inflammatory” biological subphenotype also had higher concentrations of inflammatory mediators and enrichment of gut?associated bacteria in the lung.\n Levels of alveolar inflammatory mediators myeloperoxidase (MPO), surfactant protein D (SPD), interleukin (IL)?1b, IL?6, IL?10, IL?8, interferon gamma (IFN??), and tumor necrosis factor?alpha (TNF?) were determined in the mini?BAL fluid.\n Key features of the lung microbiome were measured: bacterial burden (16S rRNA gene copies/ml), community diversity (Shannon Diversity Index), and community composition.\n No statistically significant differences between the “uninflamed” and “reactive” ARDS subphenotypes were found in a selected set of alveolar inflammatory mediators and key features of the lung microbiome.\n LCA?derived subphenotypes and stratification based on cause of ARDS (direct vs.\n indirect) showed similar profiles, suggesting that current subphenotypes may not reflect the alveolar host response.\n It is important for future research to elucidate the pulmonary biology within each subphenotype properly, which is arguably a target for intervention.\n","id":"PMC7865405","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nanon F.

NSAID users (defined as individuals having filled a prescription for NSAIDs up to 30 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test) were matched to up to 4 non-users on calendar week of the test date and propensity scores based on age, sex, relevant comorbidities, and use of selected prescription drugs.\n\n The main outcome was 30-day mortality, and NSAID users were compared to non-users using risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs).\n\n Secondary outcomes included hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and acute renal replacement therapy.\n\n A total of 9,236 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive individuals were eligible for inclusion.\n\n The median age in the study cohort was 50 years, and 58% were female.\n\n Of these, 248 (2.7%) had filled a prescription for NSAIDs, and 535 (5.8%) died within 30 days.\n\n In the matched analyses, treatment with NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.82, p = 0.95; RD 0.1%, 95% CI ?3.5%

continuously, and possible residual confounding by indication, as NSAIDs may generally be prescribed to healthier individuals due to their side effects, but on the other hand may also be prescribed for early symptoms of severe COVID-19.\nConclusions\nUse of NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or renal replacement therapy in

treated in hospital.\n\n We aimed to evaluate the adoption of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID-19 in the UK after the RECOVERY trial publication on June 16, 2020, and to identify discrepancies in care.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did an audit of clinical implementation of corticosteroids in a prospective, observational, cohort study in 237 UK acute care hospitals between March 16, 2020, and April 14, 2021, restricted to patients aged 18 years or older with proven or high likelihood of COVID-19, who received supplementary oxygen.\n\n The primary outcome was administration of dexamethasone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or methylprednisolone.\n\n This study is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN66726260.\nFindings\nBetween June 17, 2020, and April 14, 2021, 47?795 (75·2%) of 63?525 of patients on supplementary oxygen received corticosteroids, higher among patients requiring critical care than in those who received ward care (11?185 [86·6%] of 12?909 vs 36?415 [72·4%] of 50?278).\n\n Patients 50 years or older were significantly less likely to receive corticosteroids than those younger than 50 years (adjusted odds ratio 0·79 [95% CI 0·70–0·89], p=0·0001, for 70–79 years; 0·52 [0·46–0·58], p&lt;0·0001, for &gt;80 years), independent of patient demographics and illness severity.\n\n 84 (54·2%) of 155 pregnant women received corticosteroids.\n\n Rates of corticosteroid administration increased from 27·5% in the week before June 16, 2020, to 75–80% in January, 2021.\nInterpretation\nImplementation of corticosteroids into clinical practice in the UK for patients with COVID-19 has been successful, but not universal.\n\n Patients older than 70 years, independent of illness severity, chronic neurological disease, and dementia, were less likely to receive corticosteroids than those who were younger, as were pregnant women.\n\n This could reflect appropriate clinical decision making, but the possibility of inequitable access to life-saving care should be considered.\n\n\nFunding\nUK National Institute for Health Research and UK Medical Research

Strategies include extending prescription lengths, telemedicine and encouraging vaccination.\n\n However, these need to be accelerated to prevent increased morbidity and mortality.\n\n\nConclusion\nThere are multiple activities across Africa to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and address misinformation, which can have catastrophic consequences, assisted by the WHO and others, which appear to be working in a number of countries.\n\n Research is ongoing to clarify the unintended consequences given ongoing concerns to guide future activities.\n\n Countries are learning from each other.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7533592","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Olayinka O.","surname":"Ogunleye","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Debashis","surname":"Basu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Debjani","surname":"Mueller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jacqueline","surname":"Sneddon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R.

Fibrosis in COVID-19 Survivors: Predictive Factors and Risk Reduction Strategies","abstract":"Although pulmonary fibrosis can occur in the absence of a clear-cut inciting agent, and without a clinically clear initial acute inflammatory phase, it is more commonly associated with severe lung injury.\n This may be due to respiratory infections, chronic granulomatous diseases, medications, and connective tissue disorders.\n Pulmonary fibrosis is associated with permanent pulmonary architectural distortion and irreversible lung dysfunction.\n Available clinical, radiographic, and autopsy data has indicated that pulmonary fibrosis is central to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and MERS pathology, and current evidence suggests that pulmonary fibrosis could also complicate infection by SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to explore the current literature on the pathogenesis of lung injury in COVID-19 infection.\n We evaluate the evidence in support of the putative risk factors for the development of lung fibrosis in the disease and propose risk mitigation strategies.\n We conclude that, from the available literature, the predictors of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 infection are advanced age, illness severity, length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation, smoking and chronic alcoholism.\n With no proven effective targeted therapy against pulmonary fibrosis, risk reduction measures should be directed at limiting the severity of the disease and protecting the lungs from other incidental injuries.\n","id":"PMC7439160","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ademola S.","surname":"Ojo","email":"aojo1@sgu.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simon A.","surname":"Balogun","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Simon A.","surname":"Balogun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Oyeronke T.","surname":"Williams","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olusegun S.","surname":"Ojo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s12916-020-01682-y","date":"2020-06-25","title":"Could hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis be the core issue of severe COVID-19 cases?","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>COVID-19, a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), commonly presents as fever, cough, dyspnea, and myalgia or fatigue.\n\n Although the majority of patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, some are more prone to serious outcomes, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death.\n\n Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe, life-threatening inflammatory syndrome associated with intense cytokine release (also known as a “cytokine storm”).\n\n Similar to COVID-19, HLH is characterized by aggressive course leading to multi-organ failure.\n\n\nMain text\nid='Par2'>The purpose of this review article is to draw attention to the possibility of the complication of HLH in patients with the severe course of COVID-19.

difference in risk of COVID-19 related death associated with current use (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.14) in the multivariable-adjusted model.\n\n In study 2, we included 1 708 781 people with rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis, of whom 175 495 (10%) were current NSAID users.\n\n In the multivariable-adjusted model, we observed a lower risk of COVID-19 related death (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.94) associated with current use of NSAID versus non-use.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe found no evidence of a harmful effect of routinely prescribed NSAIDs on COVID-19 related deaths.\n\n Risks of COVID-19 do not need to influence decisions about the routine therapeutic use of NSAIDs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7823433","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Angel

two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold.\n The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be.\n The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.\n HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well.\n Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic.\n The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.\n Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.\n Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans.\n In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.\n Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.\n The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.\n In addition, the requirements for

grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed.\n This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk.\n Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections.\n Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines.\n Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not.\n Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration.\n To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d.\n The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40–60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L).\n For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful.\n Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.\n","id":"PMC7231123","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"William

Healthy Individuals: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","abstract":"Objective\nVitamin D supplementation may be a simple preventive measure against respiratory tract infections (RTIs) but evidence from randomized controlled trials is inconclusive.\n\n We aimed to systematically summarize results from interventions studying the protective effect of vitamin D supplementation on clinical and laboratory confirmed RTIs in healthy adults and children.\n\n\nMethods\nMedline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL were screened from inception until present (last updated in January 2016) completed by a search of the grey literature, clinical trial registers and conference abstracts.\n\n We included randomized trials comparing vitamin D versus placebo or no treatment.\n\n Two independent reviewers were responsible for study selection and data extraction.\n\n Cochrane’s risk of bias tool and the GRADE approach were used for quality assessment.\n\n Estimates were pooled with random-effects models.\n\n Heterogeneity was explored by sub-group and meta-regression analyses.\n\n\nResults\nOf 2627 original hits, 15 trials including 7053 individuals were ultimately eligible.\n\n All used oral cholecalciferol.\n\n We found a 6% risk reduction with vitamin D3 supplementation on clinical RTIs, but the result was not statistically significant (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00).\n\n Heterogeneity was large (I-square 57%) and overall study quality was low.\n\n There were too few studies to reliably assess a potential risk reduction of laboratory confirmed RTI.\n\n Evidence was insufficient to demonstrate an association between vitamin D supplementation and risk of clinical RTI in sub-groups with vitamin D deficiency.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn previously healthy individuals vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the risk of clinical RTIs.\n\n However, this conclusion is based on a meta-analysis where the included studies differed with respect to population, baseline vitamin D levels and study length.\n\n This needs to be considered when interpreting the results.\n\n Future trials should focus on vitamin D deficient individuals and apply more objective and standardized outcome measurements.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5025082","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Danielle","surname":"Vuichard

Healthy Individuals: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","abstract":"Objective\nVitamin D supplementation may be a simple preventive measure against respiratory tract infections (RTIs) but evidence from randomized controlled trials is inconclusive.\n\n We aimed to systematically summarize results from interventions studying the protective effect of vitamin D supplementation on clinical and laboratory confirmed RTIs in healthy adults and children.\n\n\nMethods\nMedline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL were screened from inception until present (last updated in January 2016) completed by a search of the grey literature, clinical trial registers and conference abstracts.\n\n We included randomized trials comparing vitamin D versus placebo or no treatment.\n\n Two independent reviewers were responsible for study selection and data extraction.\n\n Cochrane’s risk of bias tool and the GRADE approach were used for quality assessment.\n\n Estimates were pooled with random-effects models.\n\n Heterogeneity was explored by sub-group and meta-regression analyses.\n\n\nResults\nOf 2627 original hits, 15 trials including 7053 individuals were ultimately eligible.\n\n All used oral cholecalciferol.\n\n We found a 6% risk reduction with vitamin D3 supplementation on clinical RTIs, but the result was not statistically significant (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00).\n\n Heterogeneity was large (I-square 57%) and overall study quality was low.\n\n There were too few studies to reliably assess a potential risk reduction of laboratory confirmed RTI.\n\n Evidence was insufficient to demonstrate an association between vitamin D supplementation and risk of clinical RTI in sub-groups with vitamin D deficiency.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn previously healthy individuals vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the risk of clinical RTIs.\n\n However, this conclusion is based on a meta-analysis where the included studies differed with respect to population, baseline vitamin D levels and study length.\n\n This needs to be considered when interpreting the results.\n\n Future trials should focus on vitamin D deficient individuals and apply more objective and standardized outcome measurements.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5025082","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Danielle","surname":"Vuichard

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected at baseline.\n\n Plasma samples were analysed for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFR1) using a novel point-of-care assay.\n\n A parsimonious regression classifier model was used to calculate the probability for the hyperinflammatory phenotype in COVID-19 using IL-6, soluble TNFR1, and bicarbonate levels.\n\n Data from this cohort was compared with patients with ARDS due to causes other than COVID-19 recruited to a previous UK multicentre, randomised controlled trial of simvastatin (HARP-2).\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 17 and April 25, 2020, 39 patients were recruited to the study.\n\n Median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (PaO2/FiO2) was 18 kpa (IQR 15–21) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 12 (10–16).\n\n 17 (44%) of 39 patients had died by day 28 of the study.\n\n Compared with survivors, patients who died were older and had lower PaO2/FiO2.\n\n The median probability for the hyperinflammatory phenotype was 0·03 (IQR 0·01–0·2).\n\n Depending on the probability cutoff used to assign class, the prevalence of the hyperinflammatory phenotype was between four (10%) and eight (21%) of 39, which is lower than the proportion of patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype in HARP-2 (186 [35%] of 539).\n\n Using the Youden index cutoff (0·274) to classify phenotype, five (63%) of eight patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype and 12 (39%) of 31 with the hypoinflammatory phenotype died.\n\n Compared with matched patients recruited to HARP-2, levels of IL-6 were similar in our cohort, whereas soluble TNFR1 was significantly lower in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn this exploratory analysis of 39 patients, ARDS due to COVID-19 was not associated with higher systemic inflammation and was associated with a lower prevalence of the hyperinflammatory phenotype than that observed in historical ARDS data.\n\n This finding suggests that the excess mortality observed in COVID-19-related ARDS is unlikely to be due to the upregulation of inflammatory pathways described by the parsimonious model.\n\n\nFunding\nUS National Institutes of Health, Innovate UK, and

25-hydroxyvitamin D levels among healthy children aged 3-36 months in a setting where vitamin D prophylaxis is a national policy for infants during the first year of life and among pregnant women.\n\n\nMethods:\nA total of 190 healthy children with a mean age of 15.9 ± 10.4 months were prospectively enrolled.\n\n\nResults:\nThe mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of children was 38.1 ± 16.2

that Vitamin D Supplementation Could Reduce Risk of Influenza and COVID-19 Infections and Deaths","abstract":"The world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed.\n This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk.\n Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections.\n Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines.\n Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not.\n Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration.\n To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d.\n The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40–60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L).\n For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful.\n Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.\n","id":"PMC7231123","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"William

calcium homeostasis, and a concentration between 20 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL is considered adequate to provide an immunomodulatory effect.\n\n Available data support a role for vitamin D deficiency in the risk of pediatric tuberculosis, recurrent acute otitis media, and severe bronchiolitis, whereas further studies are needed to confirm an association in children with recurrent pharyngotonsillitis, acute rhinosinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia.\n\n\nConclusions\nMaintenance of adequate vitamin D status may be an effective and inexpensive prophylactic method against some RTIs, but the supplementation regimen has not been clearly defined.\n\n Further clinical trials are needed to determine the 25(OH)D concentrations associated with an increased risk of RTIs and optimal vitamin D supplementation regimen according to the type of RTI while also taking into consideration vitamin D receptor polymorphisms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4628332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Susanna","surname":"Esposito","email":"susanna.esposito@unimi.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mara","surname":"Lelii","email":"mara.lelii87@gmail.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3310/hta23020","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Vitamin

myalgia is a major and common cause of statin intolerance.\n\n Low serum vitamin D and statins, additively or synergistically, cause myalgia, myositis, myopathy, and/or myonecrosis.\n\n Statin-induced myalgia in vitamin D deficient patients can often be resolved by vitamin D supplementation, normalizing serum vitamin D levels.\n\n\nAims:\nIn 74 men and 72 women (age 59 ± 14 years) intolerant to ?2 statins because of myalgia, myositis, myopathy, or myonecrosis and found to have low (&lt;32 ng/mL) serum vitamin D, we prospectively assessed whether vitamin D supplementation (vitamin D2: 50,000-100,000 units/week) to normalize serum vitamin D would allow successful rechallenge therapy with statins.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nFollow-up evaluation on vitamin D supplementation was done on 134 patients at 6 months (median 5.3), 103 patients at 12 months (median 12.2), and 82 patients at 24 months (median 24).\n\n\nResults:\nMedian entry serum vitamin D (22 ng/mL, 23 ng/mL, and 23 ng/mL) rose at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months follow-up to 53 ng/mL, 53 ng/mL, and 55 ng/mL, respectively, (P &lt; .\n\n0001 for all) on vitamin D therapy (50,000-100,000 units/week).\n\n On vitamin D supplementation, serum vitamin D normalized at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months follow-up in 90%, 86%, and 91% of the patients, respectively.\n\n On rechallenge with statins while on vitamin D supplementation, median low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) fell from the study entry (167 mg/dL, 164 mg/dL, and 158 mg/dL) to 90 mg/dL, 91 mg/dL, and 84 mg/dL, respectively, (P &lt;

myalgia, myositis, myopathy, and/or myonecrosis.\n\n\nConclusions:\nStatin intolerance because of myalgia, myositis, myopathy, or myonecrosis associated with low serum vitamin D can be safely resolved by vitamin D supplementation (50,000-100,000 units /week) in most cases

vitamin D could be acknowledged as a “seasonal stimulus”, as defined by R.\n Edgar Hope-Simpson, it would be crucial to prove it from a potential easy and cheap prophylaxis or therapy support perspective as far as influenza infections are concerned.\n The survey of the literature data generates some controversies and doubts about the possible role of vitamin D in the prevention of influenza virus.\n The most important point is to realise that the broad spectrum of this vitamin’s activity does not exclude such a possibility.\n According to most of the authors, more randomized controlled trials with effective, large populations are needed to explore the preventive effect of vitamin D supplementation on viral influenza infections.\n","id":"PMC6121423","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Beata M.","surname":"Gruber-Bzura","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth

angiotensin II-exposed microglial cells: Role of renin-angiotensin system","abstract":"Hypertension is one of the major predisposing factors for neurodegenerative disease characterized with activated renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in both periphery and brain.\n Vitamin D (VitD) is recently recognized as a pleiotropic hormone with strong neuroprotective properties.\n While multiple lines of evidence suggest that VitD can act on RAS, the evidence concerning the crosstalk between VitD and RAS in the brain is limited.\n Therefore, this study aims to evaluate whether VitD can modulate brain RAS to trigger neuroprotective actions in the brain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).\n Our data showed that calcitriol treatment induced VDR expression and inhibited neural death in the prefrontal cortex of SHR.\n Sustained calcitriol administration also inhibited microglia M1 polarization, but enhanced M2 polarization, accompanied with decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines.\n We then further explored the potential mechanisms and showed that SHR exhibited overactivated classical RAS with increased expression of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor type 1 (AT1), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II production, whereas the counteracting arm of traditional RAS, ACE2/Ang(1–7)/MasR, was impaired in the SHR brain.\n Calcitriol nonsignificantly suppressed AT1 and ACE but markedly reduced Ang II formation.\n Intriguingly, calcitriol exerted pronouncedly impact on ACE2/Ang(1–7)/MasR axis with enhanced expression of ACE2, MasR and Ang(1–7) generation.\n Meanwhile, calcitriol ameliorated the overactivation of NADPH-oxidase (Nox), the downstream of RAS, in SHR, and also mitigated oxidative stress.\n In microglial (BV2) cells, we further found that calcitriol induced ACE2 and MasR with no significant impact on ACE and AT1. In accordance, calcitriol also attenuated Ang II-induced Nox activation and ROS production, and shifted the microglia polarization from M1 to M2 phenotype.\n However, co-treatment with A779, a specific MasR antagonist, abrogated the antioxidant and neuroimmune modulating actions of VitD.\n These findings strongly indicate the involvement of ACE2/Ang(1–7)/MasR pathway in the neuroprotective mechanisms of VitD in the hypertensive brain.\n","id":"PMC6831892","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Changmeng","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pengfei","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gongying","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Qiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wenxiu","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chunmei","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dehua","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mengqi","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pei","surname":"Jiang","email":"jiangpeicsu@sina.com","contributions":"1"}],"References

renin-angiotensin system: going beyond the classical paradigms","abstract":"Thirty years ago, a novel axis of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was unveiled by the discovery of angiotensin-(1?7) [ANG-(1?7)] generation in vivo.\n Later, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was shown to be the main mediator of this reaction, and Mas was found to be the receptor for the heptapeptide.\n The functional analysis of this novel axis of the RAS that followed its discovery revealed numerous protective actions in particular for cardiovascular diseases.\n In parallel, similar protective actions were also described for one of the two receptors of ANG II, the ANG II type 2 receptor (AT2R), in contrast to the other, the ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R), which mediates deleterious actions of this peptide, e.\ng.\n, in the setting of cardiovascular disease.\n Very recently, another branch of the RAS was discovered, based on angiotensin peptides in which the amino-terminal aspartate was replaced by alanine, the alatensins.\n Ala-ANG-(1?7) or alamandine was shown to interact with Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor D, and the first functional data indicated that this peptide also exerts protective effects in the cardiovascular system.\n This review summarizes the presentations given at the International Union of Physiological Sciences Congress in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2017, during the symposium entitled “The Renin-Angiotensin System: Going Beyond the Classical Paradigms,” in which the signaling and physiological actions of ANG-(1?7), ACE2, AT2R, and alatensins were reported (with a focus on noncentral nervous system-related tissues) and the therapeutic opportunities based on these findings were discussed.\n","id":"PMC7191626","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Robson Augusto

disability-adjusted life years, and years lived with disability for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015","abstract":"Background\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are common diseases with a heterogeneous distribution worldwide.\n\n Here, we present methods and disease and risk estimates for COPD and asthma from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 2015 study.\n\n The GBD study provides annual updates on estimates of deaths, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a summary measure of fatal and non-fatal disease outcomes, for over 300 diseases and injuries, for 188 countries from 1990 to the most recent year.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated numbers of deaths due to COPD and asthma using the GBD Cause of Death Ensemble modelling (CODEm) tool.\n\n First, we analysed data from vital registration and verbal autopsy for the aggregate category of all chronic respiratory diseases.\n\n Subsequently, models were run for asthma and COPD relying on covariates to predict rates in countries that have incomplete or no vital registration data.\n\n Disease estimates for COPD and asthma were based on systematic reviews of published papers, unpublished reports, surveys, and health service encounter data from the USA.\n\n We used the Global Initiative of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease spirometry-based definition as the reference for COPD and a reported diagnosis of asthma with current wheeze as the definition of asthma.\n\n We used a Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, to derive estimates of prevalence and incidence.\n\n We estimated population-attributable fractions for risk factors for COPD and asthma from exposure data, relative risks, and a theoretical minimum exposure level.\n\n Results were stratified by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure of income per capita, mean years of education over the age of 15 years, and total fertility rate.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2015, 3·2 million people (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1 million to 3·3 million) died from COPD worldwide, an increase of 11·6% (95% UI 5·3 to 19·8) compared with 1990. There was a decrease in age-standardised death rate of 41·9% (37·7 to 45·1) but this was counteracted by population growth and ageing of the global population.\n\n From 1990 to 2015, the prevalence of COPD increased by 44·2% (41·7 to 46·6), whereas age-standardised prevalence decreased by 14·7% (13·5 to 15·9).\n\n In 2015, 0·40 million people (0·36 million to 0·44 million) died from asthma, a decrease of 26·7% (?7·2 to 43·7) from 1990, and the age-standardised death rate decreased by 58·8% (39·0 to 69·0).\n\n The prevalence of asthma increased by 12·6% (9·0 to 16·4), whereas the age-standardised prevalence decreased by 17·7% (15·1 to 19·9).\n\n Age-standardised DALY rates due to COPD increased until the middle range of the SDI before reducing sharply.\n\n Age-standardised DALY rates due to asthma in both sexes decreased monotonically with rising SDI.\n\n The relation between with SDI and DALY rates due to asthma was attributed to variation in years of life lost (YLLs), whereas DALY rates due to COPD varied similarly for YLLs and years lived with disability across the SDI continuum.\n\n Smoking and ambient particulate matter were the main risk factors for COPD followed by household air pollution, occupational particulates, ozone, and secondhand smoke.\n\n Together, these risks explained 73·3% (95% UI 65·8 to 80·1) of DALYs due to COPD.\n\n Smoking and occupational asthmagens were the only risks quantified for asthma in GBD, accounting for 16·5% (14·6 to 18·7) of DALYs due to asthma.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAsthma was the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide in 2015, with twice the number of cases of COPD.\n\n Deaths from COPD were eight times more common than deaths from asthma.\n\n In 2015, COPD caused 2·6% of global DALYs and asthma 1·1% of global DALYs.\n\n Although there are laudable international collaborative efforts to make surveys of asthma and COPD more comparable, no consensus exists on case definitions and how to measure disease severity for population health measurements like GBD.\n\n Comparisons between countries and over time are important, as much of the chronic respiratory burden is either preventable or treatable with affordable interventions.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5573769","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joan

COPD through suppression of type I interferon","abstract":"Background\nThe mechanisms underlying altered susceptibility and propensity to severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease in at-risk groups such as patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are poorly understood.\n\n Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are widely used in COPD, but the extent to which these therapies protect or expose patients to risk of severe COVID-19 is unknown.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ICSs following pulmonary expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2).\n\n\nMethods\nWe evaluated the effect of ICS administration on pulmonary ACE2 expression in vitro in human airway epithelial cell cultures and in vivo in mouse models of ICS administration.\n\n Mice deficient in the type I IFN-?/? receptor (Ifnar1?/?) and administration of exogenous IFN-? were used to study the functional role of type-I interferon signaling in ACE2 expression.\n\n We compared sputum ACE2 expression in patients with COPD stratified according to use or nonuse of ICS.\n\n\nResults\nICS administration attenuated ACE2 expression in mice, an effect that was reversed by exogenous IFN-? administration, and Ifnar1?/? mice had reduced ACE2 expression, indicating that type I interferon contributes mechanistically to this effect.\n\n ICS administration attenuated expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cell cultures from patients with COPD and in mice with elastase-induced COPD-like changes.\n\n Compared with ICS nonusers, patients with COPD who were taking ICSs also had reduced sputum expression of ACE2.\n\n\nConclusion\nICS therapies in COPD reduce expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2. This effect may thus contribute to altered susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with COPD.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7558236","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lydia

lived with disability for 328 diseases and injuries for 195 countries, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016","abstract":"Background\nAs mortality rates decline, life expectancy increases, and populations age, non-fatal outcomes of diseases and injuries are becoming a larger component of the global burden of disease.\n\n The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016.\nMethods\nWe estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences.\n\n We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition.\n\n For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data.\n\n YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level.\n\n We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate.\n\n GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).\n\n\nFindings\nGlobally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57·6 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 40·8–75·9 million [7·2%, 6·0–8·3]), 45·1 million (29·0–62·8 million [5·6%, 4·0–7·2]), 36·3 million (25·3–50·9 million [4·5%, 3·8–5·3]), 34·7 million (23·0–49·6 million [4·3%, 3·5–5·2]), and 34·1 million (23·5–46·0 million [4·2%, 3·2–5·3]) of total YLDs, respectively.\n\n Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2·7% (95% UI 2·3–3·1).\n\n Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations.\n\n The largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years.\n\n Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined were 10·4% (95% UI 9·0–11·8) higher in women than in men.\n\n Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women.\n\n Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence.\n\n Globally, we noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality.\n\n In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100?000, 95% UI 6862–11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14?774 YLDs per 100?000, 11?018–19?228).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates.\n\n For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, such as diabetes.\n\n As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults.\n\n Up-to-date information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate health-system response.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of

risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease.\n\n It has been suggested that asthma and allergy are not highly represented as comorbid conditions associated with COVID-19.\nObjective\nOur aim was to extend our work in IL-13 biology to determine whether airway epithelial cell expression of 2 key mediators critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, namely, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), are modulated by IL-13.\nMethods\nWe determined effects of IL-13 treatment on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in primary airway epithelial cells from participants with and without type 2 asthma obtained by bronchoscopy.\n\n We also examined expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in 2 data sets containing gene expression data from nasal and airway epithelial cells from children and adults with asthma and allergic rhinitis.\n\n\nResults\nIL-13 significantly reduced ACE2 and increased TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in airway epithelial cells.\n\n In 2 independent data sets, ACE2 expression was significantly reduced and TMPRSS2 expression was significantly increased in the nasal and airway epithelial cells in type 2 asthma and allergic rhinitis.\n\n ACE2 expression was significantly negatively associated with type 2 cytokines, whereas TMPRSS2 expression was significantly positively associated with type 2 cytokines.\n\n\nConclusion\nIL-13 modulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in airway epithelial cells in asthma and atopy.\n\n This deserves further study with regard to any effects that asthma and atopy may render in the setting of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7227558","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hiroki","surname":"Kimura","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dave","surname":"Francisco","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"Conway","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fernando

mortality rate, underscoring the need for a better transfer of novel scientific knowledge into healthcare interventions.\n Herein, we review recent findings in pathology (with the questioning of the strict morphological categorisation of various forms of PH into pre- or post-capillary involvement of pulmonary vessels) and cellular mechanisms contributing to the onset and progression of pulmonary vascular remodelling associated with various forms of PH.\n We also discuss ways to improve management and to support and optimise drug development in this research

inhibitor alone group (group B); cigarette\ninduction group (group C); cigarette induction + inhibitor group (group D).\n\n\nAfter the establishment of smoking-induced PAH rat model, the right\nventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was detected using an inserted\ncatheter; western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of\nangiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme\n(ACE); expression levels of angiotensin II (AngII) in lung tissue were\nmeasured by radioimmunoassay.\n\n\nResults:\nAfter six months of cigarette exposure, the RVSP of chronic cigarette\ninduction group was significantly higher than that of the control group;\nexpression levels of AngII and ACE increased in lung tissues, but ACE2\nexpression levels reduced.\n\n Compared with cigarette exposure group, after\nlosartan treatment, RVSP, ACE and AngII obviously decreased\n(P&lt;0.05), and ACE2 expression levels significantly\nincreased.\n\n\nConclusion:\nChronic

with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.00127-20","date":"2020-01-28","title":"Receptor Recognition by the Novel Coronavirus from Wuhan: an Analysis Based on Decade-Long Structural Studies of SARS Coronavirus","abstract":"The recent emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert.\n 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.\n One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses.\n Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV.\n This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.\n","id":"PMC7081895","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yushun","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rachel","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Gallagher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Gallagher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.yexmp.2019.104350","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ACE2 exhibits protective effects against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice by inhibiting the LPS-TLR4 pathway","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.genrep.2021.101077","date":"2021-02-26","title":"ACE2: At the crossroad of COVID-19 and lung cancer","abstract":"Upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) was frequently observed in patients with lung cancer.\n Interestingly, our recent study revealed that the same ACE2 receptor was also strongly upregulated in lungs during SARS-CoV2 infection.\n Therefore, it is possible that the upregulated expression of ACE2 in lung tumors might increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection in lung cancer patients.\n However, the molecular mechanism for the regulation of ACE2 is known neither in lung tumors nor in COVID-19.

H5N1","abstract":"Background\nQinghai Lake in central China has been at the center of debate on whether wild birds play a role in circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. In 2005, an unprecedented epizootic at Qinghai Lake killed more than 6000 migratory birds including over 3000 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus).\n\n H5N1 subsequently spread to Europe and Africa, and in following years has re-emerged in wild birds along the Central Asia flyway several times.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nTo better understand the potential involvement of wild birds in the spread of H5N1, we studied the movements of bar-headed geese marked with GPS satellite transmitters at Qinghai Lake in relation to virus outbreaks and disease risk factors.\n\n We discovered a previously undocumented migratory pathway between Qinghai Lake and the Lhasa Valley of Tibet where 93% of the 29 marked geese overwintered.\n\n From 2003–2009, sixteen outbreaks in poultry or wild birds were confirmed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the majority were located within the migratory pathway of the geese.\n\n Spatial and temporal concordance between goose movements and three potential H5N1 virus sources (poultry farms, a captive bar-headed goose facility, and H5N1 outbreak locations) indicated ample opportunities existed for virus spillover and infection of migratory geese on the wintering grounds.\n\n Their potential as a vector of H5N1 was supported by rapid migration movements of some geese and genetic relatedness of H5N1 virus isolated from geese in Tibet and Qinghai Lake.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThis is the first study to compare phylogenetics of the virus with spatial ecology of its host, and the combined results suggest that wild birds play a role in the spread of H5N1 in this region.\n\n However, the strength of the evidence would be improved with additional sequences from both poultry and wild birds on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where H5N1 has a clear stronghold.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3052365","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Diann

Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1): Pathways of Exposure at the Animal?Human Interface, a Systematic Review","abstract":"Background\nThe threat posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses to humans remains significant, given the continued occurrence of sporadic human cases (499 human cases in 15 countries) with a high case fatality rate (approximately 60%), the endemicity in poultry populations in several countries, and the potential for reassortment with the newly emerging 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain.\n\n Therefore, we review risk factors for H5N1 infection in humans.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nSeveral epidemiologic studies have evaluated the risk factors associated with increased risk of H5N1 infection among humans who were exposed to H5N1 viruses.\n\n Our review shows that most H5N1 cases are attributed to exposure to sick poultry.\n\n Most cases are sporadic, while occasional limited human-to-human transmission occurs.\n\n The most commonly identified factors associated with H5N1 virus infection included exposure through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids of infected poultry via food preparation practices; touching and caring for infected poultry; consuming uncooked poultry products; exposure to H5N1 via swimming or bathing in potentially virus laden ponds; and exposure to H5N1 at live bird markets.\n\n\nConclusions\nResearch has demonstrated that despite frequent and widespread contact with poultry, transmission of the H5N1 virus from poultry to humans is rare.\n\n Available research has identified several risk factors that may be associated with infection including close direct contact with poultry and transmission via the environment.\n\n However, several important data gaps remain that limit our understanding of the epidemiology of H5N1 in humans.\n\n Although infection in humans with H5N1 remains rare, human cases continue to be reported and H5N1 is now considered endemic among poultry in parts of Asia and in Egypt, providing opportunities for additional human infections and for the acquisition of virus mutations that may lead to more efficient spread among humans and other mammalian species.\n\n Collaboration between human and animal health sectors for surveillance, case investigation, virus sharing, and risk assessment is essential to monitor for potential changes in circulating H5N1 viruses and in the epidemiology of H5N1 in order to provide the best possible chance for effective mitigation of the impact of H5N1 in both poultry and humans.\n\n\nDisclaimer\nThe opinions expressed in this

influenza A virus into a resistant strain.\n Currently, Oseltamivir is being stockpiled in many countries potentially affected by the influenza A virus subtype H5N1 epidemic.\n To identify this change in Oseltamivir-treated patients, a method based on real-time PCR using two labeled TaqMan probes was developed for its rapid detection.\n In order to validate the method, Oseltamivir specimen from treated (Oseltamivir-resistant strain from a Vietnamese patient, two Oseltamivir-treated tigers) and untreated subjects have been used for this study.\n The results thus obtained as well as those derived from clone selection and sequencing showed that TaqMan probes could clearly discriminate wild type H274 from the mutant 274Y variant.\n The sensitivity of this assay was as low as 10 copies/?l and allowed the detection of the mutation in a mixture of wild type and mutant.\n Overall, the assay based on real-time PCR with two labeled TaqMan probes described here should be useful for detecting Oseltamivir-resistant H274Y H5N1 influenza A virus in many species and various sources of specimens with high sensitivity and specificity.\n Such studies can address potential differences in the diagnostic outcomes between patients who develop detectable Oseltamivir resistance and those who retain only the wild type strain of

finally produced from Ang I or Ang II by the catalytic activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n Ang-(1–7) shows actions different from those of AT1 receptor stimulation, such as vasodilatation, natriuresis, anti-proliferation and an increase in the bradykinin–NO (nitric oxide) system.\n As the catalytic efficiency of ACE2 is approximately 400-fold higher with Ang II as a substrate than with Ang I, this axis is possibly acting as a counter-regulatory system against the ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor axis.\n The signaling pathway of the ACE2–Ang-(1–7) axis has not yet been

such as Akt phosphorylation, protein kinase C activation and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibition seem to be involved in this signaling pathway.\n Further investigations are needed to

high, but whether persons with ARDS are more susceptible to pneumonia or simply have more risk factors remains unknown because of methodological limitations.\n Recent research suggests that host factors have a major bearing on the development of ARDS.\n To date, sepsis seems to be the principal link between pneumonia and ARDS.\n However, prospective observational data on this supposed sequence are not available.\n The individual role of specific pathogens for the development of ARDS is difficult to assess, because prospective studies are missing.\n Respiratory viruses have received particular attention, but this review suggests that infections with coronavirus and avian influenza virus (H5N1) are associated with a high incidence of ARDS.\n","id":"PMC7107989","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Torsten

Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection in China","abstract":"Background\nWhile human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection continue to increase globally, available clinical data on H5N1 cases are limited.\n\n We conducted a retrospective study of 26 confirmed human H5N1 cases identified through surveillance in China from October 2005 through April 2008.\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nData were collected from hospital medical records of H5N1 cases and analyzed.\n\n The median age was 29 years (range 6–62) and 58% were female.\n\n Many H5N1 cases reported fever (92%) and cough (58%) at illness onset, and had lower respiratory findings of tachypnea and dyspnea at admission.\n\n All cases progressed rapidly to bilateral pneumonia.\n\n Clinical complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 81%), cardiac failure (50%), elevated aminotransaminases (43%), and renal dysfunction (17%).\n\n Fatal cases had a lower median nadir platelet count (64.5×109 cells/L vs 93.0×109 cells/L, p?=?0.02), higher median peak lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level (1982.5 U/L vs 1230.0 U/L, p?=?0.001), higher percentage of ARDS (94% [n?=?16] vs 56% [n?=?5], p?=?0.034) and more frequent cardiac failure (71% [n?=?12] vs 11% [n?=?1], p?=?0.011) than nonfatal cases.\n\n A higher proportion of patients who received antiviral drugs survived compared to untreated (67% [8/12] vs 7% [1/14], p?=?0.003).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThe clinical course of Chinese H5N1 cases is characterized by fever and cough initially, with rapid progression to lower respiratory disease.\n\n Decreased platelet count, elevated LDH level, ARDS and cardiac failure were associated with fatal outcomes.\n\n Clinical management of H5N1 cases should be standardized in China to include early antiviral treatment for suspected H5N1 cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2515635","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hongjie","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuelong","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Huai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luzhao","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhibin","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhongjie","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cuiling","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junhua","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chengping","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoling","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuecheng","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zigui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Longshan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yusheng","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huiming","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liping","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xianfeng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianbao","surname":"Xin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junqiao","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qiuyue","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhengan","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Longnv","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kunzhao","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinye","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoning","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shichang","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lanjuan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinquan","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erdang","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pingping","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shui

leads to an increase in the chest wall elastance.\n At a given applied airway pressure, the pleural pressure increases according to (in the static condition) the equation: pleural pressure = airway pressure × (chest wall elastance/total respiratory system elastance).\n Consequently, for a given applied pressure, the increase in pleural pressure implies a decrease in transpulmonary pressure (airway pressure – pleural pressure), which is the distending force of the lung, implies a decrease of the strain and of ventilator-induced lung injury, implies the need to use a higher airway pressure during the recruitment maneuvers to reach a sufficient transpulmonary opening pressure, implies hemodynamic risk due to the reductions in venous return and heart size, and implies a possible increase of lung edema, partially due to the reduced edema clearance.\n It is always important in the most critically ill patients to assess the intra-abdominal pressure and the chest wall
