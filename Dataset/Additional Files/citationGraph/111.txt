the first two National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, carried out in 1990–1991 (Natsal-1) and 1999–2001 (Natsal-2), have been extensively used to inform sexual health policy in Britain over the past two decades.\n\n Natsal-3 was carried out from September 2010 to August 2012 in order to provide up-to-date measures of sexual lifestyles and to extend the scope of the previous studies by including an older age group (up to 74?years), an extended range of topics and biological measures.\n\n\nMethods\nWe describe the methods used in Natsal-3, which surveyed the general population in Britain aged 16–74?years (with oversampling of younger adults aged 16–34?years).\n\n\nResults\nOverall, 15?162 interviews were completed, with a response rate of 57.7% and a cooperation rate of 65.8%.\n\n The response rate for the boost sample of ages 16–34?years was 64.8%, only marginally lower than the 65.4% achieved for Natsal-2, which surveyed a similar age range (16–44).\n\n The data were weighted by age, gender and region to reduce possible bias.\n\n Comparisons with census data show the weighted sample to provide good representation on a range of respondent characteristics.\n\n The interview involved a combination of face-to-face and self-completion components, both carried out on computer.\n\n Urine samples from 4550 sexually-experienced participants aged 16–44?years were tested for a range of STIs.\n\n Saliva samples from 4128 participants aged 18–74?years were tested for testosterone.\n\n\nConclusions\nNatsal-3 provides a high quality dataset that can be used to examine trends in sexual attitudes and behaviours over the past 20?years.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3933071","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Bob","surname":"Erens","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Phelps","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Soazig","surname":"Clifton","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Catherine

Odds ratios (ORs) were used to express differences between the benchmark data and each survey for each variable of interest.\n\n A summary measure of survey performance was the average absolute OR across variables.\n\n Another summary measure was the number of key estimates for which the survey differed significantly (at the 5% level) from the benchmarks.\n\n\nResults\nFor sociodemographic variables, the Web surveys were less representative of the general population than Natsal-3. For example, for men, the average absolute OR for Natsal-3 was 1.14, whereas for the Web surveys the average absolute ORs ranged from 1.86 to 2.30. For all Web surveys, approximately two-thirds of the key estimates of sexual behaviors were different from Natsal-3 and the average absolute ORs ranged from 1.32 to 1.98. Differences were appreciable even for questions asked by CASI in Natsal-3.

touchscreen device in the older adult population is lacking.\n\n\nObjective\nThe objective of this study was to compare the use of tablet computer-delivered and printed questionnaires as vehicles for the collection of psychosocial data from older adults to determine whether this digital platform would be readily adopted by the sample, and to identify whether tablet delivery influences the content of data received.\n\n\nMethods\nThe participants completed three questionnaires using both delivery methods, followed by a brief evaluation.\n\n\nResults\nA nonparametric one-sample binomial test indicated a significantly greater proportion of individuals preferred the tablet-delivered questionnaires (z=4.96, SE 3.428, P&lt;.\n\n001).\n\n Paired sample t tests and Wilcoxon sign-rank tests indicated that measures collected by each method were not significantly different (all P?.\n\n273).\n\n Ease of use of the tablet interface and anxiety while completing the digital questionnaires were significantly correlated with preferences, (r\ns=.\n\n665, P&lt;.\n\n001 and r\ns=.\n\n552, P&lt;.\n\n001, respectively).\n\n Participants most frequently reported that the tablet delivery increased speed of use and improved data entry, although navigation was perceived as being more difficult.\n\n By comparison, participants felt that the paper packet was easier to read and navigate, but was slow and cumbersome, and they disliked the lack of dynamic features.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study provides preliminary evidence suggesting that questionnaires delivered to older adults using contemporary tablet computers may be acceptable and do not substantively influence the content of the collected data.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4129113","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Justin","surname":"Dickerson","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Justin","surname":"Dickerson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jutta","surname":"Richter","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jason","surname":"Fanning","email":"fanning4@illinois.edu","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jason","surname":"Fanning","email":"fanning4@illinois.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward","surname":"McAuley","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Edward","surname":"McAuley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/0193841X09340214","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

multiple-choice questions: a descriptive analysis","abstract":"Background\nFour- or five-option multiple choice questions (MCQs) are the standard in health-science disciplines, both on certification-level examinations and on in-house developed tests.\n\n Previous research has shown, however, that few MCQs have three or four functioning distractors.\n\n The purpose of this study was to investigate non-functioning distractors in teacher-developed tests in one nursing program in an English-language university in Hong Kong.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing item-analysis data, we assessed the proportion of non-functioning distractors on a sample of seven test papers administered to undergraduate nursing students.\n\n A total of 514 items were reviewed, including 2056 options (1542 distractors and 514 correct responses).\n\n Non-functioning options were defined as ones that were chosen by fewer than 5% of examinees and those with a positive option discrimination statistic.\n\n\nResults\nThe proportion of items containing 0, 1, 2, and 3 functioning distractors was 12.3%, 34.8%, 39.1%, and 13.8% respectively.\n\n Overall, items contained an average of 1.54 (SD = 0.88) functioning distractors.\n\n Only 52.2% (n = 805) of all distractors were functioning effectively and 10.2% (n = 158) had a choice frequency of 0. Items with more functioning distractors were more difficult and more discriminating.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe low frequency of items with three functioning distractors in the four-option items in this study suggests that teachers have difficulty developing plausible distractors for most MCQs.\n\n Test items should consist of as many options as is feasible given the item content and the number of plausible distractors; in most cases this would be three.\n\n Item analysis results can be used to identify and remove non-functioning distractors from MCQs that have been used in previous tests.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2713226","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marie","surname":"Tarrant","email":"tarrantm@hku.hk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James","surname":"Ware","email":"jamesw@hsc.edu.kw","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ahmed

Disease Sleep Scale-Revised","abstract":"Many studies have sought to describe the relationship between sleep disturbance and cognition in Parkinson’s disease (PD).\n The Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) and its variants (the Parkinson’s disease Sleep Scale-Revised; PDSS-R, and the Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale-2; PDSS-2) quantify a range of symptoms impacting sleep in only 15 items.\n However, data from these scales may be problematic as included items have considerable conceptual breadth, and there may be overlap in the constructs assessed.\n Multidimensional measurement models, accounting for the tendency for items to measure multiple constructs, may be useful more accurately to model variance than traditional confirmatory factor analysis.\n In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that a multidimensional model (a bifactor model) is more appropriate than traditional factor analysis for data generated by these types of scales, using data collected using the PDSS-R as an exemplar.\n 166 participants diagnosed with idiopathic PD participated in this study.\n Using PDSS-R data, we compared three models: a unidimensional model; a 3-factor model consisting of sub-factors measuring insomnia, motor symptoms and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) symptoms; and, a confirmatory bifactor model with both a general factor and the same three sub-factors.\n Only the confirmatory bifactor model achieved satisfactory model fit, suggesting that PDSS-R data are multidimensional.\n There were differential associations between factor scores and patient characteristics, suggesting that some PDSS-R items, but not others, are influenced by mood and personality in addition to sleep symptoms.\n Multidimensional measurement models may also be a helpful tool in the PDSS and the PDSS-2 scales and may improve the sensitivity of these instruments.\n","id":"PMC5809063","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria E.","surname":"Pushpanathan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrea

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"  .

Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population in China","abstract":"Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience.\n Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic.\n The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n The data will be used for future reference.\n Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques.\n The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern","abstract":"","id":"PMC7135038","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"cyh-birm@263.net","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter W","surname":"Horby","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick G","surname":"Hayden","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1007.030703","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS Control and Psychological Effects of Quarantine, Toronto, Canada","abstract":"Explores effects of quarantine on those quarantined for SARS, Toronto, Canada","id":"PMC3323345","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Hawryluck","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wayne L.","surname":"Gold","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Robinson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Pogorski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sandro","surname":"Galea","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rima","surname":"Styra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/jcm9020330","date":"2020-01-23","title":"The Extent of Transmission of Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, 2020","abstract":"A cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported by China in late December 2019.

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers

unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth.\n The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation.\n We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0.\n Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.\n The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403–540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18–25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.\n We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49–2.63).\n Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.\n","id":"PMC7074332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinjun","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guangpu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daozhou","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),

rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died

to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nWhen an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered.\n\n Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities.\n\n The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities.\n At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down.\n It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities.\n Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma.\n The severity of this epidemic and its long-lasting repercussions

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing

Second, are these behavior and mental health changes associated with the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media?\nMethods\nBehaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife smartphone sensing app.\n\n Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students, with 178 (82.0%) students providing data during the Winter 2020 term.\n\n Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term compared to previous terms in the same cohort were modeled using mixed linear models.\n\n\nResults\nDuring the first academic term impacted by COVID-19 (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P&lt;.\n\n001) relative to previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks.\n\n Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and the week of the academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant.\n\n In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term were strongly associated with increased amount of COVID-19–related news.\n\n When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P&lt;.\n\n001) and depression (P=.\n\n03) were significantly associated with COVID-19–related news.\n\n\nConclusions\nCompared with prior academic terms, individuals in the Winter 2020 term were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed.\n\n A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, were associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting.\n\n While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods to reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7301687","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roberto","surname":"Cruz

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth.\n The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation.\n We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0.\n Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.\n The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403–540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18–25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.\n We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49–2.63).\n Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.\n","id":"PMC7074332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinjun","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangpu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daozhou","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nWhen an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered.\n\n Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities.\n\n The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities.\n At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down.\n It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities.\n Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma.\n The severity of this epidemic and its long-lasting repercussions

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire.\n\n Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access.\n\n\nIn addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6).\n\n The total Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n The perceived dangerous Pollutant

Internet in data collection during an air-pollution crisis.\n\n Our results demonstrated that the newer technological modalities have the potential to acquire data, similar to that of conventional technologies.\n\n Demographic variables did not influence the mechanism of usage.\n\n In addition, our findings also suggested that there are acute physical and psychological impacts on the population

2020 during the COVID-19 epidemic in central China.\n\n\nMethods\nIndividuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third day of isolation.\n\n Individual social capital was assessed using the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire.\n\n Anxiety was assessed using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire.\n\n Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearson’s correlation analysis and structural equation

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward

We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time.\n The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative.\n International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial.\n An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required.\n Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience.\n New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure.\n This Position Paper provides a strategy that may be both adapted for, and integrated with, research efforts in other countries.\n","id":"PMC7159850","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emily A","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rory

coronavirus named SARS?CoV?2 (previously known as 2019?nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world.\n This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS?CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS?CoV and MERS?CoV.\n The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID?19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously.\n Additionally, some patients with COVID?19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases.\n The infection of SARS?CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected.\n Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse?connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways.\n Considering the high similarity between SARS?CoV and SARS?CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS?CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID?19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS?CoV?2?induced respiratory failure.\n","id":"PMC7228394","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan?Chao","surname":"Li","email":"liyanchao@jlu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tsutomu","surname":"Hashikawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The relationship between encephalitis lethargica and influenza: a critical analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Human coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses: underestimated opportunistic pathogens of the central nervous system?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Axonal transport enables neuron-to-neuron propagation of human coronavirus OC43","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Immunofluorescence studies on the pathogenesis of hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus infection in pigs after oronasal inoculation","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor: molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic target","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection causes neuronal death in the absence of encephalitis in mice transgenic for human ACE2","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.03.25.009084","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Non-neural expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in the olfactory epithelium suggests mechanisms underlying anosmia in COVID-19 patients","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence of the COVID-19 virus targeting the CNS: tissue distribution, host-virus interaction, and proposed neurotropic mechanisms","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tissue distribution of ACE2 protein, the functional receptor for SARS coronavirus.

A two-stage cluster sampling method was used to randomly select 450 women at midterm and 556 women at endpoint for face-to-face interviews.\n\n\nResults\nCompared to women at midterm, women at endpoint were significantly less likely to report having sexual intercourse in exchange for money or gifts in the past three months (OR?=?2.1, 95 % CI?=?1.6-2.7).\n\n The average number of commercial sexual partners in the past three months also decreased significantly from 5.5 (SD?=?13.3) at midterm to 3.6 (SD?=?13.9) at endpoint (p?=?0.03).\n\n However, women at endpoint were significantly less likely to report always using condom when having sexual intercourse with clients in exchange for money or gifts (OR?=?2.6, 95 % CI?=?1.5-4.5).\n\n Regarding sexually transmitted infections (STIs), women at endpoint were significantly less likely to report having an STI symptom in the past three months (OR?=?1.8, 95 % CI?=?1.4-2.3) and more likely to seek treatment for the most recent STI symptom (OR?=?1.6, 95 % CI?=?1.1-1.9).\n\n Furthermore, women at endpoint were significantly more likely to be currently using a contraceptive method (OR?=?1.4, 95 % CI?=?1.1-1.8) and less likely to report having an induced abortion (OR?=?1.4, 95 % CI?=?1.1-1.7) during the time working as a FEW.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe overall findings of the study indicate that the SAHACOM is effective in reducing

of risk and protective factors in risky sexual behavior among high school students in Cambodia","abstract":"Background\nIn many developing countries, adolescents have become increasingly prone to engage in habitual risky sexual behavior such as early sexual initiation and unprotected sex.\n\n The objective of this study was to identify the operation of risk and protective factors in individual, family, peer, school, and community domains in predicting risky sexual behavior among male and female adolescents in Cambodia.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom October 2007 to January 2008, we collected data from 1,049 students aged 14 to 20 years.\n\n Risky sexual behavior was measured using a scale consisting of four items: sexual intercourse during the past three months, number of sex partners during the past three months, age at first experience of sexual intercourse, and use of condom in last sexual intercourse.\n\n The risk factors examined included substance use, depression, peer delinquency, family violence, and community violence.\n\n Studied protective factors included family support function, frequency of family dinner, and school attachment.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 1,049 students surveyed, 12.7% reported sexual intercourse during the past three months.\n\n Out of those sexually active students, 34.6% reported having two or more sex partners over the same period, and 52.6% did not use a condom during their last sexual intercourse.\n\n After controlling for other covariates, a higher likelihood of risky sexual behavior remained significantly associated among male participants with higher levels of substance use, higher levels of peer delinquency, and higher family income.\n\n In contrast, risky sexual behavior did not retain its associations with any of the measured protective factors among male participants.\n\n Among female participants, a higher likelihood of risky sexual behavior remained significantly associated with higher levels of substance use, higher levels of community-violence witnessing, and lower levels of family support.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe findings suggest the importance of considering gender-related differences in the effects of risk and protective factors when designing and implementing prevention programs.\n\n In interventions for both male and female adolescents, prevention of substance use and risky sexual behavior should

6,510 Korean adults, ages 18 to 64 years old, who were selected from the 2005 Census (2,581 men and 3,929 women).\n\n Participants completed the GHQ-12 and the Korean Composite International

consistency of the GHQ-12 was good (Cronbach's ?=0.72).\n\n Results from the ROC curve indicated that the GHQ-12 yielded greater accuracy when identifying mood and anxiety disorders than when identifying all mental disorders as a whole.\n\n The optimal threshold of the GHQ-12 was either 1/2 or 2/3 point depending on the disorder, but was mainly 2/3.\nConclusion\nThe Korean version of the

= .\n\n82) and test–retest reliability (ICC = .\n\n72) were acceptable.\n\n Concurrent validity was supported by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (with depression, r = 0.425 and anxiety, r = 0.511) and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (with perceived infectability, r = 0.483 and germ aversion, r = 0.459).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe Fear of COVID-19 Scale, a seven-item scale, has robust psychometric properties.\n\n It is reliable and valid in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general population and will also be useful in allaying COVID-19 fears among individuals.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7100496","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniel Kwasi","surname":"Ahorsu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chung-Ying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vida","surname":"Imani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohsen","surname":"Saffari","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark D.","surname":"Griffiths","email":"mark.griffiths@ntu.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amir H.","surname":"Pakpour","email":"pakpour_amir@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s11469-020-00294-0","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Adaptation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Its Association with Psychological Distress and Life Satisfaction in Turkey","abstract":"id='Par1'>The world is currently experiencing a pandemic of an infectious disease called COVID-19 which has drawn global intensive attention.\n While global attention is largely focusing on the effects of the coronavirus on physical health, the impacts of the coronavirus on psychological health cannot be overlooked.\n Therefore, this study aims to adapt the Fear of COVID-19 Scale into Turkish and investigate the relationships between fear of COVID-19, psychological distress, and life satisfaction.\n Data were collected by convenience sampling method, which allowed us to reach total 1304 participants, aged between 18 and 64 years, from 75 cities in Turkey.\n In the adaptation process of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, confirmatory factor analysis, Item Response Theory, convergent validity, and reliability (Cronbach’s ?, McDonald’s ?, Guttmann’s ?6, and composite reliability) analyses were performed.\n Additionally, the mediating role of psychological distress on the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and life satisfaction was tested.\n The uni-dimensionality of the 7-item scale was confirmed on a Turkish sample.\n Item Response Theory revealed that all items were coherent and fit with the model.\n The results indicated that the Turkish version of the scale had satisfactory reliability coefficients.\n The fear of COVID-19 was found to be associated with psychological distress and life satisfaction.\n Results indicated that the Turkish version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale had strong psychometric properties.\n This scale will allow mental health professionals to do research on the psychological impacts of COVID-19 in Turkey.\n","id":"PMC7207987","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Begum","surname":"Satici","email":"begum@artvin.edu.tr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emine","surname":"Gocet-Tekin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30046-8","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Timely mental health care for the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is urgently needed","abstract":"","id":"PMC7128153","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yu-Tao","surname":"Xiang","email":"xyutly@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qinge","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Teris","surname":"Cheung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chee H","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Yilmaz, O., Boz, H., &amp; Arslan, A.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward

The effects of gender and time spent online gaming per week were investigated by multigroup CFA and Rasch differential item functioning (DIF).\n\n\nResults\nThe unidimensionality of the IGDS-SF9 was supported in both CFA and Rasch.\n\n However, Item 4 (fail to control or cease gaming activities) displayed DIF (DIF contrast?=?0.55) slightly over the recommended cutoff in Rasch but was invariant in multigroup CFA across gender.\n\n Items 4 (DIF contrast?=??0.67) and 9 (jeopardize or lose an important thing because of gaming activity; DIF contrast?=?0.61) displayed DIF in Rasch and were non-invariant in multigroup CFA across time spent online gaming.\n\n\nConclusions\nGiven the Persian IGDS-SF9 was unidimensional, it is concluded that the instrument can be used to assess IGD severity.\n\n However, users of the instrument are cautioned concerning the comparisons of the sum scores of the IGDS-SF9 across gender and across adolescents spending different amounts of time online gaming.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5520122","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tzu-Yi","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chung-Ying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kristofer","surname":"Årestedt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark
