Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lanying","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David M.","surname":"Ojcius","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chungen","surname":"Pan","email":"chungenp@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shibo","surname":"Jiang","email":"shibojiang@fudan.edu.cn","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.1164/rccm.2014P7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel Wuhan (2019-nCoV) coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.78.15.7863-7866.2004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus phylogeny: toward consensus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia (trial version 7) [J / OL].

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21.

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

syndrome: an intriguing disease with numerous unsolved dilemmas","abstract":"More than 40 years have passed since Kawasaki syndrome (KS) was first described.\n Yet KS still remains an enigmatic illness which damages the coronary arteries in a quarter of untreated patients and is the most common cause of childhood-acquired heart disease in developed countries.\n Many gaps exist in our knowledge of the etiology and pathogenesis of KS, making improvements in therapy difficult.\n In addition, many KS features and issues still demand further efforts to achieve a much better understanding of the disease.\n Some of these problem areas include coronary artery injuries in children not fulfilling the classic diagnostic criteria, genetic predisposition to KS, unpredictable ineffectiveness of current therapy in some cases, vascular dysfunction in patients not showing echocardiographic evidence of coronary artery abnormalities in the acute phase of KS, and risk of potential premature atherosclerosis.\n Also, the lack of specific laboratory tests for early identification of the atypical and incomplete cases, especially in infants, is one of the main obstacles to beginning treatment early and thereby decreasing the incidence of cardiovascular involvement.\n Transthoracic echocardiography remains the gold-standard for evaluation of coronary arteries in the acute phase and follow-up.\n In KS patients with severe vascular complications, more costly and potentially invasive investigations such as coronary CT angiography and MRI may be necessary.\n As children with KS with or without heart involvement become adolescents and adults, the recognition and treatment of the potential long term sequelae become crucial, requiring that rheumatologists,

outcomes of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) over the past 7 years.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective study included 135 children with KD, admitted to Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, between 2004 and 2005 (group A, n=53) and between 2011 and 2012 (group B, n=82).\n\n Medical records were reviewed to obtain information regarding the presenting signs and symptoms, demographic characteristics, and laboratory and echocardiographic findings associated with KD.\n\n\nResults\nThe hospital admission date after onset was significantly earlier in group B than in group A (P=0.008).\n\n The proportion of patients with incomplete KD was 45.3% and 65.9% in group A and B, respectively (P=0.018).\n\n The number of pretreatment coronary artery lesions (CALs) were significantly lesser in group B than in group A.\n\n (10/53 vs.\n\n 5/82, P=0.021).\n\n No significant differences was observed in the incidence of CALs at discharge, febrile phase duration, hospital stay duration, incidence of retreatment, and intravenous immunoglobulin dose between 2 groups.\n\n The total febrile phase was shorter in patients with incomplete KD than in those with complete KD in both groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe proportion of incomplete KD has become higher.\n\n Furthermore, early admission and management of patients with KD may be related to increased incomplete KD and decreased CALs.\n\n Therefore, we believe that a diagnostic strategy for incomplete KD should be established regardless of the presence of coronary lesions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3819682","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hye Jin","surname":"Kang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gee

Perspective","abstract":"Background\nUnderstanding global seasonal patterns of Kawasaki disease (KD) may provide insight into the etiology of this vasculitis that is now the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries worldwide.\n\n\nMethods\nData from 1970-2012 from 25 countries distributed over the globe were analyzed for seasonality.\n\n The number of KD cases from each location was normalized to minimize the influence of greater numbers from certain locations.\n\n The presence of seasonal variation of KD at the individual locations was evaluated using three different tests: time series modeling, spectral analysis, and a Monte Carlo technique.\n\n\nResults\nA defined seasonal structure emerged demonstrating broad coherence in fluctuations in KD cases across the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropical latitudes.\n\n In the extra-tropical latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, KD case numbers were highest in January through March and approximately 40% higher than in the months of lowest case numbers from August through October.\n\n Datasets were much sparser in the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere extra-tropics and statistical significance of the seasonality tests was weak, but suggested a maximum in May through June, with approximately 30% higher number of cases than in the least active months of February, March and October.\n\n The seasonal pattern in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics was consistent across the first and second halves of the sample period.\n\n\nConclusion\nUsing the first global KD time

low numbers in late summer and fall.\n\n Neither the tropics nor the Southern Hemisphere extra-tropics registered a statistically significant aggregate seasonal cycle.\n\n These data suggest a seasonal exposure to a KD agent that operates over large geographic regions and is concentrated during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere

Disease-Specific Molecules in the Sera Are Linked to Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns in the Biofilms","abstract":"Background\nKawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology.\n\n The innate immune system is involved in its pathophysiology at the acute phase.\n\n We have recently established a novel murine model of KD coronary arteritis by oral administration of a synthetic microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP).\n\n On the hypothesis that specific MAMPs exist in KD sera, we have searched them to identify KD-specific molecules and to assess the pathogenesis.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of fractionated serum samples from 117 patients with KD and 106 controls.\n\n Microbiological and LC-MS evaluation of biofilm samples were also performed.\n\n\nResults\nKD samples elicited proinflammatory cytokine responses from human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs).\n\n By LC-MS analysis of KD serum samples collected at 3 different periods, we detected a variety of KD-specific molecules in the lipophilic fractions that showed distinct m/z and MS/MS fragmentation patterns in each cluster.\n\n Serum KD-specific molecules showed m/z and MS/MS fragmentation patterns almost identical to those of MAMPs obtained from the biofilms formed in vitro (common MAMPs from Bacillus cereus, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus) at the 1st study period, and from the biofilms formed in vivo (common MAMPs from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis/Bacillus cereus/Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus) at the 2nd and 3rd periods.\n\n The biofilm extracts from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus also induced proinflammatory cytokines by HCAECs.\n\n By the experiments with IgG affinity chromatography, some of these serum KD-specific molecules bound to

Receptors","abstract":"Platelets are non-nucleated cells that play central roles in the processes of hemostasis, innate immunity, and inflammation; however, several reports show that these distinct functions are more closely linked than initially thought.\n Platelets express numerous receptors and contain hundreds of secretory products.\n These receptors and secretory products are instrumental to the platelet functional responses.\n The capacity of platelets to secrete copious amounts of cytokines, chemokines, and related molecules appears intimately related to the role of the platelet in inflammation.\n Platelets exhibit non-self-infectious danger detection molecules on their surfaces, including those belonging to the “toll-like receptor” family, as well as pathogen sensors of other natures (Ig- or complement receptors, etc.\n).\n These receptors permit platelets to both bind infectious agents and deliver differential signals leading to the secretion of cytokines/chemokines, under the control of specific intracellular regulatory pathways.\n In contrast, dysfunctional receptors or dysregulation of the intracellular pathway may increase the susceptibility to pathological inflammation.\n Physiological vs.\n pathological inflammation is tightly controlled by the sensors of danger expressed in resting, as well as in activated, platelets.\n These sensors, referred to as pathogen recognition receptors, primarily sense danger signals termed pathogen associated molecular patterns.\n As platelets are found in inflamed tissues and are involved in auto-immune disorders, it is possible that they can also be stimulated by internal pathogens.\n In such cases, platelets can also sense danger signals using damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).\n Some of the most significant DAMP family members are the alarmins, to which the Siglec family of molecules belongs.\n This review examines the role of platelets in anti-infection immunity via their TLRs and Siglec receptors.\n","id":"PMC4345914","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fabrice","surname":"Cognasse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kim

Hospitals specializing in pediatrics, and hospitals with a total of 100 or more beds and a pediatric department, were asked to report all patients with KD during the 2 survey years.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 1445 departments and hospitals reported 23 730 KD patients (10 975 in 2009 and 12 755 in 2010): 13 515 boys and 10 215 girls.\n\n The annual incidence rates were 206.2 and 239.6 per 100 000 children aged 0 to 4 years in 2009 and 2010, respectively; the 2010 rate was the highest ever reported in Japan.\n\n Monthly number of patients peaked during winter to spring months; lower peaks were noted during summer months.\n\n However, the seasonal patterns in 2009 and 2010 differed from those of previous years.\n\n The age-specific incidence rate had a monomodal distribution, with a peak during the latter half of the year of birth.\n\n The prevalences of cardiac lesions during acute KD and cardiac sequelae were higher among infants and older age groups.\n\n Despite a decrease in prevalence, the proportion of patients with giant coronary aneurysms—the most severe sequela of KD—did not substantially decrease.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe incidence rate and number of patients with KD continue to increase in Japan.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3798622","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yosikazu","surname":"Nakamura","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mayumi","surname":"Yashiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ritei","surname":"Uehara","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Atsuko","surname":"Sadakane","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Satoshi","surname":"Tsuboi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yasuko","surname":"Aoyama","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kazuhiko","surname":"Kotani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Enkh-Oyun","surname":"Tsogzolbaatar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hiroshi","surname":"Yanagawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.592865","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prediction

disease","abstract":"Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute self-limiting inflammatory disorder, associated with vasculitis, affecting predominantly medium-sized arteries, particularly the coronary arteries.\n In developed countries KD is the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in childhood.\n The aetiology of KD remains unknown, and it is currently believed that one or more as yet unidentified infectious agents induce an intense inflammatory host response in genetically susceptible individuals.\n Genetic studies have identified several susceptibility genes for KD and its sequelae in different ethnic populations, including FCGR2A, CD40, ITPKC, FAM167A-BLK and CASP3, as well as genes influencing response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aneurysm formation such as FCGR3B, and transforming growth factor (TGF) ? pathway genes.\n IVIG and aspirin are effective therapeutically, but recent clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that the addition of corticosteroids to IVIG is beneficial for the prevention of coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) in severe cases with highest risk of IVIG resistance.\n Outside of Japan, however, clinical scores to predict IVIG resistance perform suboptimally.\n Furthermore, the evidence base does not provide clear guidance on which corticosteroid regimen is most effective.\n Other therapies, including anti-TNF?, could also have a role for IVIG-resistant KD.\n Irrespective of these caveats, it is clear that therapy that reduces inflammation in acute KD, improves outcome.\n This paper summarises recent advances in the understanding of KD pathogenesis and therapeutics, and provides an approach for managing KD patients in the UK in the light of these advances.\n","id":"PMC3888612","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"D","surname":"Eleftheriou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M","surname":"Levin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D","surname":"Shingadia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R","surname":"Tulloh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"NJ","surname":"Klein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"PA","surname":"Brogan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0022-3476(97)70038-6","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prevalence

Non-Responsiveness to Intravenous Immunoglobulin in Kawasaki Syndrome","abstract":"Kawasaki syndrome (KS) is the most relevant cause of heart disease in children living in developed countries.\n Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has a preventive function in the formation of coronary artery abnormalities and a poor strictly-curative action in established coronary damage.\n More than two decades ago, the Harada score was set to assess which children with KS should be subject to administration of IVIG, evaluating retrospectively a large cohort of patients with regard to age, sex and laboratory data.\n Nowadays, high dose IVIG is administered to all children with a confirmed diagnosis of KS, but a tool for predicting non-responsiveness to the initial infusion of IVIG has not been found.\n The prediction of IVIG resistance is a crucial issue, as recognising these high-risk patients should consent the administration of an intensified initial treatment in combination with IVIG in order to prevent coronary injuries.\n Few reports have focused on factors, referring to both clinical parameters and laboratory data at the onset of KS, in order to predict which patients might be IVIG non-responsive.\n We have analysed three different risk scores which were formulated to predict IVIG resistance in Japanese children with typical KS, but their application in non-Japanese patients or in those with incomplete and atypical patterns of the disease has been studied in a fragmentary way.\n Overall, our analysis showed that early and definite ascertainment of likely IVIG non-responders who require additional therapies reducing the development of coronary artery involvement in children with KS is still a challenge.\n","id":"PMC4813142","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Donato","surname":"Rigante","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Andreozzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michele","surname":"Fastiggi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benedetta","surname":"Bracci","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marco

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

oxygenation.\n\n\nConclusions\nCritically ill children with coronavirus disease-2019-associated MIS-C have a spectrum of severity broader than described previously but still require careful supportive intensive care.\n\n Rapid, complete clinical and myocardial recovery was almost

emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in

caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences;

(MERS-CoV), identified in 2012, has caused 182 cases to date, with ~43% mortality, and no small animal model has been reported.\n MERS-CoV and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus (BtCoV) strain HKU5 of Betacoronavirus (?-CoV) subgroup 2c share &gt;65% identity at the amino acid level in several regions, including nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are significant drug and vaccine targets.\n BtCoV HKU5 has been described in silico but has not been shown to replicate in culture, thus hampering drug and vaccine studies against subgroup 2c ?-CoVs.\n We report the synthetic reconstruction and testing of BtCoV HKU5 containing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein ectodomain (BtCoV HKU5-SE).\n This virus replicates efficiently in cell culture and in young and aged mice, where the virus targets airway and alveolar epithelial cells.\n Unlike some subgroup 2b SARS-CoV vaccines that elicit a strong eosinophilia following challenge, we demonstrate that BtCoV HKU5 and MERS-CoV N-expressing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particle (VRP) vaccines do not cause extensive eosinophilia following BtCoV HKU5-SE challenge.\n Passage of BtCoV HKU5-SE in young mice resulted in enhanced virulence, causing 20% weight loss, diffuse alveolar damage, and hyaline membrane formation in aged mice.\n Passaged virus was characterized by mutations in the nsp13, nsp14, open reading frame 5 (ORF5) and M genes.\n Finally, we identified an inhibitor active against the nsp5 proteases of subgroup 2c ?-CoVs.\n Synthetic-genome platforms capable of reconstituting emerging zoonotic viral pathogens or their phylogenetic relatives provide new strategies for identifying broad-based therapeutics, evaluating vaccine outcomes, and studying viral

HCV through behavioural prevention strategies has met with limited success and vaccine development remains slow.\n The development of antiviral therapeutic agents has also been challenging, primarily due to the lack of efficient cell culture and animal models for all HCV genotypes, as well as the large genetic diversity between HCV strains.\n On the other hand, the use of interferon-?-based

that is required for pathogenesis and adaptation.\n However, it is not known how viruses encoding large viral RNA genomes such as the Coronaviridae (26 to 32 kb) balance the requirements for genome stability and quasispecies diversity.\n Further, the limits of replication infidelity during replication of large RNA genomes and how decreased fidelity impacts virus fitness over time are not known.\n Our previous work demonstrated that genetic inactivation of the coronavirus exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of murine hepatitis virus results in a 15-fold decrease in replication fidelity.\n However, it is not known whether nsp14-ExoN is required for replication fidelity of all coronaviruses, nor the impact of decreased fidelity on genome diversity and fitness during replication and passage.\n We report here the engineering and recovery of nsp14-ExoN mutant viruses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that have stable growth defects and demonstrate a 21-fold increase in mutation frequency during replication in culture.\n Analysis of complete genome sequences from SARS-ExoN mutant viral clones revealed unique mutation sets in every genome examined from the same round of replication and a total of 100 unique mutations across the genome.\n Using novel bioinformatic tools and deep sequencing across the full-length genome following 10 population passages in vitro, we demonstrate retention of ExoN mutations and continued increased diversity and mutational load compared to wild-type SARS-CoV.\n The results define a novel genetic and bioinformatics model for introduction and identification of multi-allelic mutations in replication competent viruses that will be powerful tools for testing the effects of decreased fidelity and increased quasispecies diversity on viral replication, pathogenesis, and evolution.\n","id":"PMC2865531","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lance

CoVs treated with 5-FU demonstrated both enhanced sensitivity during multi-cycle replication, as well as decreased specific infectivity, consistent with 5-FU functioning as a mutagen.\n Comparison of full-genome next-generation sequencing of 5-FU treated SARS-CoV populations revealed a 16-fold increase in the number of mutations within the ExoN? population as compared to ExoN+.\n Ninety percent of these mutations represented A:G and U:C transitions, consistent with 5-FU incorporation during RNA synthesis.\n Together our results constitute direct evidence that CoV ExoN activity provides a critical proofreading function during virus replication.\n Furthermore, these studies identify ExoN as the first viral protein distinct from the RdRp that determines the sensitivity of RNA viruses to mutagens.\n Finally, our results show the importance of ExoN as a target for inhibition, and suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of ExoN activity could be potential pan-CoV therapeutics in

SARS-CoV plays a pivotal role in viral replication and is a potential target for anti-SARS therapy.\n There is a lack of structural or biochemical data on any coronavirus polymerase.\n To provide insights into the structure and function of SARS-CoV RdRp, we have located its conserved motifs that are shared by all RdRps, and built a three-dimensional model of the catalytic domain.\n The structural model permits us to discuss the potential functional roles of the conserved motifs and residues in replication and their potential interactions with inhibitors of related enzymes.\n We predict important structural attributes of potential anti-SARS-CoV RdRp nucleotide analog inhibitors: hydrogen-bonding capability for the 2? and 3? groups of the sugar ring and C3? endo sugar puckering, and the absence of a hydrophobic binding pocket for non-nucleoside analog inhibitors similar to those observed in hepatitis C virus RdRp and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase.\n We propose that the clinically observed resistance of SARS to ribavirin is probably due to perturbation of the conserved motif A that controls rNTP binding and fidelity of polymerization.\n Our results suggest that designing anti-SARS therapies can benefit from successful experiences in design of other antiviral drugs.\n This work should also provide guidance for future

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a model pathogen.\n We utilized a time course of matched virologic, pathological, and transcriptomic data within a novel methodological framework that can detect pathway enrichment among key highly connected network genes.\n This unbiased approach produced a high-priority list of 4 genes in one pathway out of over 3,500 genes that were differentially expressed

We validated the importance of the urokinase pathway for SARS-CoV disease severity using genetically defined knockout mice, proteomic correlates of pathway activation, and pathological disease severity.\n The results of these studies demonstrate that a fine balance exists between host coagulation and fibrinolysin pathways regulating pathological disease outcomes, including diffuse alveolar

with analyzed breast milk samples reported on 77 mothers who were\nbreastfeeding their children; among them, 19 of 77 children were confirmed COVID?19\ncases based on RT?PCR assays, including 14 neonates and five older infants.\n Nine of\nthe 68 analyzed breast milk samples from mothers with COVID?19 were positive for\nSARS?CoV?2 RNA; of the exposed infants, four were positive and two were negative for\nCOVID?19.

and mucosal antibody responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 during mild versus severe COVID-19","abstract":"Background\nWhereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody tests are increasingly being used to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the determinants of these antibody responses remain unclear.\n\n\nObjectives\nOur aim was to evaluate systemic and mucosal antibody responses toward SARS-CoV-2 in mild versus severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing immunoassays specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, we determined SARS-CoV-2–specific IgA and IgG in sera and mucosal fluids of 2 cohorts, including SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients (n = 64) and PCR-positive and PCR-negtive health care workers (n = 109).\n\n\nResults\nSARS-CoV-2–specific serum IgA titers in patients with mild COVID-19 were often transiently positive, whereas serum IgG titers remained negative or became positive 12 to 14 days after symptom onset.\n\n Conversely, patients with severe COVID-19 showed a highly significant increase of SARS-CoV-2–specific serum IgA and IgG titers after symptom onset.\n\n Very high titers of SARS-CoV-2–specific serum IgA were correlated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Interestingly, some health care workers with negative SARS-CoV-2–specific serum antibody titers showed SARS-CoV-2–specific IgA in mucosal fluids with virus-neutralizing capacity in some cases.\n\n SARS-CoV-2–specific IgA titers in nasal fluids were inversely correlated with age.\n\n\nConclusions\nSystemic antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 develops mainly in patients with severe COVID-19, with very high IgA titers seen in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, whereas mild disease may be associated with transient production of SARS-CoV-2–specific antibodies but may stimulate mucosal SARS-CoV-2–specific IgA secretion.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7677074","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carlo","surname":"Cervia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jakob","surname":"Nilsson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yves","surname":"Zurbuchen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Valaperti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jens","surname":"Schreiner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aline","surname":"Wolfensberger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Miro

protection against pathogens.\n The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunoglobulin concentrations in milk of 116 lactating mothers over prolonged lactation from the 1st to the 48th month using the ELISA method.\n The concentration of proteins, SIgA and IgG, but not IgM, showed a positive correlation (r = 0.69, p &lt; 0.005; r = 0.54, p &lt; 0.05; and r = 0.27, p &lt; 0.05, respectively) with lactation from the 1st to the 48th month.\n The lowest concentrations of SIgA and IgG were observed for the first year (2.12 ± 0.62 g/L and 14.71 ± 6.18 mg/L, respectively) and the highest after the 2nd year of lactation (7.55 ± 7.16 g/L and 18.95 ± 6.76 mg/L, respectively).\n The IgM concentration remained stable during 2 years (2.81 ± 2.74 mg/L), but after 24 months it was higher (3.82 ± 3.05 mg/L), although not significantly.\n Moreover, negative correlations of protein (r = ?0.24, p &lt; 0.05) and SIgA (r = ?0.47, p &lt; 0.05) concentrations with the number of feedings were found.\n Human milk after the 2nd year of lactation contains significantly higher concentrations of protein, SIgA, and IgG.\n High concentration of immunoglobulins and protein during prolonged lactation is an additional argument to support breastfeeding even after introducing solid foods and should be one of the overarching goals in the protection of children's health.\n","id":"PMC7426452","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matylda","surname":"Czosnykowska-?ukacka","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jolanta","surname":"Lis-Kuberka","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Barbara","surname":"Królak-Olejnik","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Magdalena","surname":"Orczyk-Pawi?owicz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus

diagnosed cases.\n In most cases, there are different risk factors and infections that could play an important role.\n Thus far, different clinical manifestations have been reported in children presenting with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), ranging from asymptomatic status to severe disease sustained by an immune-mediated inflammatory response.\n SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with severe neurological diseases including seizures and encephalitis in both adults and children.\n However, there are still few reports regarding the possible relation between SARS-CoV-2 infection of mothers during pregnancy and the neurologic outcome of the newborns.\n We described the case of a newborn diagnosed with a perinatal stroke, born at 35 weeks of gestation from a mother presenting with SARS- CoV-2 infection during the last months of pregnancy.\n We also added a brief review of the literature with similar cases.\n Close monitoring and early intervention in young children born to infected mothers would be highly recommended for the potential neurodevelopmental

Therapeutic Options","abstract":"Strokes within pediatric populations are considered to be the 10th leading cause of death in the United States of America, with over half of such events occurring in children younger than one year of life.\n The multifactorial etiopathology that has an influence on stroke development and occurrence signify the importance of the timely recognition of both modifiable and non-modifiable factors for adequate diagnostic and treatment approaches.\n The early recognition of a stroke and stroke risk in children has the potential to advance the application of neuroprotective, thrombolytic, and antithrombotic interventions and rehabilitation strategies to the earliest possible timepoints after the onset of a stroke, improving the outcomes and quality of life for affected children and their families.\n The recent development of molecular genetic methods has greatly facilitated the analysis and diagnosis of single-gene disorders.\n In this review, the most significant single gene disorders associated with pediatric stroke are presented, along with specific therapeutic options whenever they exist.\n Besides monogenic disorders that may present with stroke as a first symptom, genetic polymorphisms may contribute to the risk of pediatric and perinatal stroke.\n The most frequently studied genetic risk factors are several common polymorphisms in genes associated with thrombophilia; these genes code for proteins that are part of the coagulation cascade, fibrolysis, homocystein metabolism, lipid metabolism, or platelets.\n Single polymorphism frequencies may not be sufficient to completely explain the stroke causality and an analysis of several genotype combinations is a more promising approach.\n The recent steps forward in our understanding of the disorders underlying strokes has given us a next generation of therapeutics and therapeutic targets by which to improve stroke survival, protect or rebuild neuronal connections in the brain, and enhance neural function.\n Advances in DNA sequencing and the development of new tools to correct human gene mutations have brought genetic analysis and gene therapy into the focus of investigations for new therapeutic options for stroke patients.\n","id":"PMC8835808","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Milena","surname":"Jankovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bojana","surname":"Petrovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Bojana","surname":"Petrovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivana","surname":"Novakovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Slavko","surname":"Brankovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Natasa","surname":"Radosavljevic","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Natasa","surname":"Radosavljevic","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dejan","surname":"Nikolic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cesar","surname":"Borlongan","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Cesar","surname":"Borlongan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cesar","surname":"Borlongan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2012.09.016","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Genetic

infants via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and patients tested positive for GBS in both blood and CSF cultures.\n\n Six infants (75.0%) showed early onset manifestation of the disease (&lt;7

ganglia, cerebral hemispheres, and periventricular or subcortical white matter; these findings are compatible with meningitis.\n\n Findings from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were compatible with bacterial meningitis, showing prominent leptomeningeal enhancement, a widening echogenic interhemisphere, and ventricular wall thickening in all infants.\n\n Restrictive ischemic lesions observed through diffusion-weighted imaging were evident in all eight infants.\n\n Patterns of ischemic injury as detected through MRI were subdivided into 3 groups: 3 infants (37.5%) predominantly showed multiple punctuate lesions in the basal ganglia, 2 infants (25.0%) showed focal or diffuse cerebral infarcts, and 3 infants (37.5%) predominantly showed focal subcortical or periventricular white

coronaviruses: A narrative review for clinicians","abstract":"Introduction\nThe past two decades have been marked by three epidemics linked to emerging coronaviruses.\n\n The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the existence of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and raised the question of the neuropathogenicity of coronaviruses.\n\n The aim of this review was to summarize the current data about neurological manifestations and diseases linked to human coronaviruses.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\nArticles have been identified by searches of PubMed and Google scholar up to September 25, 2020, using a combination of coronavirus and neurology search terms and adding relevant references in the articles.\n\n\nResults\nWe found five cohorts providing prevalence data of neurological symptoms among a total of 2533 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and articles focusing on COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations including a total of 580 patients.\n\n Neurological symptoms involved up to 73% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and were mostly headache, myalgias and impaired consciousness.\n\n Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations reported in COVID-19 were mostly non-specific encephalopathies that represented between 13% and 40% of all neurological manifestations; post-infectious syndromes including acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM, n = 13), acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE, n = 4), Bickerstaff's encephalitis (n = 5), generalized myoclonus (n = 3) and acute transverse myelitis (n = 7); other encephalitis including limbic encephalitis (n = 9) and miscellaneous encephalitis with variable radiologic findings (n = 26); acute cerebrovascular diseases including ischemic strokes (between 1.3% and 4.7% of COVID-19 patients), hemorrhagic strokes (n = 17), cerebral venous thrombosis (n = 8) and posterior reversible encephalopathy (n = 5).\n\n Peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations reported in COVID-19 were the following: Guillain–Barré syndrome (n = 31) and variants including Miller Fisher syndrome (n = 3), polyneuritis cranialis (n = 2) and facial diplegia (n = 2); isolated oculomotor neuropathy (n = 6); critical illness myopathy (n = 6).\n\n Neuropathological studies in COVID-19 patients demonstrated different patterns of CNS damage, mostly ischemic and hemorrhagic changes with few cases of inflammatory injuries.\n\n Only one case suggested SARS-CoV-2 infiltration in endothelial and neural cells.\n\n We found 10 case reports or case series describing 22 patients with neurological manifestations associated with other human coronaviruses.\n\n Among them we found four MERS patients with ADEM or Bickerstaff's encephalitis, two SARS patients with encephalitis who had a positive SARS-CoV PCR in cerebrospinal fluid, five patients with ischemic strokes associated with SARS, eight MERS patients with critical illness neuromyopathy and one MERS patient with Guillain–Barré Syndrome.\n\n An autopsy study on SARS-CoV patients demonstrated the presence of the virus in the brain of eight patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe wide range of neurological manifestations and diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with multiple pathogenic pathways including post-infectious mechanisms, septic-associated encephalopathies, coagulopathy or endothelitis.\n\n There was no definite evidence to support direct neuropathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.\n","id":"PMC7832485","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"A.","surname":"Maury","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.","surname":"Lyoubi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"N.","surname":"Peiffer-Smadja","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T.","surname":"de

the demands on sensory processing (visual vs.\n auditory), sublexical phonological input (words and pseudowords vs.\n nonverbal stimuli), and semantic content (words and objects vs.\n pseudowords and

This statement is extrapolated from previous experience with infections and inflammation which were reported to be fatal by increasing the risk of preterm delivery and causing abnormal neonatal brain development and resulting in neurological disorders like atypical behavioral phenotype or autistic syndrome.\n Given the potentially fatal consequences on neonate health, we highlight the urgent need for an animal model to study vertical transmission.\n The preclinical model will allow us to make the link between SARS-COV-2 infection, inflammation and long-term follow-up of child brain development.\n ","id":"PMC8071483","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mohamed","surname":"Joma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claire-Maelle","surname":"Fovet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nabila","surname":"Seddiki","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nabila","surname":"Seddiki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Gressens","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mireille","surname":"Laforge","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Mireille","surname":"Laforge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph A.","surname":"Tripp","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Ralph A.","surname":"Tripp","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph A.","surname":"Tripp","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/ajcp/aqaa089","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Placental Pathology in COVID-19","abstract":"Objectives\nTo describe histopathologic findings in the placentas of women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy.\n\n\nMethods\nPregnant women with COVID-19 delivering between March 18, 2020, and May 5, 2020, were identified.\n\n Placentas were examined and compared to historical controls and women with placental evaluation for a history of melanoma.\n\n\nResults\nSixteen placentas from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were examined (15 with live birth in the third trimester, 1 delivered in the second trimester after intrauterine fetal demise).\n\n Compared to controls, third trimester placentas were significantly more likely to show at least one feature of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), particularly abnormal or injured maternal vessels, and intervillous thrombi.\n\n Rates of acute and chronic inflammation were not increased.\n\n\nConclusions\nRelative to controls, COVID-19 placentas show increased prevalence of decidual arteriopathy and other features of MVM, a pattern of placental injury reflecting abnormalities in oxygenation within the intervillous space associated with adverse perinatal outcomes.\n\n Only 1 COVID-19 patient was hypertensive despite the association of MVM with hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia.\n\n These changes may reflect a systemic inflammatory or hypercoagulable state influencing placental physiology.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7279066","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Elisheva D","surname":"Shanes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leena B","surname":"Mithal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Otero","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hooman A","surname":"Azad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emily S","surname":"Miller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jeffery A","surname":"Goldstein","email":"ja.goldstein@northwestern.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s13000-021-01067-6","date":"2021-01-04","title":"Placental pathology of the third trimester pregnant women from COVID-19","abstract":"Aims\nid='Par1'>To explore the clinical characteristics and placental pathological changes of pregnant women with 2019 novel coronavirus (CoV) disease (COVID-19) in the third trimester, and to assess the possibility of vertical transmission.\n\n\nMethods and results\nid='Par2'>The placenta tissues were evaluated by using immunohistochemistry for inflammatory cells and Hofbauer cells, and using severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV-2 RNA Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immunofluorescence (IF) double staining.\n\n All eight placentas from the third trimester pregnancy women were studied.\n\n All patients were cured, no clinical or serological evidence pointed to vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

changes in a community outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\n\nMethods\nWe followed up 75 patients for 3 weeks managed with a standard treatment protocol of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and assessed the pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods.\n\n\nFindings\nFever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days.\n\n In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites.\n\n Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission.\n\n Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001).\n\n SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in week 2 is unrelated to uncontrolled viral replication but may be related to immunopathological damage.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112410","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"JSM","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"CM","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"VCC","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"KS","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"IFN","surname":"Hung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"LLM","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"KI","surname":"Law","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"BSF","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"TYW","surname":"Hon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"CS","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"KH","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"JSC","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"BJ","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"WL","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"RWM","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"KY","surname":"Yuen","email":"kyyuen@hkucc.hku.hk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa030685","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Relationships between magnesium and protein concentrations in serum.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0749-0704(05)70157-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hypomagnesemic disorders.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02800-2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pre-eclampsia.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1002/rmv.1980040108","date":"1993-05-04","title":"Human coronaviruses: A brief review","abstract":"","id":"PMC7169162","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"S.

and has no approved antiviral therapy.\n\n We aimed to compare ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a treatment for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection with a supportive therapy only.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (aged ?16 years) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection and pneumonia needing ventilation support, diagnosed between Oct 23, 2012, and May 1, 2014, at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia).\n\n All patients received appropriate supportive care and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring, but patients diagnosed after Sept 16, 2013, were also given oral ribavirin (dose based on calculated creatinine clearance, for 8–10 days) and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 ?g per week for 2 weeks).\n\n The primary endpoint was 14-day and 28-day survival from the date of MERS-CoV infection diagnosis.\n\n We used ?2 and Fischer's exact test to analyse categorical variables and the t test to analyse continuous variables.\n\n\nFindings\nWe analysed 20 patients who received ribavirin and interferon (treatment group; initiated a median of 3 days [range 0–8] after diagnosis) and 24 who did not (comparator group).\n\n Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between groups, apart from baseline absolute neutrophil count, which was significantly lower in the comparator group (5·88?×?109/L [SD 3·95] vs 9·88?×?109/L [6·63]; p=0·023).\n\n 14 (70%) of 20 patients in the treatment group had survived after 14 days, compared with seven (29%) of 24 in the comparator group (p=0·004).\n\n After 28 days, six (30%) of 20 and four (17%) of 24, respectively, had survived (p=0·054).\n\n Adverse effects were similar between groups, apart from reduction in haemoglobin, which was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the comparator group (4·32 g/L [SD 2·47] vs 2·14 g/L [1·90]; p=0·002).\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy is associated with significantly improved survival at 14 days, but not at 28 days.\n\n Further assessment in appropriately designed randomised trials is recommended.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7106357","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ali

features and virological analysis of a case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection","abstract":"Background\nThe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus involved in cases and case clusters of severe acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK.\n\n We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification.\n\n We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes.\n\n\nFindings\nA 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid.\n\n Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2?×?106 copies per mL).\n\n Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay).\n\n One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL).\n\n No virus was detected in blood.\n\n The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation.\n\n The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union; German Centre for Infection Research; German Research Council; and German Ministry for Education and Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7164791","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"drosten@virology-bonn.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Seilmaier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Victor M","surname":"Corman","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wulf","surname":"Hartmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gregor","surname":"Scheible","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Sack","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wolfgang","surname":"Guggemos","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rene","surname":"Kallies","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Doreen","surname":"Muth","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sandra","surname":"Junglen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marcel A","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Walter","surname":"Haas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hana","surname":"Guberina","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tim","surname":"Röhnisch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Monika","surname":"Schmid-Wendtner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Souhaib","surname":"Aldabbagh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ulf","surname":"Dittmer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hermann","surname":"Gold","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Petra","surname":"Graf","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frank","surname":"Bonin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Rambaut","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Clemens-Martin","surname":"Wendtner","email":"clemens.wendtner@klinikum-muenchen.de","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa1211721","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70164-6","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus neutralising serum antibodies in dromedary camels: a comparative serological study","abstract":"Background\nA new betacoronavirus—Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)—has been identified in patients with severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n Although related viruses infect bats, molecular clock analyses have been unable to identify direct ancestors of MERS-CoV.\n\n Anecdotal exposure histories suggest that patients had been in contact with dromedary camels or goats.\n\n We investigated possible animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV by assessing specific serum antibodies in livestock.\n\n\nMethods\nWe took sera from animals in the Middle East (Oman) and from elsewhere (Spain, Netherlands, Chile).\n\n Cattle (n=80), sheep (n=40), goats (n=40), dromedary camels (n=155), and various other camelid species (n=34) were tested for specific serum IgG by protein microarray using the receptor-binding S1 subunits of spike proteins of MERS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and human coronavirus OC43.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David

Influenza Disease Burden from Population-Based Surveillance Data in the United States","abstract":"Annual estimates of the influenza disease burden provide information to evaluate programs and allocate resources.\n We used a multiplier method with routine population-based surveillance data on influenza hospitalization in the United States to correct for under-reporting and estimate the burden of influenza for seasons after the 2009 pandemic.\n Five sites of the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) collected data on the frequency and sensitivity of influenza testing during two seasons to estimate under-detection.\n Population-based rates of influenza-associated hospitalization and Intensive Care Unit admission from 2010–2013 were extrapolated to the U.\nS.\n population from FluSurv-NET and corrected for under-detection.\n Influenza deaths were calculated using a ratio of deaths to hospitalizations.\n We estimated that influenza-related hospitalizations were under-detected during 2010-11 by a factor of 2.1 (95%CI 1.7–2.9) for age &lt; 18 years, 3.1 (2.4–4.5) for ages 18-64 years, and 5.2 (95%CI 3.8–8.3) for age 65+.\n Results were similar in 2011-12. Extrapolated estimates for 3 seasons from 2010–2013 included: 114,192–624,435 hospitalizations, 18,491–95,390 ICU admissions, and 4,915–27,174 deaths per year; 54–70% of hospitalizations and 71–85% of deaths occurred among adults aged 65+.\n Influenza causes a substantial disease burden in the U.\nS.\n that varies by age and season.\n Periodic estimation of multipliers across multiple sites and age groups improves our understanding of influenza detection in sentinel surveillance systems.\n Adjusting surveillance data using a multiplier method is a relatively simple means to estimate the impact of influenza and the subsequent value of interventions to prevent influenza.\n","id":"PMC4349859","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carrie","surname":"Reed","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sandra

and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients","abstract":"Background:\nA patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta.\n\n The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear.\n\n This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively.\n\n The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients’ oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed.\n\n Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs.\n\n The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.\n\n\nResults:\nIn the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study.\n\n In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0–62.0) years were analyzed.\n\n After in-hospital treatment, patients’ inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition.\n\n The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0–11.0) days.\n\n By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients’ stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0–16.0) days after symptom onset.\n\n Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0–4.0) days.\n\n Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients’ urine specimens after throat swabs were negative.\n\n Using a multiple linear regression model (F?=?2.669, P?=?0.044, and adjusted R2?=?0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients’ stools (t?=??2.699, P?=?0.010).\n\n The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs.\n\n 8.0 days, respectively; t?=?2.550, P?=?0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs.\n\n 11 days, respectively; t?=?4.631, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P?&gt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions:\nIn brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients’ stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence.\n\n Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease.\n\n The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shui-Bao","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi-Xiao","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Di","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Qin","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bi-Jie","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"En-Qiang","surname":"Mao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wen-Hong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong-Zhou","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]}]}]}
