associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020.

of small cytokines and generally have low molecular weight ranging from 7 to 15kDa.\n Chemokines and their receptors are able to control the migration and residence of all immune cells.\n Some chemokines are considered pro-inflammatory, and their release can be induced during an immune response at a site of infection, while others are considered homeostatic and are involved in controlling of cells migration during tissue development or maintenance.\n The physiologic importance of this family of mediators is resulting from their specificity ? members of the chemokine family induce recruitment of well-defined leukocyte subsets.\n There are two major chemokine sub-families based upon cysteine residues position: CXC and CC.\n As a general rule, members of the CXC chemokines are chemotactic for neutrophils, and CC chemokines are chemotactic for monocytes and sub-set of lymphocytes, although there are some exceptions.\n This review discusses the potential role of chemokines in

Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East in September, 2012, with 44 laboratory-confirmed cases as of May 23, 2013. We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nPatient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad.\n\n Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders.\n\n We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV.\n\n\nFindings\nInitial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea.\n\n Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\n Both patients developed acute renal failure.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22·9 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22·5 for upE and 23·9 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive.\n\n The two patients shared the same room for 3 days.\n\n The incubation period was estimated at 9–12 days for the second case.\n\n No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected.\n\n Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients with respiratory symptoms returning from the Middle East or exposed to a confirmed case should be isolated and investigated for MERS-CoV with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed incubation period of 12 days.\n\n Immunosuppression should also be taken into account as a risk factor.\n\n\nFunding\nFrench Institute for Public Health Surveillance, ANR grant Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious

until today.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, mediates the virus infection by binding to spike protein.\n Although ACE2 is expressed in the lung, kidney, and intestine, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung.\n Considering the great infectivity of COVID-19, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may depend on other routes to facilitate its infection.\n Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification.\n Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment.\n Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice.\n Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient.\n Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab.\n Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis.\n Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against

tested negative for MERS-CoV on RT-PCR.\n\n\nResults\nNone of the reported MERS-CoV presenting symptoms was significantly associated with being infected with MERS-CoV.\n\n On the other hand, WBC count was significantly lower in patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection (median 5.7 vs 9.3, P: 0.0004).\n\n Neutrophil count was as well significantly lower in MERS-CoV patients (median 3.7 vs 6.7, P: 0.0001).\n\n Both AST, and ALT values were significantly higher in MERS-CoV infected group (AST median 42 vs 36, P: 0.03, and ALT median 33 vs 28, P: 0.003).\n\n Overall our MERS-CoV mortality rate was (10%) below the national figure of (40%).\n\n\nConclusions\nNone of the presenting symptoms are specific for MERS-CoV infection.\n\n And out of all the investigations WBC, neutrophil counts, AST and ALT values have some predictive utility.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7110705","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hamzah

Respiratory syndrome (MERS) first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and remains a global health concern.\n The objective of this study was to compare the clinical features and risk factors for adverse outcome in patients with RT-PCR confirmed MERS and in those with acute respiratory disease who were MERS-CoV negative, presenting to the King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) in Riyadh between October 2012 and May 2014. The demographics, clinical and laboratory characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with RT-PCR confirmed MERS-CoV infection was compared with those testing negative MERS-CoV PCR.\n Health care workers (HCW) with MERS were compared with MERS patients who were not health care workers.\n One hundred and fifty nine patients were eligible for inclusion.\n Forty eight tested positive for MERS CoV, 44 (92%) being hospital acquired infections and 23 were HCW.\n There were 111 MERS-CoV negative patients with acute respiratory illnesses included in this study as “negative controls”.\n Patient with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were not clinically distinguishable from those with negative MERS-CoV RT-PCR results although diarrhoea was commoner in MERS patients.\n A high level of suspicion in initiating laboratory tests for MERS-CoV is therefore indicated.\n Variables associated with adverse outcome were older age and diabetes as a co-morbid illness.\n Interestingly, co-morbid illnesses other than diabetes were not significantly associated with poor outcome.\n Health care workers with MERS had a markedly better clinical outcome compared to non HCW MERS

novel coronavirus (CoV).\n\n Clinical data on MERS-CoV infections are scarce.\n\n We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of MERS-CoV infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities.\n\n\nMethods\nWe abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated MERS-CoV infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n\nFindings\n47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77%) were male (male:female ratio 3·3:1).\n\n 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate.\n\n The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age.\n\n Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96%]) had underlying comorbid medical disorders, including diabetes (32 [68%]), hypertension (16 [34%]), chronic cardiac disease (13 [28%]), and chronic renal disease (23 [49%]).\n\n Common symptoms at presentation were fever (46 [98%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87%]), cough (39 [83%]), shortness of breath (34 [72%]), and myalgia (15 [32%]).\n\n Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea (12 [26%]), vomiting (ten [21%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17%]).\n\n All patients had abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities.\n\n Laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven [15%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34%]).\n\n\nInterpretation\nDisease caused by MERS-CoV presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted

Methods.\n This study was performed based on PRISMA guidelines.\n Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids versus placebo were retrieved from PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central RCTs, and ClinicalTrials.\ngov from January 1980 to April 2018. We also conducted a trial sequential analysis to indicate the possibility of type I or II errors and calculate the information size.\n Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE) was applying to assess the certainty of evidence at the primary outcome level.\n Results.\n Twenty-one RCTs were identified and analyzed.\n Patients treated with corticosteroid had a 7% reduction in relative risk in 28-day all-cause mortality compared to controls (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99).\n However, there were no significant differences for the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09) or in-hospital mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11).\n Corticosteroids shortened the length of ICU stay by 1.04 days (RR -1.04, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.36) and the length of hospital stay by 2.49 days (RR -2.49, 95% CI -4.96 to -0.02).\n Corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16) but not gastroduodenal bleeding (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.37) or superinfection (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.15).\n However, some date on secondary outcomes were unavailable because they were not measured or not reported in the included studies which may cause a lack of power or selective outcome reporting.\n The information size was calculated at 10044 patients.\n Trial sequential analysis showed that the meta-analysis was conclusive and the risk of type 2 error was minimal.\n What Is New and Conclusion.\n Corticosteroids are likely to be effective in reducing 28-day mortality and attenuating septic shock without increasing the rate of life-threatening complications.\n TSA showed that the risk of type II error in this meta-analysis was minimal and the result was conclusive.\n","id":"PMC6590573","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"X.-J.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.-Z.","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-S.","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-X.","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Z.-Z.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T.-H.","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.-C.","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-H.","surname":"Liu","email":"lyh0718@126.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajem.2018.11.040","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Can corticosteroids reduce the mortality of patients with severe sepsis?

of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates.\n Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates.\n Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects.\n However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment.\n We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups.\n We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample.\n The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher?order moments, and interactions.\n The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample.\n Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study.\n We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute

that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates.\n The other estimators resulted in biased

pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days.\n\n In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites.\n\n Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission.\n\n Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001).\n\n SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in week 2 is unrelated to uncontrolled viral replication but may be related to immunopathological damage.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112410","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"JSM","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"CM","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"VCC","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KS","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"IFN","surname":"Hung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"LLM","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KI","surname":"Law","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"BSF","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"TYW","surname":"Hon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"CS","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"KH","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"JSC","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"BJ","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"WL","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"RWM","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KY","surname":"Yuen","email":"kyyuen@hkucc.hku.hk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Profile of specific antibodies to the SARS-associated coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Serology of severe acute respiratory syndrome: implications for surveillance and outcome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS-CoV antibody prevalence in all Hong Kong patient contacts","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early diagnosis of SARS coronavirus infection by real time RT-PCR","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection of SARS coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome by conventional and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection of SARS coronavirus in patients with suspected SARS","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Preclinical evaluation of two real-time, reverse transcription-PCR assays for detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World Health Organization (2003) PCR primers for SARS developed by WHO network laboratories [monograph on the Internet].

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

Methods.\n This study was performed based on PRISMA guidelines.\n Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids versus placebo were retrieved from PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central RCTs, and ClinicalTrials.\ngov from January 1980 to April 2018. We also conducted a trial sequential analysis to indicate the possibility of type I or II errors and calculate the information size.\n Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE) was applying to assess the certainty of evidence at the primary outcome level.\n Results.\n Twenty-one RCTs were identified and analyzed.\n Patients treated with corticosteroid had a 7% reduction in relative risk in 28-day all-cause mortality compared to controls (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99).\n However, there were no significant differences for the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09) or in-hospital mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11).\n Corticosteroids shortened the length of ICU stay by 1.04 days (RR -1.04, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.36) and the length of hospital stay by 2.49 days (RR -2.49, 95% CI -4.96 to -0.02).\n Corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16) but not gastroduodenal bleeding (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.37) or superinfection (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.15).\n However, some date on secondary outcomes were unavailable because they were not measured or not reported in the included studies which may cause a lack of power or selective outcome reporting.\n The information size was calculated at 10044 patients.\n Trial sequential analysis showed that the meta-analysis was conclusive and the risk of type 2 error was minimal.\n What Is New and Conclusion.\n Corticosteroids are likely to be effective in reducing 28-day mortality and attenuating septic shock without increasing the rate of life-threatening complications.\n TSA showed that the risk of type II error in this meta-analysis was minimal and the result was conclusive.\n","id":"PMC6590573","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"X.-J.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"D.-Z.","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y.-S.","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y.-X.","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Z.-Z.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"T.-H.","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.-C.","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y.-H.","surname":"Liu","email":"lyh0718@126.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajem.2018.11.040","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Can corticosteroids reduce the mortality of patients with severe sepsis?

of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates.\n Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates.\n Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects.\n However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment.\n We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups.\n We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample.\n The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher?order moments, and interactions.\n The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample.\n Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study.\n We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute

confounding.\n Previous research has found that these methods result in unbiased estimation when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes.\n However, conventional methods of variance

sandwich?type variance estimator; and (iii) a bootstrap variance estimator.\n We considered estimation of both the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in the treated.\n We found that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates.\n The other estimators resulted in biased

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaolin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xingwang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuelei","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangfa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongmeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Wang","email":"wangjw28@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"caobin_ben@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on

were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in

We also conducted a trial sequential analysis to indicate the possibility of type I or II errors and calculate the information size.\n Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE) was applying to assess the certainty of evidence at the primary outcome level.\n Results.\n Twenty-one RCTs were identified and analyzed.\n Patients treated with corticosteroid had a 7% reduction in relative risk in 28-day all-cause mortality compared to controls (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99).\n However, there were no significant differences for the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09) or in-hospital mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11).\n Corticosteroids shortened the length of ICU stay by 1.04 days (RR -1.04, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.36) and the length of hospital stay by 2.49 days (RR -2.49, 95% CI -4.96 to -0.02).\n Corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16) but not gastroduodenal bleeding (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.37) or superinfection (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.15).\n However, some date on secondary outcomes were unavailable because they were not measured or not reported in the included studies which may cause a lack of power or selective outcome reporting.\n The information size was calculated at 10044 patients.\n Trial sequential analysis showed that the meta-analysis was conclusive and the risk of type 2 error was minimal.\n What Is New and Conclusion.\n Corticosteroids are likely to be effective in reducing 28-day mortality and attenuating septic shock without increasing the rate of life-threatening complications.\n TSA showed that the risk of type II error in this meta-analysis was minimal and the result was conclusive.\n","id":"PMC6590573","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"X.-J.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"D.-Z.","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y.-S.","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y.-X.","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Z.-Z.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"T.-H.","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.-C.","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y.-H.","surname":"Liu","email":"lyh0718@126.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajem.2018.11.040","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Can corticosteroids reduce the mortality of patients with severe sepsis?

of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates.\n Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates.\n Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects.\n However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment.\n We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups.\n We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample.\n The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher?order moments, and interactions.\n The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample.\n Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study.\n We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute

confounding.\n Previous research has found that these methods result in unbiased estimation when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes.\n However, conventional methods of variance

sandwich?type variance estimator; and (iii) a bootstrap variance estimator.\n We considered estimation of both the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in the treated.\n We found that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates.\n The other estimators resulted in biased

admission","abstract":"Background\n\nSeverely ill patients might develop an alteration of their immune system called post-aggressive immunosuppression.\n\n We sought to assess the risk of ICU-acquired infection and of mortality according to the absolute lymphocyte count at ICU admission and its changes over 3 days.\n\n\nMethods\nAdults in ICU for at least 3 days with a shock or persistent low blood pressure were extracted from a French ICU database and included.\n\n We evaluated the impact of the absolute lymphocyte count at baseline and its change at day 3 on the incidence of ICU-acquired infection and on the 28-day mortality rate.\n\n We categorized lymphocytes in 4 groups: above 1.5 × 103 cells/µL; between 1 and 1.5 × 103 cells/µL; between 0.5 and 1 × 103 cells/µL; and below 0.5 × 103 cells/µL.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 753 patients were included.\n\n\nThe median lymphocyte count was 0.8 × 103 cells/µL [0.51–1.29].\n\n A total of 174 (23%) patients developed infections; the 28-day mortality rate was 21% (161/753).\n\n Lymphopenia at admission was associated with ICU-acquired infection (p &lt; 0.001) but not with 28-day mortality.\n\n Independently of baseline lymphocyte count, the absence of lymphocyte count increase at day 3 was associated with ICU-acquired infection (sub-distribution hazard ratio sHR: 1.37 [1.12–1.67], p = 0.002) and with 28-day mortality (sHR: 1.67 [1.37–2.03], p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nConclusion\nLymphopenia at ICU admission and its persistence at day 3 were associated with an increased risk of ICU-acquired infection, while only persisting lymphopenia predicted increased 28-day mortality.\n\n The lymphocyte count at ICU admission and at day 3 could be used as a simple and reproductive marker of post-aggressive immunosuppression.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13613-017-0242-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

predictor of bacteremia in medical emergencies.\n\n Likewise, the neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR) has been shown a simple promising method to evaluate systemic inflammation in critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrospectively evaluated the ability of conventional infection markers, lymphocyte count and NLCR to predict bacteremia in adult patients admitted to the Emergency Department with suspected community-acquired bacteremia.\n\n The C-reactive protein (CRP) level, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and NLCR were compared between patients with positive blood cultures (n = 92) and age-matched and gender-matched patients with negative blood cultures (n = 92) obtained upon Emergency Department admission.\n\n\nResults\nSignificant differences between patients with positive and negative blood cultures were detected with respect to the CRP level (mean ± standard deviation 176 ± 138 mg/l vs.\n\n 116 ± 103 mg/l; P = 0.042),

Sepsis-induced immune alterations are thought to play a major role in patients' mortality and susceptibility to nosocomial infections.\n\n Programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor system constitutes a newly described immunoregulatory pathway that negatively controls immune responses.\n\n It has recently been shown that PD-1 knock-out mice exhibited a lower mortality in response to experimental sepsis.\n\n The objective of the present study was to investigate PD-1-related molecule expressions in septic shock patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThis prospective and observational study included 64 septic shock patients, 13 trauma patients and 49 healthy individuals.\n\n PD-1-related-molecule expressions were measured by flow cytometry on circulating leukocytes.\n\n Plasmatic interleukin (IL)-10 concentration as well as ex vivo mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation were assessed.\n\n\nResults\nWe observed that septic shock patients displayed increased PD-1, PD-Ligand1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2 monocyte expressions and enhanced PD-1 and PD-L1 CD4+ T lymphocyte expressions at day 1-2 and 3-5 after the onset of shock in comparison with patients with trauma and healthy volunteers.\n\n

independently associated with the development of sepsis after major trauma","abstract":"Introduction\nMajor trauma is characterized by an overwhelming pro-inflammatory response and an accompanying anti-inflammatory response that lead to a state of immunosuppression, as observed after septic shock.\n\n Diminished monocyte Human Leukocyte Antigen DR (mHLA-DR) is a reliable marker of monocyte dysfunction and immunosuppression.\n\n The main objective of this study was to determine the relation between mHLA-DR expression in severe trauma patients and the development of sepsis.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a prospective observational study over 23 months in a trauma intensive care unit at a university hospital.\n\n Patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) over 25 and age over 18 were included.\n\n mHLA-DR was assessed by flow cytometry protocol according to standardized protocol.\n\n Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous non-parametric variables, independent paired t test for continuous parametric variables and chi-square test for categorical data were used.\n\n\nResults\nmHLA-DR was measured three times a week during the first 14 days.\n\n One hundred five consecutive severely injured patients were monitored (ISS 38 ± 17, SAPS II 37 ± 16).\n\n Thirty-seven patients (35%) developed sepsis over the 14 days post-trauma.\n\n At days 1-2, mHLA-DR was diminished in the whole patient population, with no difference with the development of sepsis.\n\n At days 3-4, a highly significant difference appeared between septic and non-septic patients.\n\n Non- septic patients showed an increase in mHLA-DR levels, whereas septic patients did not (13,723 ± 7,766 versus 9,271 ± 6,029 antibodies per cell, p = .\n\n004).\n\n Most importantly, multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for usual clinical confounders (adjusted OR 5.41, 95% CI 1.42-20.52), revealed that a slope of mHLA-DR expression between days1-2 and days 3-4 below 1.2 remained associated with the development of sepsis.\n\n\nConclusions\nMajor trauma induced an immunosuppression, characterized by a decrease in mHLA-DR expression.\n\n Importantly, after multivariate regression logistic analysis, persistent decreased expression was assessed to be in relation with the development of sepsis.\n\n This is the first study in trauma patients showing a link between the

acute respiratory distress syndrome: a retrospective observational study","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Lung ultrasound may be a reasonable alternative to chest radiography for the identification of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the diagnostic performance of lung ultrasound for ARDS is uncertain.\n\n We therefore analyzed the clinical outcomes of ARDS diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition, using either chest radiography (Berlin-CXR) or lung ultrasound (Berlin-LUS) as an alternative imaging method.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>This was a retrospective observational study in a 20-bed medical intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n Patients who required noninvasive ventilation or invasive ventilation for hypoxemic respiratory failure on ICU admission from August 2014 to March 2017 were included.\n\n Both chest radiography and lung ultrasound were performed routinely upon ICU admission.\n\n Comparisons were made using either the Berlin-CXR or Berlin-LUS definitions to diagnose ARDS with respect to the patient characteristics and clinical outcomes for each definition.\n\n ICU and hospital mortality were the main outcome measures for both definitions.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The first admissions of 456 distinct patients were analyzed.\n\n Compared with the 216 patients who met the Berlin-CXR definition (ICU mortality 19.4%, hospital mortality 36.1%), 229 patients who met the Berlin-LUS definition (ICU mortality 22.7%, hospital mortality 34.5%) and 79 patients who met the Berlin-LUS but not the Berlin-CXR definition (ICU mortality 21.5%, hospital mortality 29.1%) had similar outcomes.\n\n In contrast, the 295 patients who met either definition had higher mortality than the 161 patients who did not meet either definition (ICU mortality 20.0% versus 12.4%, P?=?0.041; hospital mortality 34.2% versus 24.2%, P?=?0.027).\n\n Compared with Berlin-CXR, Berlin-LUS had a positive predictive value of 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.59–0.72) and a negative predictive value of 0.71 (0.65–0.77).\n\n Among the 216 Berlin-CXR ARDS patients, 150 patients (69.4%) also fulfilled Berlin-LUS definition.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>For the identification of ARDS using the Berlin definition, both chest radiography and lung ultrasound were equally related to mortality.\n\n The Berlin definition using lung ultrasound helped identify patients at higher risk of death, even if these patients did not fulfill the conventional Berlin definition using chest radiography.\n\n However, the moderate overlap of patients when chest imaging modalities differed suggests that chest radiography and lung ultrasound should be complementary rather than used interchangeably.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this

unit.\n\n\nMethods\nFifty patients underwent both lung ultrasound and transpulmonary thermodilution measurement with the PiCCO system.\n\n An ultrasound score based on number of single and confluent B lines per intercostal space was used to quantify pulmonary overhydration.\n\n To check for reproducibility, two different intensivists who were blinded as to the ultrasound pictures reassessed and classified them using the same scoring system.\n\n The results were compared with those obtained using other methods of evaluating hydration status, including extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) and intrathoracic blood volume index calculated with data from transpulmonary thermodilution measurements.\n\n Moreover, chest radiographs were assessed regarding signs of pulmonary overhydration and categorized based on a numeric rating scale.\n\n\nResults\nLung water assessment by ultrasound using a simplified protocol showed excellent correlation with EVLWI over a broad range of lung hydration

2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation.\n\n One of these patients died.\n\n Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown ?-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates.\n\n These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843).\n\n The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade.\n\n Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs.\n\n However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor.\n\n\nConclusion\nA novel bat-borne CoV was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147275","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Li-Li","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ye-Ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Qiang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zi-Chun","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Teng","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhong","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Jun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Wang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guo-Hui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Ying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiu-Yang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin-Ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-Wei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao-Lin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Ping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhen-Shun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Lin","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Hui","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuan","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Wei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Yuan","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Yuan","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pei-Fang","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3","date":"2020-01-28","title":"A

Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team, Li Q.

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China","abstract":"id='Par1'>Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

Immune Signaling and Proteolytic Pathways in the Resolution or Exacerbation of SARS-CoV-2 in Covid-19: Key Therapeutic Targets?","abstract":"COVID-19 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Cov)-2, an enveloped virus with a positive-polarity, single-stranded RNA genome.\n The initial outbreak of the pandemic began in December 2019, and it is affecting the human health of the global community.\n In common with previous pandemics (Influenza H1N1 and SARS-CoV) and the epidemics of Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, CoVs target bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells.\n Virus protein ligands (e.\ng.\n, haemagglutinin or trimeric spike glycoprotein for Influenza and CoV, respectively) interact with cellular receptors, such as (depending on the virus) either sialic acids, Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n Host proteases, e.\ng.\n, cathepsins, furin, or members of the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSP) family, such as Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), are involved in virus entry by proteolytically activating virus ligands.\n Also involved are Toll Like Receptor (TLR) family members, which upregulate anti-viral and pro-inflammatory mediators [interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and type I and type III Interferons among others], through the activation of Nuclear Factor (NF)-kB.\n When these events (virus cellular entry and innate immune responses) are uncontrolled, a deleterious systemic response is sometimes encountered in infected patients, leading to the well-described “cytokine storm” and an ensuing multiple organ failure promoted by a downregulation of dendritic cell, macrophage, and T-cell function.\n We aim to describe how the lung and systemic host innate immune responses affect survival either positively, through downregulating initial viral load, or negatively, by triggering uncontrolled inflammation.\n An emphasis will be put on host cellular signaling pathways and proteases involved with a view on tackling these therapeutically.\n","id":"PMC7270404","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jean-Michel","surname":"Sallenave","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Loïc","surname":"Guillot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References

these patients were studied by histology and virology.\n\n Only one full autopsy was done.\n\n Evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human metapneumovirus was

evidence of recent infection with SARS-CoV.\n\n Diffuse alveolar damage was common but not universal.\n\n Morphological changes identified were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia.\n\n Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case.\n\n A giant-cell infiltrate was seen in four patients, with a pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung.\n\n Haemophagocytosis was present in two patients.\n\n The alveolar pneumocytes also showed cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm.\n\n The patient for whom full

people.\n Influenza virus infection is initiated by the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) through receptor binding and fusion of viral and endosomal membranes.\n HA is synthesized as a precursor protein and requires cleavage by host cell proteases to gain its fusion capacity.\n Although cleavage of HA is crucial for virus infectivity, little was known about relevant proteases in the human airways for a long time.\n Recent progress in the identification and characterization of HA?activating host cell proteases has been considerable however and supports the idea of targeting HA cleavage as a novel approach for influenza treatment.\n Interestingly, certain bacteria have been demonstrated to support HA activation either by secreting proteases that cleave HA or due to activation of cellular proteases and thereby may contribute to virus spread and enhanced pathogenicity.\n In this review, we give an overview on activation of influenza viruses by proteases from host cells and bacteria with the main focus on recent progress on HA cleavage by proteases HAT and TMPRSS2 in the human airway epithelium.\n In addition, we outline investigations of HA?activating proteases as

coronavirus (SARS?CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS.\n Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004

humans and in vitro models of the lung are needed to elucidate cellular targets and the consequences of viral infection.\n The severe and sudden onset of symptoms, resulting in an atypical pneumonia with dry cough and persistent high fever in cases of severe acute respiratory virus brought to light the importance of coronaviruses as potentially lethal human pathogens and the identification of several zoonotic reservoirs has made the reemergence of new strains and future epidemics all the more possible.\n In this chapter, we describe the pathology of SARS-CoV infection in humans and explore the use of two models of the human conducting airway to develop a better understanding of the replication and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in relevant in vitro systems.\n The first culture model is a human bronchial epithelial cell line Calu-3 that can be inoculated by viruses either as a non-polarized monolayer of cells or polarized cells with tight junctions and microvilli.\n The second model system, derived from primary cells isolated from human airway epithelium and grown on Transwells, form a pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium that recapitulates the morphological and physiological features of the human conducting airway in vivo.\n Experimental results using these lung epithelial cell models demonstrate that in contrast to the pathology reported in late stage cases SARS-CoV replicates to high titers in epithelial cells of the conducting airway.\n The SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), was detected exclusively on the apical surface of cells in polarized Calu-3 cells and human airway epithelial cultures (HAE), indicating that hACE2 was accessible by SARS-CoV after lumenal airway delivery.\n Furthermore, in HAE, hACE2 was exclusively localized to ciliated airway epithelial cells.\n In support of the hACE2 localization data, the most productive route of inoculation and progeny virion egress in both polarized Calu-3 and ciliated cells of HAE was the apical surface suggesting mechanisms to release large quantities of virus into the lumen of the human lung.\n Preincubation of the apical surface of cultures with antisera directed against hACE2 reduced viral titers by two logs while antisera against DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR did not reduce viral replication levels suggesting that hACE2 is the primary receptor for entry of SARS-CoV into the ciliated cells of HAE cultures.\n To assess infectivity in ciliated airway cultures derived from susceptible animal species we generated a recombinant SARS-CoV by deletion of open reading frame 7a/7b (ORF 7a/7b) and insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) resulting in SARS-CoV GFP.\n SARS-CoV GFP replicated to similar titers as wild type viruses in Vero E6, MA104, and CaCo2 cells.\n In addition, SARS-CoV replication in airway epithelial cultures generated from Golden Syrian hamster tracheas reached similar titers to the human cultures by 72 h post-infection.\n Efficient SARS-CoV infection of ciliated cell-types in HAE provides a useful in vitro model of human lung origin to study characteristics of SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis.\n","id":"PMC2384224","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Amy

TIRAP, and TICAM2 but not the RIG-I signaling cascade.\n Blocking the secretion of M protein by brefeldin A (BFA) failed to reverse the M-mediated IFN-? induction.\n The antagonist of both TLR2 and

specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) did not prevent M-mediated IFN-? induction.\n SARS-CoV pseudovirus could induce IFN-? production in an M rather than M(V68A) dependent manner, since the valine-to-alanine alteration at residue 68 in M protein markedly inhibited IFN-? production.\n Overall, our study indicates for the first time that a pathogen-derived protein is able to function as a

(SIV) is one of the main known contributors to infectious respiratory diseases.\n The innate immune response to swine influenza viruses has been assessed in many previous studies.\n However most of these studies were carried out in a single-cell population or directly in the live animal, in all its complexity.\n In the current study we report the use of a trachea epithelial cell line (newborn pig trachea cells – NPTr) in comparison with alveolar macrophages and lung slices for the characterization of innate immune response to an infection by a European SIV of the H3N2 subtype.\n The expression pattern of transcripts involved in the recognition of the virus, interferon type I and III responses, and the host-response regulation were assessed by quantitative PCR in response to infection.\n Some significant differences were observed between the three systems, notably in the expression of type III interferon mRNA.\n Then, results show a clear induction of JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling pathways in infected NPTr cells.\n Conversely, PI3K/Akt signaling pathways was not activated.\n The inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway clearly reduced interferon type I and III responses and the induction of SOCS1 at the transcript level in infected NPTr cells.\n Similarly, the inhibition of MAPK pathway reduced viral replication and interferon response.\n All together, these results

fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear.\n Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice.\n In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection.\n Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88?/?), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection.\n The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection.\n MyD88?/? mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection.\n Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88?/? mice compared to wild-type mice.\n Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88?/?mice.\n These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and

been known for many years that infection with IAV predisposes the host to secondary bacterial infections (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus), and there is an abundance of mechanistic studies, including those studying the role of desensitization of TLR signaling, type I IFN- mediated impairment of neutrophil chemokines and antimicrobial production, attenuation of IL1? production etc.\n, showing this.\n However, little is known about the mechanistic events underlying the potential deleterious synergy between Influenza and P.\na co-infections.\n We demonstrate here in vitro in epithelial cells and in vivo in three independent models (two involving mice given IAV +/– P.\na, and one involving mice given IAV +/– IL-1?) that IAV promotes secondary P.\na-mediated lung disease or augmented IL-1?-mediated inflammation.\n We show that IAV-P.\na-mediated deleterious responses includes increased matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity, and MMP-9 in particular, and that the use of the MMP inhibitor improves lung resilience.\n Furthermore, we show that IAV post-transcriptionally inhibits the antimicrobial/anti-protease molecule elafin/trappin-2, which we have shown previously to be anti-inflammatory and to protect the host against maladaptive neutrophilic inflammation in P.\na infections.\n Our work highlights the capacity of IAV to promote further P.\na-mediated lung damage, not necessarily through its interference with host resistance to the bacterium, but by down-regulating tissue resilience to lung inflammation instead.\n Our study therefore suggests that restoring tissue resilience in clinical settings where IAV/P.\na co-exists could prove a fruitful strategy.\n","id":"PMC7031978","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Berengère","surname":"Villeret","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Brigitte","surname":"Solhonne","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marjolène","surname":"Straube","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Flora","surname":"Lemaire","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aurélie","surname":"Cazes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ignacio","surname":"Garcia-Verdugo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Michel","surname":"Sallenave","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41426-018-0063-8","date":"2018-02-25","title":"Blockade

syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) remains poorly understood.\n In a previous study, we established an hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mouse model in which MERS-CoV infection causes severe acute respiratory failure and high mortality accompanied by an elevated secretion of cytokines and chemokines.\n Since excessive complement activation is an important factor that contributes to acute lung injury after viral infection, in this study, we investigated the role of complement in MERS-CoV-induced lung damage.\n Our study showed that complement was excessively activated in MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-Tg mice through observations of increased concentrations of the C5a and C5b-9 complement activation products in sera and lung tissues, respectively.\n Interestingly, blocking C5a production by targeting its receptor, C5aR, alleviated lung and spleen tissue damage and reduced inflammatory responses.\n More importantly, anti-C5aR antibody treatment led to decreased viral replication in lung tissues.\n Furthermore, compared with the sham treatment control, apoptosis of splenic cells was less pronounced in the splenic white pulp of treated mice, and greater number of proliferating splenic cells, particularly in the red pulp, was observed.\n These data indicate that (1) dysregulated host immune responses contribute to the severe outcome of MERS; (2) excessive complement activation, triggered by MERS-CoV infection, promote such dysregulation; and (3) blockade of the C5a–C5aR axis lead to the decreased tissue damage induced by MERS-CoV infection, as manifested by reduced apoptosis and T cell regeneration in the spleen.\n Therefore, the results of this study suggest a new strategy for clinical intervention and adjunctive treatment in MERS-CoV cases.\n","id":"PMC5915580","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yuting","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guangyu","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nianping","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuehong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junfeng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lanying","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shibo","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Renfeng","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shihui","surname":"Sun","email":"sunsh01@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yusen","surname":"Zhou","email":"yszhou@bmi.ac.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.11.008","date":"2012-11-13","title":"SOCS

severe COVID-19 patients","abstract":"Interferons (IFNs) are central to antiviral immunity.\n Viral recognition elicits IFN production, which in turn triggers the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which engage in various antiviral functions.\n Type I IFNs (IFN-? and IFN-?) are widely expressed and can result in immunopathology during viral infections.\n By contrast, type III IFN (IFN-?) responses are primarily restricted to mucosal surfaces and are thought to confer antiviral protection without driving damaging proinflammatory responses.\n Accordingly, IFN-? has been proposed as a therapeutic in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other such viral respiratory diseases (see the Perspective by Grajales-Reyes and Colonna).\n Broggi et al.\n report that COVID-19 patient morbidity correlates with the high expression of type I and III IFNs in the lung.\n Furthermore, IFN-? secreted by dendritic cells in the lungs of mice exposed to synthetic viral RNA causes damage to the lung epithelium, which increases susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections.\n Similarly, using a mouse model of influenza infection, Major et al.\n found that IFN signaling (especially IFN-?) hampers lung repair by inducing p53 and inhibiting epithelial proliferation and differentiation.\n Complicating this picture, Hadjadj et al.\n observed that peripheral blood immune cells from severe and critical COVID-19 patients have diminished type I IFN and enhanced proinflammatory interleukin-6– and tumor necrosis factor-?–fueled responses.\n This suggests that in contrast to local production, systemic production of IFNs may be beneficial.\n The results of this trio of studies suggest that the location, timing, and duration of IFN exposure are critical parameters underlying the success or failure of therapeutics for viral respiratory infections.\n","id":"PMC7402632","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jérôme","surname":"Hadjadj","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nader","surname":"Yatim","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nader","surname":"Yatim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Barnabei","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Barnabei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Aurélien","surname":"Corneau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jeremy","surname":"Boussier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nikaïa","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nikaïa","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hélène","surname":"Péré","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hélène","surname":"Péré","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Charbit","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincent","surname":"Bondet","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Vincent","surname":"Bondet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Camille","surname":"Chenevier-Gobeaux","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Camille","surname":"Chenevier-Gobeaux","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Breillat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Carlier","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Carlier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rémy","surname":"Gauzit","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Rémy","surname":"Gauzit","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Caroline","surname":"Morbieu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frédéric","surname":"Pène","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Marin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Marin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Roche","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tali-Anne","surname":"Szwebel","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tali-Anne","surname":"Szwebel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sarah

Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model.\n\n Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission.\n\n Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-?), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission.\n\n The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan.\n\n The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period.\n\n Survival analysis revealed that male sex, older age, leukocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19.\nConclusions\nPatients with older age, hypertension, and high lactate dehydrogenase level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19.

The clinical symptoms were similar between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough.\n\n Fifteen (78.95%) NCOVID-19 but 4 (26.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had bilateral involvement while 17 (89.47%) NCOVID-19 but 1 (6.67%) NON-NCOVID-19

SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor gene <italic>ACE2</italic> in a wide variety of human tissues","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Since its discovery in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 2 180 000 people worldwide and has caused more than 150 000 deaths as of April 16, 2020. SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor to invade human cells.\n\n Thus, ACE2 is the key to understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n This study is to investigate the ACE2 expression in various human tissues in order to provide insights into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We compared ACE2 expression levels across 31 normal human tissues between males and females and between younger (ages ? 49?years) and older (ages &gt;?49?years) persons using two-sided Student’s t test.\n\n We also investigated the correlations between ACE2 expression and immune signatures in various tissues using Pearson’s correlation test.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>ACE2 expression levels were the highest in the small intestine, testis, kidneys, heart, thyroid, and adipose tissue, and were the lowest in the blood, spleen, bone marrow, brain, blood vessels, and muscle.\n\n ACE2 showed medium expression levels in the lungs, colon, liver, bladder, and adrenal gland.\n\n ACE2 was not differentially expressed between males and females or between younger and older persons in any tissue.\n\n In the skin, digestive system, brain, and blood vessels, ACE2 expression levels were positively associated with immune signatures in both males and females.\n\n In the thyroid and lungs, ACE2 expression levels were positively and negatively associated with immune signatures in males and females, respectively, and in the lungs they had a positive and a negative correlation in the older and younger groups, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Our data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may infect other tissues aside from the lungs and infect persons with different sexes, ages, and races equally.\n\n The different host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection may partially explain why males and females, young and old persons infected with this virus have markedly distinct disease severity.\n\n This study provides new insights into the role of ACE2 in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7186534","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Meng-Yuan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Yue","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Sheng","surname":"Wang","email":"xiaosheng.wang@cpu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}],"References

sought to explore the prevalence and immediate clinical implications of acute myocardial injury in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 in a region of China where medical resources are less stressed

to two designated covid-19 treatment centres in Sichuan, China.\n\n Outcomes of interest included death, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, treatment with vasoactive agents and classification of disease severity.\n\n Acute myocardial injury was defined by a value of high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) greater than the normal upper limit.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 101 cases were enrolled from January to 10 March 2020 (average age 49 years, IQR 34–62 years).\n\n Acute myocardial injury was present in 15.8% of patients, nearly half of whom had a hs-TnT value fivefold greater than the normal upper limit.\n\n Patients with acute myocardial injury were older, with a higher prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease and more likely to require ICU admission (62.5% vs 24.7%, p=0.003), mechanical ventilation (43.5% vs 4.7%, p&lt;0.001) and treatment with vasoactive agents (31.2% vs 0%, p&lt;0.001).\n\n Log hs-TnT was associated with disease severity (OR 6.63, 95% CI 2.24 to 19.65), and all of the three deaths occurred in patients with acute myocardial injury.\n\n\nConclusion\nAcute myocardial injury is common in

cardiovascular comorbidities","abstract":"The high mortality rate of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a critical concern of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\n Strikingly, men account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, with current figures ranging from 59% to 75% of total mortality.\n However, despite clear implications in relation to COVID-19 mortality, most research has not considered sex as a critical factor in data analysis.\n Here, we highlight fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females, and how these may make significant contributions to the male-biased COVID-19 mortality.\n We present preclinical evidence identifying the influence of biological sex on the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells.\n However, we note that there is a lack of reports showing that sexual dimorphism of ACE2 expression exists and is of functional relevance in humans.\n In contrast, there is strong evidence, especially in the context of viral infections, that sexual dimorphism plays a central role in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses, both of the innate and the adaptive immune system.\n We review evidence supporting that ineffective anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, coupled with a predisposition for inappropriate hyperinflammatory responses, could provide a biological explanation for the male bias in COVID-19 mortality.\n A prominent finding in COVID-19 is the increased risk of death with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and age.\n We contextualize how important features of sexual dimorphism and inflammation in COVID-19 may exhibit a reciprocal relationship with comorbidities, and explain their increased mortality risk.\n Ultimately, we demonstrate that biological sex is a fundamental variable of critical relevance to our mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pursuit of effective COVID-19 preventative and therapeutic strategies.\n","id":"PMC7665363","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura

decided to perform a new meta-analysis of the observational studies that explored the relationship between pre-existing hypertension and mortality risk in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, using more stringent inclusion criteria to overcome the limitations inherent previous meta-analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic search of the on-line databases available up to 31 March 2022 was conducted, including peer-reviewed original articles, involving the adult population, where the role of hypertension on mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by Cox-proportional hazard models.\n\n Pooled hazard ratio (HR) was calculated by a random effect model.\n\n Sensitivity, heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-six studies (222,083 participants) met the pre-defined inclusion criteria.\n\n In the pooled analysis, pre-existing hypertension was significantly associated with mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection,

are a leading cause of myocarditis and pericarditis worldwide, conditions that frequently coexist.\n Myocarditis and pericarditis were some of the early comorbidities associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Many epidemiologic studies have been conducted since that time concluding that SARS-CoV-2 increased the incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis at least 15× over pre-COVID levels although the condition remains rare.\n The incidence of myocarditis pre-COVID was reported at 1 to 10 cases/100 000 individuals and with COVID ranging from 150 to 4000 cases/100 000 individuals.\n Before COVID-19, some vaccines were reported to cause myocarditis and pericarditis in rare cases, but the use of novel mRNA platforms led to a higher number of reported cases than with previous platforms providing new insight into potential pathogenic mechanisms.\n The incidence of COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis/pericarditis covers a large range depending on the vaccine platform, age, and sex examined.\n Importantly, the findings highlight that myocarditis occurs predominantly in male patients aged 12 to 40 years regardless of whether the cause was due to a virus-like SARS-CoV-2 or associated with a vaccine—a demographic that has been reported before COVID-19. This review discusses findings from COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis and pericarditis considering the known symptoms, diagnosis, management, treatment, and pathogenesis of disease

(ACE2) is a type I integral membrane that exists in two forms: the first is a transmembrane protein; the second is a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2. The catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17), in which calmodulin mediates the calcium signaling pathway that is involved in ACE2 release, resulting in a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 that can be measured as soluble ACE2 plasma activity.\n The shedding of the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain plays a role in cardiac remodeling and endothelial dysfunction and is a predictor of all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular mortality.\n Moreover, considerable evidence supports that the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain is an essential entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Additionally, endotoxins and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF?) all enhanced soluble catalytic ectodomain ACE2 shedding from the airway epithelia, suggesting that the shedding of ACE2 may represent a mechanism by which viral entry and infection may be controlled such as some types of betacoronavirus.\n In this regard, ACE2 plays an important role in inflammation and thrombotic response, and its down-regulation may aggravate COVID-19 via the renin-angiotensin system, including by promoting pathological changes in lung injury.\n Soluble forms of ACE2 have recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Furthermore, given that vitamin D enhanced the shedding of ACE2, some studies reported that vitamin D treatment is associated with prognosis improvement in COVID-19.

trends and predictors of in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19 and PE in Germany.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used a German nationwide inpatient sample to analyse data on hospitalisations among COVID-19 patients with and without PE during 2020, and to detect changes in PE prevalence and case fatality in comparison with 2019.\nResults\nWe analysed 176?137 COVID-19 hospitalisations in 2020; PE was

changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in lean and obese COVID-19 positive (n=82) and COVID-19 negative (n=24) patients.\n The identified metabolites are found to be mainly correlating with glucose, energy and steroid metabolisms.\n Further data analysis indicated twelve (12) significantly yet differentially abundant metabolites associated with viral infection and health complications, in COVID-19 obese patients.\n Two of the detected metabolites, n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol, are detected only among the COVID-19 cohort, exhibiting significantly higher levels in COVID-19 obese patients when compared to COVID-19 lean patients.\n These metabolites have important roles in viral entry and could explain the increased susceptibility of obese patients.\n On the same note, a set of six metabolites associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory functions displayed significantly lower abundance in COVID-19 obese patients.\n In conclusion, this report highlights the plasma metabolome of COVID-19 obese patients as a metabolic feature and signature to help improve clinical outcomes.\n We propose n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol as potential metabolic markers which warrant further investigations to better understand their involvement in different metabolic pathways in COVID-19.","id":"PMC9161728","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nour","surname":"Jalaleddine","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mahmood","surname":"Hachim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hamza","surname":"Al-Hroub","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Narjes","surname":"Saheb

Protein Complex Formation Increases the Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Induced Cardiomyocyte Dysfunction through ACE2 Upregulation","abstract":"Myocardial damage caused by the newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of the key determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality.\n SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells is initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection.\n Here, we report that ibudilast, which we previously identified as a potent inhibitor of protein complex between transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 3 and NADPH oxidase (Nox) 2, attenuates the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-evoked contractile and metabolic dysfunctions of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs).\n Epidemiologically reported risk factors of severe COVID-19, including cigarette sidestream smoke (CSS) and anti-cancer drug treatment, commonly upregulate ACE2 expression level, and these were suppressed by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation.\n Exposure of NRCMs to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, as well as CSS and doxorubicin (Dox), induces ATP release through pannexin-1 hemi-channels, and this ATP release potentiates pseudovirus entry to NRCMs and human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs).\n As the pseudovirus entry followed by production of reactive oxygen species was attenuated by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex in hiPS-CMs, we suggest that TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation triggered by panexin1-mediated ATP release participates in exacerbation of myocardial

preferentially to triglyceride-rich, very low density lipoproteins, leading to downregulation of LDL receptors).\n ApoE4 also increases the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, decreases their age of onset, or alters their progression.\n ApoE4 likely causes neurodegeneration secondary to its abnormal structure, caused by an interaction between its carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains, called domain interaction.\n When neurons are stressed or injured, they synthesize apoE to redistribute cholesterol for neuronal repair or remodeling.\n However, because of its altered structure, neuronal apoE4 undergoes neuron-specific proteolysis, generating neurotoxic fragments (12–29 kDa) that escape the secretory pathway and cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal alterations, including tau phosphorylation.\n ApoE4-associated pathology can be prevented by small-molecule structure correctors that block domain interaction by converting apoE4 to a molecule that resembles apoE3 both

activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear.\n In this study, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation.\n It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.\n Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation.\n Remarkably, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation.\n The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HUB1-CoV, and influenza virus H1N1 did not activate endothelial cells.\n These findings are consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients.\n In conclusion, the

protect against oxidative damage.\n There is growing evidence to suggest that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients exhibit a wide range of post-recovery symptoms and shows signs related to cardiovascular and specifically, endothelial damage.\n We hypothesized that these vascular symptoms might be associated with disrupted endothelial barrier integrity.\n This was investigated in vitro using endothelial cell culture and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 Receptor-Binding Domain (Spike).\n Mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells from normal (C57BL/6 mice) and diabetic (db/db) mice were used.\n An endothelial transwell permeability assay revealed increased permeability in diabetic cells as well as after Spike treatment.\n The expression of VE-Cadherin, an endothelial adherens junction protein, JAM-A, a tight junctional protein, Connexin-43, a gap junctional protein, and PECAM-1, were all decreased significantly after Spike treatment in control and to a greater extent, in diabetic cells.\n In control cells, Spike treatment increased association of endothelial junctional proteins with Rab5a, a mediator of the endocytic trafficking compartment.\n In cerebral arteries isolated from control and diabetic animals, Spike protein had a greater effect in downregulating expression of endothelial junctional proteins in arteries from diabetic animals than from control animals.\n In conclusion, these experiments reveal that Spike-induced degradation of endothelial junctional proteins affects endothelial barrier function and is the likely cause of

Role of Platelet-Endothelium Interactions in the Pathogenesis of Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection-Associated Myocardial Injury","abstract":"Cardiovascular dysfunction and disease are common and frequently fatal complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Indeed, from early on during the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic it was recognized that cardiac complications may occur, even in patients with no underlying cardiac disorders, as part of the acute infection, and that these were associated with more severe disease and increased morbidity and mortality.\n The most common cardiac complication is acute cardiac injury, defined by significant elevation of cardiac troponins.\n The potential mechanisms of cardiovascular complications include direct viral myocardial injury, systemic inflammation induced by the virus, sepsis, arrhythmia, myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypercoagulability.\n This review is focused on the prevalence, risk factors and clinical course of COVID-19-related myocardial injury, as well as on current data with regard to disease pathogenesis, specifically the interaction of platelets with the vascular endothelium.\n The latter section includes consideration of the role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in triggering development of a generalized endotheliitis that, in turn, drives intense activation of platelets.\n Most prominently, SARS-CoV-2–induced endotheliitis involves interaction of the viral spike protein with endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) together with alternative mechanisms that involve the nucleocapsid and viroporin.\n In addition, the mechanisms by which activated platelets intensify endothelial activation and dysfunction, seemingly driven by release of the platelet-derived calcium-binding proteins, SA100A8 and SA100A9, are described.\n These events create a SARS-CoV-2–driven cycle of intravascular inflammation and coagulation, which contributes significantly to a poor clinical outcome in patients with severe disease.\n","id":"PMC8854752","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Theresa

nonetheless, there are remaining challenges and emerging questions in the field.\n In this article, we aim to summarize the latest information on the impact of the pandemic on blood pressure control, the use of the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in patients with COVID-19, and the blood pressure changes as one of the possible post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (also known as long COVID).\n We also summarize the evidence of telemedicine and COVID-19 vaccination in hypertensive subjects, based on data available as of June 2022.","id":"PMC9780104","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shigeru","surname":"Shibata","email":"shigeru.shibata@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kazuo","surname":"Kobayashi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Masami","surname":"Tanaka","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kei","surname":"Asayama","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eiichiro","surname":"Yamamoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hironori","surname":"Nakagami","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Satoshi","surname":"Hoshide","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Takuya","surname":"Kishi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chisa","surname":"Matsumoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Masaki","surname":"Mogi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Satoshi","surname":"Morimoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Koichi","surname":"Yamamoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Masashi","surname":"Mukoyama","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kazuomi","surname":"Kario","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Koichi","surname":"Node","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hiromi","surname":"Rakugi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.metabol.2022.155236","date":"2022-06-01","title":"SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in the lung, liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic cells via IRF1","abstract":"Background\nCOVID-19 can cause multiple organ damages as well as metabolic abnormalities such as hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and new onset of diabetes.\n\n The insulin/IGF signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism and cell survival, but little is known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n The aim of this work was to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in the host cell/tissue, and if so, the potential mechanism and association with COVID-19 pathology.\n\n\nMethods\nTo determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on insulin/IGF signaling pathway, we utilized transcriptome datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and tissues from public repositories for a wide range of high-throughput gene expression data: autopsy lungs from COVID-19 patients compared to the control from non-COVID-19 patients; lungs from a human ACE2 transgenic mouse infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the control infected with mock; human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived liver organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2; adipose tissues from a mouse model of COVID-19 overexpressing human ACE2 via adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) compared to the control GFP after SARS-CoV-2 infection; iPS-derived human pancreatic cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the mock control.\n\n Gain and loss of IRF1 function models were established in HEK293T and/or Calu3 cells to evaluate the impact on insulin signaling.\n\n To understand the mechanistic regulation and relevance with COVID-19 risk factors, such as older age, male sex, obesity, and diabetes, several transcriptomes of human respiratory, metabolic, and endocrine cells and tissue were analyzed.\n\n To estimate the association with COVID-19 severity, whole blood transcriptomes of critical patients with COVID-19 compared to those of hospitalized noncritical patients with COVID-19.\nResults\nWe found that SARS-CoV-2 infection impaired insulin/IGF signaling pathway genes, such as IRS, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and MAPK, in the host lung, liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic cells.\n\n The impairments were attributed to interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), and its gene expression was highly relevant to risk factors for severe COVID-19; increased with aging in the lung, specifically in men; augmented by obese and diabetic conditions in liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic islets.\n\n IRF1 activation was significantly associated with the impaired insulin signaling in human cells.\n\n IRF1 intron variant rs17622656-A, which was previously reported to be associated with COVID-19 prevalence, increased the IRF1 gene expression in human tissue and was frequently found in American and European population.\n\n Critical patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher IRF1 and lower insulin/IGF signaling pathway genes in the whole blood compared to hospitalized noncritical patients.\n\n Hormonal interventions, such as dihydrotestosterone and dexamethasone, ameliorated the pathological traits in SARS-CoV-2 infectable cells and tissues.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe present study provides the first scientific evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in respiratory, metabolic, and endocrine cells and tissues.\n\n This feature likely contributes to COVID-19 severity with cell/tissue damage and metabolic abnormalities, which may be exacerbated in older, male, obese, or diabetic patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9173833","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jihoon","surname":"Shin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shinichiro","surname":"Toyoda","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shigeki","surname":"Nishitani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Toshiharu","surname":"Onodera","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shiro","surname":"Fukuda","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shunbun","surname":"Kita","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Atsunori","surname":"Fukuhara","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Iichiro","surname":"Shimomura","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113201","date":"2022-05-23","title":"Plasmatic renin-angiotensin system in normotensive and hypertensive patients hospitalized with COVID-19","abstract":"Background\nBesides its counterbalancing role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the receptor for the type 2 coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, the etiological agent of COVID-19.

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

For smaller samples our new formula, devised in this paper, should be used.\n\n We also estimated the variance of an unknown sample using the median, low and high end of the range, and the sample size.\n\n Our estimate is performing as the best estimate in our simulations for very small samples (n ? 15).\n\n For moderately sized samples (15 &lt;n ? 70), our simulations show that the formula range/4 is the best estimator for the standard deviation (variance).\n\n For large samples (n &gt; 70), the formula range/6 gives the best estimator for the standard deviation (variance).\n\n\nConclusion\nUsing these formulas, we hope to help meta-analysts use clinical trials in their analysis even when not all of the information is available and/or

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,
