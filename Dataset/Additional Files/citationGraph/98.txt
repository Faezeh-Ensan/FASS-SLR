paper provides statewide estimates on health care access and utilization patterns and physical and behavioral health by citizenship and documentation status among Latinos in California.\n\n\nMethods:\nThis study used data from the 2011–2015 California Health Interview Survey to examine health care access and utilization and physical and behavioral health among a representative sample of all nonelderly Latino and US-born non-Latino white adults (N=51,386).\n\n Multivariable regressions estimated the associations between the dependent measures and citizenship/documentation status among Latinos (US-born, naturalized citizen, green card holder, and undocumented).\n\n\nResults:\nAdjusted results from multivariable analyses observed worse access and utilization patterns among immigrant Latinos compared with US-born Latinos, with undocumented immigrants using significantly less health care.\n\n Undocumented Latinos had lower odds of self-reporting excellent/very good health status compared with US-born Latinos, despite them having lower odds of having several physical and behavioral health outcomes (overweight/obesity, physician-diagnosed hypertension, asthma, self-reported psychological distress, and need for behavioral health services).\n\n Among those reporting a need for behavioral health services, access was also worse for undocumented Latinos when compared with US-born Latinos.\n\n\nConclusions:\nPatterns of poor health care access and utilization and better physical and behavioral health are observed across the continuum of documentation status, with undocumented immigrants having the worst access and utilization patterns and less disease.\n\n Despite fewer reported diagnoses and better mental health, undocumented Latinos reported poorer health status than their US-born counterparts.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6226215","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander

From the simulated infections, we estimated hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected, age-adjusted for the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site age distribution.\n\n Our findings suggest that a large-scale outbreak is likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp, with 61%–92% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 people infected across scenarios.\n\n On average, in the first 30 days of the outbreak, we expect 18 (95% prediction interval [PI], 2–65), 54 (95% PI, 3–223), and 370 (95% PI, 4–1,850) people infected in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively.\n\n These reach 421,500 (95% PI, 376,300–463,500), 546,800 (95% PI, 499,300–567,000), and 589,800 (95% PI, 578,800–595,600) people infected in 12 months, respectively.\n\n Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 55–136 days, between the low and high transmission scenarios.\n\n We estimate 2,040 (95% PI, 1,660–2,500), 2,650 (95% PI, 2,030–3,380), and 2,880 (95% PI, 2,090–3,830) deaths in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively.\n\n Due to limited data at the time of analyses, we assumed that age was the primary determinant of infection severity and hospitalization.\n\n We expect that comorbidities, limited hospitalization, and intensive care capacity may increase this risk; thus, we may be underestimating the potential burden.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that a COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure that may exceed what is currently feasible in these settings.\n\n Detailed and realistic planning for the worst case in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now.\n\n Plans should consider novel and radical strategies to reduce infectious contacts and fill health worker gaps while recognizing that refugees may not have access to national health systems.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7297408","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shaun","surname":"Truelove","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Orit","surname":"Abrahim","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Orit","surname":"Abrahim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Chiara","surname":"Altare","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Chiara","surname":"Altare","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Stephen A.","surname":"Lauer","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Stephen A.","surname":"Lauer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Krya H.","surname":"Grantz","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Krya H.","surname":"Grantz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Andrew S.","surname":"Azman","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Andrew S.","surname":"Azman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Paul","surname":"Spiegel","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Paul","surname":"Spiegel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Parveen","surname":"Parmar","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":" Parveen","surname":"Parmar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Parveen","surname":"Parmar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"                           NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

Primary articles were identified by English-language Pubmed/MEDLINE, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and Cochrane systemic review database search (1960–June 2009) using the MeSH headings: ARDS, adult respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS, corticosteroids, and methylprednisolone (MP).\n The identified studies were reviewed and information regarding role of corticosteroids in prevention and treatment of ARDS was evaluated.\n Nine trials have evaluated the role of corticosteroid drugs in management of ARDS at various stages.\n Of the 9, 4 trials evaluated role of corticosteroids in prevention of ARDS, while other 5 trials were focused on treatment after variable periods of onset of ARDS.\n Trials with preventive corticosteroids, mostly using high doses of MP, showed negative results with patients in treatment arm, showing higher mortality and rate of ARDS development.\n While trials of corticosteroids in early ARDS showed variable results, somewhat, favoring use of these agents to reduce associated morbidities.\n In late stage of ARDS, these drugs have no benefits and are associated with adverse outcome.\n Use of corticosteroids in patients with early ARDS showed equivocal results in decreasing mortality; however, there is evidence that these drugs reduce organ dysfunction score, lung injury score, ventilator requirement, and intensive care unit stay.\n However, most of these trials are small, having a significant heterogeneity regarding study design, etiology of ARDS, and dosage of corticosteroids.\n Further research involving

management in acute lung injury and ards","abstract":"ARDS is particularly characterized by pulmonary edema caused by an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability.\n It is considered that limiting pulmonary edema or accelerating its resorption through the modulation of fluid intake or oncotic pressure could be beneficial.\n This review discusses the principal clinical studies that have made it possible to progress in the optimization of the fluid state during ARDS.\n Notably, a randomized, multicenter study has suggested that fluid management with the goal to obtain zero fluid balance in ARDS patients without shock or renal failure significantly increases the number of days without mechanical ventilation.\n On the other hand, it is accepted that patients with hemodynamic failure must undergo early and adapted vascular filling.\n Liberal and conservative filling strategies are therefore complementary and should ideally follow each other in time in the same patient whose hemodynamic state progressively stabilizes.\n At present, although albumin treatment has been suggested to improve oxygenation transiently in ARDS patients, no sufficient evidence justifies its use to mitigate pulmonary edema and reduce respiratory morbidity.\n Finally, the resorption of alveolar edema occurs through an active mechanism, which can be pharmacologically upregluated.\n In this sense, the use of beta-2 agonists may be beneficial but further studies are needed to confirm preliminary promising results.\n","id":"PMC3224488","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Antoine","surname":"Roch","email":"antoine.roch@ap-hm.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Guervilly","email":"christophe.guervilly@ap-hm.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laurent","surname":"Papazian","email":"laurent.papazian@ap-hm.fr","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Report

immigrants from low- and middle-income countries and host country women.\n\n The present study identified suboptimal factors related to care-seeking, accessibility, and quality of care for maternal deaths that occurred in Sweden from 1988–2010.\nMethods\nA subset of maternal death records (n?=?75) among foreign-born women from low- and middle-income countries and Swedish-born women were audited using structured implicit review.\n\n One case of foreign-born maternal death was matched with two native born Swedish cases of maternal death.\n\n An assessment protocol was developed that applied both the ‘migration three delays’ framework and a modified version of the Confidential Enquiry from the United Kingdom.\n\n The main outcomes were major and minor suboptimal factors associated with maternal death in this high-income, low-maternal mortality context.\n\n\nResults\nMajor and minor suboptimal factors were associated with a majority of maternal deaths and significantly more often to foreign-born women (p?=?0.01).\n\n The main delays to care-seeking were non-compliance among foreign-born women and communication barriers, such as incongruent language and suboptimal interpreter system or usage.\n\n Inadequate care occurred more often among the foreign-born (p?=?0.04), whereas delays in consultation/referral and miscommunication between health care providers where equally common between the two groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nSuboptimal care factors, major and minor, were present in more than 2/3 of maternal deaths in this high-income setting.\n\n Those related to migration were associated to miscommunication, lack of professional interpreters, and limited knowledge about rare diseases and pregnancy complications.\n\n Increased insight into a migration perspective is advocated for maternity clinicians who provide care to foreign-born women.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3998732","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Annika","surname":"Esscher","email":"annika.esscher@kbh.uu.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pauline","surname":"Binder-Finnema","email":"pauline.binder-finnema@kbh.uu.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Birgit","surname":"Bødker","email":"bib@dadlnet.dk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ulf","surname":"Högberg","email":"ulf.hogberg@kbh.uu.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ajlana","surname":"Mulic-Lutvica","email":"ajlana.lutvica@kbh.uu.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Birgitta","surname":"Essén","email":"birgitta.essen@kbh.uu.se","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.7196/SAMJ.6828","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Impact

increased by 45% (95% credible interval 43–49) in Guinea, 88% (83–93) in Sierra Leone, and 140% (135–147) in Liberia in 2014. This increase is equivalent to 3·5 million (95% credible interval 2·6 million to 4·9 million) additional untreated cases, with 10 900 (5700–21 400) additional malaria-attributable deaths.\n\n Mass drug administration and distribution of insecticide-treated bednets timed to coincide with the 2015 malaria transmission season could largely mitigate the effect of Ebola virus disease on malaria.\n\n\nInterpretation\nid='P5'>These findings suggest that untreated malaria cases as a result of reduced health-care capacity probably contributed substantially to the morbidity caused by the Ebola crisis.\n\n Mass drug administration can be an effective means to mitigate this burden and reduce the number of non-Ebola fever cases within health systems.\n\n\nFunding\nid='P6'>UK Medical Research Council, UK Department for International Development, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4824180","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Patrick G T","surname":"Walker","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael T","surname":"White","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jamie T","surname":"Griffin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alison","surname":"Reynolds","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Neil M","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Azra C","surname":"Ghani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Global, regional, and national incidence and mortality for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria during 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":".

patterns for fatal malaria in Tanzania","abstract":"Background\nOnce malaria occurs, deaths can be prevented by prompt treatment with relatively affordable and efficacious drugs.\n\n Yet this goal is elusive in Africa.\n\n The paradox of a continuing but easily preventable cause of high mortality raises important questions for policy makers concerning care-seeking and access to health systems.\n\n Although patterns of care-seeking during uncomplicated malaria episodes are well known, studies in cases of fatal malaria are rare.\n\n Care-seeking behaviours may differ between these groups.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study documents care-seeking events in 320 children less than five years of age with fatal malaria seen between 1999 and 2001 during over 240,000 person-years of follow-up in a stable perennial malaria transmission setting in southern Tanzania.\n\n Accounts of care-seeking recorded in verbal autopsy histories were analysed to determine providers attended and the sequence of choices made as the patients' condition deteriorated.\n\n\nResults\nAs first resort to care, 78.7% of malaria-attributable deaths used modern biomedical care in the form of antimalarial pharmaceuticals from shops or government or non-governmental heath facilities, 9.4% used initial traditional care at home or from traditional practitioners and 11.9% sought no care of any kind.\n\n There were no differences in patterns of choice by sex of the child, sex of the head of the household, socioeconomic status of the household or presence or absence of convulsions.\n\n In malaria deaths of all ages who sought care more than once, modern care was included in the first or second resort to care in 90.0% and 99.4% with and without convulsions respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study of fatal malaria in southern Tanzania, biomedical care is the preferred choice of an overwhelming majority of suspected malaria cases, even those complicated by convulsions.\n\n Traditional care is no longer a significant delaying factor.\n\n To reduce mortality further will require greater emphasis on recognizing danger signs at home, prompter care-seeking, improved quality of care at health facilities and better adherence to treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC514497","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Don","surname":"de

of this article is to review the principles and methods for validation of population-based disease simulation models.\n\n\nMethods\nWe developed a comprehensive framework for validating population-based chronic disease simulation models and used this framework in a review of published model validation guidelines.\n\n Based on the review, we formulated a set of recommendations for gathering evidence of model credibility.\n\n\nResults\nEvidence of model credibility derives from examining: 1) the process of model development, 2) the performance of a model, and 3) the quality of decisions based on the model.\n\n Many important issues in model validation are insufficiently addressed by current guidelines.\n\n These issues include a detailed evaluation of different data sources, graphical representation of models, computer programming, model calibration, between-model comparisons, sensitivity analysis, and predictive validity.\n\n The role of external data in model validation depends on the purpose of the model (e.\n\ng.\n\n, decision analysis versus prediction).\n\n More research is needed on the methods of comparing the quality of decisions based on different models.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs the role of simulation modeling in population health is increasing and models are becoming more complex, there is a need for further improvements in model validation

in their homes to prevent the spread of the virus.\n The lockdown had serious implications on mental health, resulting in psychological problems including frustration, stress, and depression.\n In order to explore the impacts of this pandemic on the lives of students, we conducted a survey of a total of 1182 individuals of different age groups from various educational institutes in Delhi - National Capital Region (NCR), India.\n The article identified the following as the impact of COVID-19 on the students of different age groups: time spent on online classes and self-study, medium used for learning, sleeping habits, daily fitness routine, and the subsequent effects on weight, social life, and mental health.\n Moreover, our research found that in order to deal with stress and anxiety, participants adopted different coping mechanisms and also sought help from their near ones.\n Further, the research examined the student’s engagement on social media platforms among different age categories.\n This study suggests that public authorities should take all the necessary measures to enhance the learning experience by mitigating the negative impacts caused due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n","id":"PMC7762625","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kunal","surname":"Chaturvedi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dinesh

findings, and epidemiological features of the first series of cases, and a cluster, confirmed in Bolivia.\n\n\nMethods\nFor this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, information was obtained from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health for the cases that were laboratory-diagnosed and related, during March 2020. rRT-PCR was used for the detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 following the protocol Charité, Berlin, Germany, from nasopharyngeal swabs.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 152 suspected cases investigated, 12 (7.9%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infected by rRT-PCR.\n\n The median age was 39 years (IQR 25–43), six of them male.\n\n Two cases proceed from Italy and three from Spain.\n\n Nine patients presented fever, and cough, five sore throat, and myalgia, among other symptoms.\n\n Only a 60 y-old woman with hypertension was hospitalized.\n\n None of the patients required ICU nor fatalities occurred in this group.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis is the first report of

of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosted the largest annual mass gathering of over 3 million pilgrims from 180 plus countries.\n However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens.\n The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics.\n Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation.\n It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics.\n Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics.\n As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease data come from KSA, the cancellation of Umrah by the KSA authorities, prior to emergence of cases, provide the best opportunity to develop mathematical models to quantify event cancellations related mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in KSA and to the home countries of pilgrims.\n COVID-19 has already provided examples of both clearly planned event cancellations such as the Umrah suspension in KSA, and where outbreaks and events were

responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the age-associated vulnerability in the burden of disease and put aging research in the spotlight.\n The limited data available indicates that COVID-19 should be referred to as a gerolavic (from Greek, géros “old man” and epilavís, “harmful”) infection because the infection rates, severity, and lethality are substantially higher in the population aged 60 and older.\n This is primarily due to comorbidity but may be partially due to immunosenescence, decreased immune function in the elderly, and general loss of function, fitness, and increased frailty associated with aging.\n Immunosenescence is a major factor affecting vaccination response, as well as the severity and lethality of infectious diseases.\n While vaccination reduces infection rates, and therapeutic interventions reduce the severity and lethality of infections, these interventions have limitations.\n Previous studies showed that postulated geroprotectors, such as sirolimus (rapamycin) and its close derivative rapalog everolimus (RAD001), decreased infection rates in a small sample of elderly patients.\n This article presents a review of the limited literature available on geroprotective and senoremediative interventions that may be investigated to decrease the disease burden of gerolavic infections.\n This article also highlights a need for rigorous clinical validation of deep aging clocks as surrogate markers of biological age.\n These could be used to assess the need for, and efficacy of, geroprotective and senoremediative interventions and provide better protection for elderly populations from gerolavic infections.\n This article does not represent medical advice and the medications described are not yet licensed or recommended as immune system boosters, as they have not undergone clinical evaluation for this

testing in the management of women with equivocal cervical cytological abnormalities, but not in case of low-grade lesions.\n We performed a meta-analysis including studies where the high-risk probe of the Hybrid Capture-II is used to triage these two cytological categories.\n The triage test-positivity rate reflects the colposcopy referral workload.\nData were pooled on the HPV test positivity rate in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS/ASC-US) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), derived from different cytological classification systems.\n The meta-analysis was restricted to studies, published between 1991 and 2007. A random-effect model was applied for meta-analytical pooling and the influence of covariates on the HPV positivity rate was analyzed by meta-regression.\n The variation by age was assessed within individual studies since age strata were not defined uniformly.\n On an average, 43% (95% CI: 40–46%) of women with ASCUS/ASC-US were high-risk HPV positive (range 23–74%).\n In women with LSIL, the pooled positivity rate was 76% (95% CI: 71–81%; range 55–89%).\n In spite of considerable inter-study heterogeneity, the difference in HPV positivity between the two triage groups was large and highly significant: 32% (95% CI: 27–38%).\n HPV rates dropped tremendously as age and cutoffs of test positivity increased.\n Other factors (cytological classification system, country, continent, collection method and year of publication) had no statistically significant impact, except in LSIL triage where HPV positivity was significantly lower in European compared to American studies.\n Women with LSIL, especially younger women, have high HPV positivity rates suggesting limited utility of reflex HPV triaging these cases.\n Research is needed to identify more specific methods to triage women with low-grade squamous cervical lesions.\n","id":"PMC3822872","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Arbyn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Martin-Hirsch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frank","surname":"Buntinx","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Van Ranst","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Evangelos","surname":"Paraskevaidis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joakim","surname":"Dillner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/1471-0528.12655","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Meta-analysis of the efficacy of cold coagulation as a treatment method for cervical intra-epithelial neoplasis: a systematic review","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.06.095","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence regarding human papillomavirus testing in secondary prevention of cervical cancer","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Human papillomavirus testing versus repeat cytology for triage of minor cytological cervical lesions","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Global call to action for inclusion of migrants and refugees in the COVID-19 response","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Lancet Migration: global collaboration to advance migration health","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Leaving no one behind in the COVID-19 pandemic: a call for urgent global action to include migrants and refugees in the COVID-19 response","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"EU migration policies drive health crisis on Greek islands","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The UCL-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health: the health of a world on the move","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41591-020-0851-2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 in humanitarian settings and lessons learned from past epidemics","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pernitez-Agan S., Bautista M.A., Lopez J. et al.

The practice of mass quarantine made the negative consequences of exclusionary othering for public health particularly noticeable.\n In the light of recent data indicating this measure to be epidemiologically, legally and ethically insufficient, we apply the concept of othering to public health and discuss (1) exclusionary, (2) inclusionary and (3) diversity-sensitive approaches to public health.\n We finally conclude that a shift of perspective from exclusion to inclusion, from subordination to empowerment and from silencing to participation is urgently required.\n","id":"PMC7780422","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marie","surname":"Tallarek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kayvan","surname":"Bozorgmehr","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Kayvan","surname":"Bozorgmehr","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jacob","surname":"Spallek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30758-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 will not leave behind refugees and migrants","abstract":"","id":"PMC7269714","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"The Lancet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Situational brief: COVID-19 &amp; Migration in Germany","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS-CoV-2 in Aufnahmeeinrichtungen und Gemeinschaftsunterkunften fur Gefluchtete: Epidemiologische und normativ-rechtliche Aspekte","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Covid-19 in Fluchtlingsunterkunften: OGD jetzt weiter starken","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/00012272-200006000-00003","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Othering: toward an understanding of difference","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1207/S15327027HC1602_7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Othering and being othered in the context of health care services","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The dynamics of othering in activism as part of Germany's post-2015 &quot;Willkommenskultur&quot;","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.08.061","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Our health and theirs: forced migration, othering, and public health","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1080/1369183X.2017.1348224","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Refugees, migrants, neither, both: categorical fetishism and the politics of bounding in Europe's 'migration crisis'","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"German federal office for migration and refugees.

of Restricting Access to Health Care on Health Expenditures among Asylum-Seekers and Refugees: A Quasi-Experimental Study in Germany, 1994–2013","abstract":"Background\nAccess to health care for asylum-seekers and refugees (AS&amp;R) in Germany is initially restricted before regular access is granted, allegedly leading to delayed care and increasing costs of care.\n\n We analyse the effects of (a) restricted access; and (b) two major policy reforms (1997, 2007) on incident health expenditures for AS&amp;R in 1994-2013.\nMethods and Findings\nWe used annual, nation-wide, aggregate data of the German Federal Statistics Office (1994-2013) to compare incident health expenditures among AS&amp;R with restricted access (exposed) to AS&amp;R with regular access (unexposed).\n\n We calculated incidence rate differences (?IRt) and rate ratios (IRRt), as well as attributable fractions among the exposed (AFe) and the total population (AFp).\n\n The effects of between-group differences in need, and of policy reforms, on differences in per capita expenditures were assessed in (segmented) linear regression models.\n\n The exposed and unexposed groups comprised 4.16 and 1.53 million person-years.\n\n Per capita expenditures (1994–2013) were higher in the group with restricted access in absolute (?IRt = 375.80 Euros [375.77; 375.89]) and relative terms (IRR = 1.39).\n\n The AFe was 28.07% and the AFp 22.21%.\n\n Between-group differences in mean age and in the type of accommodation were the main independent predictors of between-group expenditure differences.\n\n Need variables explained 50-75% of the variation in between-group differences over time.\n\n The 1997 policy reform significantly increased ?IRt adjusted for secular trends and between-group differences in age (by 600.0 Euros [212.6; 986.2]) and sex (by 867.0 Euros [390.9; 1342.5]).\n\n The 2007 policy reform had no such effect.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe cost of excluding AS&amp;R from health care appears ultimately higher than granting regular access to care.\n\n Excess expenditures attributable to the restriction were substantial and could not be completely explained by differences in need.\n\n An evidence-informed discourse on access to health care for AS&amp;R in Germany is needed; it urgently requires high-quality, individual-level data.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4511805","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kayvan","surname":"Bozorgmehr","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Oliver","surname":"Razum","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joan

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaolin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xingwang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuelei","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangfa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongmeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Wang","email":"wangjw28@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"caobin_ben@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.03.02.20030452","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

Bangladesh.\n Behind every one of these lives lost is a complex narrative of historical, social, and political forces, which provide an important context for reproductive health programming in Rohingya camps.\n Rohingya women and girls have experienced human rights violations in Myanmar for decades, including government-sponsored sexual violence and population control efforts.\n An extension of nationalist, anti-Rohingya policies, the attacks of 2017 resulted in the rape and murder of an unknown number of women.\n The socio-cultural context among Rohingya and Bangladeshi host communities limits provision of reproductive health services in the refugee camps, as does a lack of legal status and continued restrictions on movement.\n In this review, the historical, political, and social contexts have been overlaid below on the Three Delays Model, a conceptual framework used to understand the determinants of maternal mortality.\n Attempts to improve maternal mortality among Rohingya women and girls in the refugee camps in Bangladesh should take into account these complex historical, social and political factors in order to reduce maternal mortality.\n","id":"PMC7888086","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Parveen K","surname":"Parmar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rowen

The majority of cases occurred among an estimated 295?000 low-skilled migrant workers living in foreign worker dormitories.\n\n As of 6 May 2020, there were 17?758 confirmed COVID-19 cases among dormitory workers (88% of 20?198 nationally confirmed cases).\n\n One dormitory housing approximately 13?000 workers had 19.4% of residents infected.\n\n The national response included mobilising several government agencies and public volunteers.\n\n There was extensive testing of workers in dormitories, segregation of healthy and infected workers, and daily observation for fever and symptoms.\n\n Twenty-four dormitories were declared as ‘isolation areas’, with residents quarantined for 14 days.\n\n New housing, for example, vacant public housing flats, military camps, exhibition centres, floating hotels have been provided that will allow for appropriate social distancing.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted migrant workers as a vulnerable occupational group.\n\n Ideally, matters related to inadequate housing of vulnerable migrant workers need to be addressed before a pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7476302","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David","surname":"Koh","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}],"References depth
