the last.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the long-term psychiatric morbidities in survivors of SARS.\n\n\nMethod\nThis is a cohort study designed to investigate psychiatric complications among SARS survivors treated in the United Christian Hospital 30 months after the SARS outbreak.\n\n Psychiatric morbidities were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Impact of Events Scale–Revised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n\n Functional outcomes were assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey.\n\n\nResults\nNinety subjects were recruited, yielding a response rate of 96.8%.\n\n Post-SARS cumulative incidence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was 58.9%.\n\n Current prevalence for any psychiatric disorder at 30 months post-SARS was 33.3%.\n\n One-fourth of the patients had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 15.6% had depressive disorders.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe outbreak of SARS can be regarded as a mental health catastrophe.\n\n PTSD was the most prevalent long-term psychiatric condition, followed by depressive disorders.\n\n Our results highlight the need to enhance preparedness and competence of health care professionals in detecting and managing the psychological sequelae of future comparable infectious disease outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112501","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ivan Wing

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

Impact and Coping Strategies of Frontline Medical Staff in Hunan Between January and March 2020 During the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei, China","abstract":"Background\nThroughout China, during the recent epidemic in Hubei province, frontline medical staff have been responsible for tracing contacts of patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact and coping strategies of frontline medical staff in Hunan province, adjacent to Hubei province, during the COVID-19 outbreak between January and March 2020.\nMaterial/Methods\nA cross-sectional observational study included doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff throughout Hunan province between January and March 2020. The study questionnaire included five sections and 67 questions (scores, 0–3).\n\n The chi-squared ?2 test was used to compare the responses between professional groups, age-groups, and gender.\n\n\nResults\nStudy questionnaires were completed by 534 frontline medical staff.\n\n The responses showed that they believed they had a social and professional obligation to continue working long hours.\n\n Medical staff were anxious regarding their safety and the safety of their families and reported psychological effects from reports of mortality from COVID-19 infection.\n\n The availability of strict infection control guidelines, specialized equipment, recognition of their efforts by hospital management and the government, and reduction in reported cases of COVID-19 provided psychological benefit.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei resulted in increased stress for medical staff in adjacent Hunan province.\n\n Continued acknowledgment of the medical staff by hospital management and the government, provision of infection control guidelines, specialized equipment and facilities for the management of COVID-19 infection should be recognized as factors that may encourage medical staff to work during future epidemics.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7177038","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Haozheng","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Baoren","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Limin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yongfang","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"

The questionnaire was restricted to respondents who had to authenticate their RNAO membership with a valid username and password before accessing the questionnaire.\n\n This served a dual purpose: to ensure that only RNAO nurses completed the questionnaire and thereby safeguarding the generalizability of the findings; and second, to prevent any one nurse from contributing more than once to the overall sample.\n\n\nResults\nCorrelational analysis yielded several significant relationships between psychosocial variables and working conditions, and the traditional correlates of burnout and stress.\n\n Three multiple regression analysis revealed that the model we evolved—including higher levels of vigor, organizational support, and trust in equipment/infection control initiative; and lower levels of contact with SARS patients, and time spent in quarantine—predicted to lower levels of avoidance behavior, emotional exhaustion, and state anger.\n\n\nConclusions\nBy employing models of stress and burnout that combine psychosocial variables and working conditions, researchers can account for significant amounts of variance in outcomes related to burnout.\n\n These findings highlight the importance of vigor and perceived organizational support in predicting nurses’ symptoms of burnout.\n\n For healthcare administrators, this means that a likely strategy for assuaging the negative outcomes of stress should address nurses’ psychosocial concerns and the working conditions that they face during novel times of crisis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094220","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zdravko","surname":"Marjanovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Esther R.","surname":"Greenglass","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sue","surname":"Coffey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.healthplace.2017.03.016","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Navigating &quot;riskscapes&quot;: the experiences of international health care workers responding to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1080/1366987032000105315","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Perception of risk: the influence of general trust, and general confidence","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/0272-4332.203034","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Salient value similarity, social trust, and risk/benefit perception","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Siegrist M, Cvetkovich G.

(SARSCoV).\n\n We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thijs","surname":"Kuiken","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ron

patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters.\n\n We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples.\n\n We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked.\n\n\nFindings\nPatients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years.\n\n Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints.\n\n When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild.\n\n Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease.\n\n A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients.\n\n By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nA coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease.\n\n Serological and

Chilean respondents reported higher stress levels (19.8 vs.\n\n 17.7) and a lower Sense of Coherence (55.6 vs.\n\n 58.0) compared to Australian/New Zealand participants (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n The SOC was positively correlated with active coping (p?&lt;?0.01) and positive reframing (p?&lt;?0.01).\n\n Profile analysis showed that when the differences in responses by sex were accounted for, there was no significant effect by country on the coping strategies used (p?&lt;?0.32).\n\n\nConclusion\nThis initial investigation provides insights into the students’ coping strategies and the validity of the SM.\n\n Students reporting high SOC scores where those who demonstrated the use of active coping and positive reframing as strategies to deal with stressful situations, which indicates the accuracy of the theoretical framework of the SM in health education environments.\n\n The results also suggest that a distinctive coping strategy pattern may apply to all participants, regardless of their country and sex.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12909-016-0740-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

distress via certain coping strategies in several different racial and ethnic groups, but few of these studies included indigenous populations.\n\n Elucidating modifiable factors for intervention to reduce the adverse effects of racism on psychological well-being is another avenue to addressing health inequities.\n\n\nMethods\nWe examined the potential mediating effects of 14 distinct coping strategies on the relationship between perceived racism and psychological distress in a community-based sample of 145 Native Hawaiians using structural equation modeling.\n\n\nResults\nPerceived racism had a significant indirect effect on psychological distress, mediated through venting and behavioral disengagement coping strategies, with control for age, gender, educational level, and marital status.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe findings suggest that certain coping strategies may exacerbate the deleterious effects of racism on a person’s psychological well-being.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur study adds Native Hawaiians to the list of U.\n\nS.\n\n racial and ethnic minorities whose psychological well-being is adversely affected by

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaolin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xingwang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiaan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuelei","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guangfa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rongmeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Wang","email":"wangjw28@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"caobin_ben@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Antiviral

To maintain hospital function under critical situations such as a pandemic, it is important to understand the factors that increase and decrease the willingness to work.\n\n Previous hospital-based studies have examined this question using hypothetical events, but so far it has not been examined in an actual pandemic.\n\n Here, we surveyed the factors that influenced the motivation and hesitation of hospital workers to work in Japan soon after the pandemic (H1N1) 2009.\nMethods\nSelf-administered anonymous questionnaires about demographic character and stress factors were distributed to all 3635 employees at three core hospitals in Kobe city, Japan and were collected from June to July, 2009, about one month after the pandemic (H1N1) in Japan.\n\n\nResults\nOf a total of 3635 questionnaires distributed, 1693 (46.7%) valid questionnaires were received.\n\n 28.4% (N = 481) of workers had strong motivation and 14.7% (N = 249) had strong hesitation to work.\n\n Demographic characters and stress-related questions were categorised into four types according to the odds ratios (OR) of motivation and hesitation to work: some factors increased motivation and lowered hesitation; others increased motivation only; others increased hesitation only and others increased both motivation and hesitation.\n\n The strong feeling of being supported by the national and local governments (Multivariate OR: motivation; 3.5; CI 2.2-5.4, hesitation; 0.2; CI 0.1-0.6) and being protected by hospital (Multivariate OR: motivation; 2.8; CI 2.2-3.7, hesitation; 0.5; CI 0.3-0.7) were related to higher motivation and lower hesitation.\n\n Here, protection included taking precautions to prevent illness among workers and their families, providing for the care of those who do become ill, reducing malpractice threats, and financial support for families of workers who die on duty.\n\n But 94.1% of the respondents answered protection by the national and local government was weak and 79.7% answered protection by the hospital was weak.\n\n\nConclusions\nSome factors have conflicting effects because they increase both motivation and hesitation.\n\n Giving workers the feeling that they are being protected by the national and local government and hospital is especially valuable because it increases their motivation and lowers their hesitation to work.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3091577","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hissei","surname":"Imai","email":"hissei@kcgh.gr.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kunitaka","surname":"Matsuishi","email":"kmatuisi@iris.eonet.ne.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Atsushi","surname":"Ito","email":"atsushiito@aol.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kentaro","surname":"Mouri","email":"kjfqy385@ybb.ne.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Noboru","surname":"Kitamura","email":"n-kitamura@hcc6.bai.ne.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Keiko","surname":"Akimoto","email":"maygarden@m6.gyao.ne.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Koichi","surname":"Mino","email":"mino@kobe-nishishimin-hospi.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ayako","surname":"Kawazoe","email":"bunbun5211@yahoo.co.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Masanori","surname":"Isobe","email":"masaniso@yahoo.co.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shizuo","surname":"Takamiya","email":"kanisan@hera.eonet.ne.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tatsuo","surname":"Mita","email":"mita@ja2.so-net.ne.jp","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/1043659605278935","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Providing care and facing death: nursing during Ebola outbreaks in Central Africa","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1046/j.1365-3156.1998.00322.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Survey among survivors of the 1995 Ebola epidemic in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo: their feelings and experiences","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"&quot;A time of fear&quot;: local, national, and international responses to a large Ebola outbreak in Uganda","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"McMahon SA, Ho LS, Brown H, Miller L, Ansumana R, Kennedy CE.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

SARS CoV isolates from Guangzhou shared the same origin with those in other countries, and had a phylogenetic pathway that matched the spread of SARS to the other parts of the world.\n\n\nInterpretation\nSARS CoV is the infectious agent responsible for the epidemic outbreak of SARS in Guangdong.\n\n The virus isolated from patients in Guangdong is the prototype of the SARS CoV in other regions and countries.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112415","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"NS","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"BJ","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"YM","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"LLM","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"ZH","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"KH","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"PH","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"SY","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Q","surname":"Chang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"JP","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"XQ","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"DX","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"KY","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"JSM","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y","surname":"Guan","email":"yguan@hkucc.hku.hk","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa030747","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Identification

Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

allowing early diagnoses in order to promote appropriate treatments.\n\n The objective of this study was to culturally adapt and validate the GAD-7 for the Portuguese patients with generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n\nMethods\nFor the cultural adaptation of the Portuguese version of the GAD-7 scale we started with a previous translation made by Mapi Institute and decided to perform a clinical review followed by a cognitive debriefing with patients.\n\n Once piloted, this version was then tested in a larger sample for feasibility and reliability (1-week test-retest).\n\n Construct validity was assessed by the relationship between GAD-7 and socio-demographic and clinical variables.\n\n Its unidimensionality was tested by principal component factor analysis.\n\n Criterion validity was assessed by comparing GAD-7 scores with those obtained by HADS, and EQ-5D.\n\n STAI was mainly used as a screening indicator for patient inclusion.\n\n\nResults\nGAD-7 was considered feasible with a mean completion time of 2.3 minutes and no major floor or ceiling effects.\n\n We found an excellent Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency score (0.880) and the test-retest and interclass correlation coefficients were also very good.\n\n Regarding the construct validity, younger patients, those with higher education, employed and without anxiety symptoms revealed lower GAD-7 scores, meaning better health.\n\n The unidimensionality of GAD-7 index was also confirmed by principal component factor analysis.\n\n At last, GAD-7 was significantly correlated with other health outcome indices and the classification levels created by it and by HADS showed to be dependent.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe excellent metric properties confirmed the cultural adaptation and validity of GAD-7 into Portuguese population, allowing the clinicians an early detection and treatment of these patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4424548","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tiago

carried out the cultural adaptation into Spanish of the 7-item self-administered GAD-7 scale, which is used to identify probable patients with GAD.\n\n\nMethods\nThe adaptation was performed by an expert panel using a conceptual equivalence process, including forward and backward translations in duplicate.\n\n Content validity was assessed by interrater agreement.\n\n Criteria validity was explored using ROC curve analysis, and sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive value and negative value for different cut-off values were determined.\n\n Concurrent validity was also explored using the HAM-A, HADS, and WHO-DAS-II scales.\n\n\nResults\nThe study sample consisted of 212 subjects (106 patients with GAD) with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD = 16.76).\n\n Average completion time was 2'30''.\n\n No items of the scale were left blank.\n\n Floor and ceiling effects were negligible.\n\n No patients with GAD had to be assisted to fill in the questionnaire.\n\n The scale was shown to be one-dimensional through factor analysis (explained variance = 72%).\n\n A cut-off point of 10 showed adequate values of sensitivity (86.8%) and specificity (93.4%), with AUC being statistically

vaginal closure technique on early post-operative pain following vaginal prolapse surgery: a feasibility pilot study and qualitative assessment","abstract":"Background\nSurgery for pelvic organ prolapse is a common surgical procedure.\n\n There is little research studying post-operative pain, contrasting with extensive literature on pain after childbirth trauma which shows that suture method has a significant effect on pain.\n\n We designed a protocol for a trial comparing suture techniques and post-operative pain, and conducted a pre-protocol pilot to inform our trial design.\n\n\nMethods\nRoutine surgical data, post-operative pain scores (from 10 cm Visual Analogue Scales, VAS) and analgesic requirements were obtained from the notes of a cohort of women undergoing vaginal prolapse surgery.\n\n Median VAS scores at 4, 12 and 24 hours were compared by suture material used and method of closure (single continuous suture or interrupted sutures).\n\n The women whose data were obtained were invited to attend focus groups of up to six people in the twelve weeks following surgery.\n\n A semi structured question guide was used, and interviews were recorded, transcribed anonymously and analysed using the constant comparative method of grounded theory.\n\n Ethical approval was not sought because formal pre-protocol work is exempt for UK ethical requirements, but formal written consent on standard forms was obtained for publishing outcomes and anonymised comments from participants.\n\n\nResults\nComplete VAS data and operative details were available from 41 women.\n\n Surgery was completed using absorbable polyglactin sutures with continuous suturing (17 women) or interrupted sutures (24 women).\n\n Pain scores at 4 and 12 hours were similar; pain at 24 hours was greater in the women with interrupted sutures (median VAS 3 (range 0–8) versus 1.5 (0–8) (p?=?0.0513).\n\n Analgesic needs were similar.\n\n\nConclusions\nFormal pre-protocol work is informative; we found a moderate difference in our proposed outcomes, suggesting a trial was feasible but women themselves were unconvinced of the need for formal research into pain following vaginal surgery.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3887222","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Turlough","surname":"Maguire","email":"tmaguire@doctors.org.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Mayne","email":"christopher.mayne@uhl-tr.nhs.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Janet","surname":"Willars","email":"jw204@le.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Douglas","surname":"Tincello","email":"dgt4@le.ac.uk","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.seizure.2015.02.028","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Marital

Results\n Having epilepsy was more strongly associated with higher unemployment rates (p &lt; 0.0001); job layoffs (p = 0.001); being unfit to work (p &lt; 0.0001); feeling shame for having the

discrepancy between groups was an important limiting factor of this study.\n\n However, despite the limited number of participants and the age difference between the groups, there is no impediment in

Liverpool Adverse Events Profile","abstract":"Introduction\n Adverse events (AEs) associated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) affect people with epilepsy's (PWE) quality of life.\n\n A study conducted in 15 European countries showed that the AEs prevalence of AEDs in PWE was up to 80%.\n\n To date, there are no validated screening instruments to detect AEs of AEDs in Indonesian PWE.\n\n Therefore its epidemiology is currently unknown.\n\n This study aimed to validate the Indonesian version of Liverpool Adverse Events Profile (LAEP), consequently increasing physicians' awareness toward the probability of AEs and its necessary evaluation.\n\n Furthermore, this study was intended to determine the AEs prevalence of AEDs in Indonesian PWE.\n\n\n Methods\n The questionnaire was translated from English into Indonesian version.\n\n The validity and reliability were tested using Spearman correlation and Cronbach's alpha measurement.\n\n An observational cross-sectional study was carried out on consecutive PWE in outpatient clinic, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital.\n\n We analyzed duration of epilepsy, onset of epilepsy, seizure frequency, type of epilepsy, etiology and epilepsy syndrome, number of AEDs, duration of AED use, and comorbidity.\n\n\n Results\n All of the 19 items in the questionnaire were valid, with correlation coefficient ranging from 0.465 to 0.690 (moderate-strong correlation).\n\n Cronbach's alpha value was 0.846 (good consistency).\n\n The total of 90 subjects were enrolled with 91% screened as having AEs using LAEP questionnaire.\n\n The most common AEs were tiredness (67.8%), sleepiness (66.7%), memory problems (62.2%), and difficulty in concentrating (56.7%).\n\n The only clinical variable that influenced AEs was polytherapy.\n\n\n Conclusion\n The Indonesian version of LAEP was a valid and reliable instrument to screen AE of AEDs in PWE.\n\n Almost all the subjects in this study were suspected having AEs.\n\n Polytherapy was the independent

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"  .

accountability during the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa","abstract":"Trust is an essential component of successful cooperative endeavours.\n The global health response to the 2014–2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak confronted historically tenuous regional relationships of trust.\n Challenging sociopolitical contexts and initially inappropriate communication strategies impeded trustworthy relationships between communities and responders during the epidemic.\n Social scientists affiliated with the Ebola 100-Institut Pasteur project interviewed approximately 160 local, national and international responders holding a wide variety of roles during the epidemic.\n Focusing on responder’s experiences of communities’ trust during the epidemic, this qualitative study identifies and explores social techniques for effective emergency response.\n The response required individuals with diverse knowledges and experiences.\n Responders’ included on-the-ground social mobilisers, health workers and clinicians, government officials, ambulance drivers, contact tracers and many more.\n We find that trust was fostered through open, transparent and reflexive communication that was adaptive and accountable to community-led response efforts and to real-time priorities.\n We expand on these findings to identify ‘technologies of trust’ that can be used to promote actively legitimate trustworthy relationships.\n Responders engaged the social technologies of openness (a willingness and genuine effort to incorporate multiple perspectives), reflexivity (flexibly responsive to context and ongoing dialogue) and accountability (taking responsibility for local contexts and consequences) to facilitate relations of trust.\n Technologies of trust contribute to the development of a framework of practical techniques to improve the acceptance and effectiveness of future emergency response strategies","id":"PMC6407545","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Molly

outbreak in Uganda","abstract":"Background\nThis paper documents and analyses some of the responses to the largest Ebola outbreak on record, which took place in Uganda between September 2000 and February 2001. Four hundred and twenty five people developed clinical symptoms in three geographically distinct parts of the country (Gulu, Masindi, and Mbarara), of whom 224 (53%) died.\n\n Given the focus of previous social scientific Ebola research on experiences in communities that have been directly affected, this article expands the lens to include responses to the outbreak in local, national, and international contexts over the course of the outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nResponses to the outbreak were gauged through the articles, editorials, cartoons, and letters that were published in the country’s two main English language daily national newspapers: the New Vision and the Monitor (now the Daily Monitor).\n\n All the relevant pieces from these two sources over the course of the epidemic were cut out, entered onto a computer, and the originals filed.\n\n The three a priori codes, based on the local, national, and international levels, were expanded into six, to include issues that emerged inductively during analysis.\n\n The data within each code were subsequently worked into coherent, chronological narratives.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 639 cuttings were included in the analysis.\n\n Strong and varied responses to the outbreak were identified from across the globe.\n\n These included, among others: confusion, anger, and serious stigma in affected communities; medical staff working themselves to exhaustion, with some quitting their posts; patients fleeing from hospitals; calls on spiritual forces for protection against infection; a well-coordinated national control strategy; and the imposition of some international travel restrictions.\n\n Responses varied both quantitatively and qualitatively according to the level (i.\n\ne.\n\n local, national, or international) at which they were manifested.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe Ugandan experience of 2000/2001 demonstrates that responses to an Ebola outbreak can be very dramatic, but perhaps disproportionate to the actual danger presented.\n\n An important objective for any future outbreak control strategy must be to prevent excessive fear, which, it is expected, would reduce stigma and other negative outcomes.\n\n To this end, the value of openness in the provision of public information, and critically, of being seen to be open, cannot be overstated.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3477054","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"John","surname":"Kinsman","email":"john.kinsman@epiph.umu.se","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/1524839911405850","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Harnessing

syndrome (MERS) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV).\n\n Clinical data on MERS-CoV infections are scarce.\n\n We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of MERS-CoV infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities.\n\n\nMethods\nWe abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated MERS-CoV infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n\nFindings\n47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77%) were male (male:female ratio 3·3:1).\n\n 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate.\n\n The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age.\n\n Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96%]) had underlying comorbid medical disorders, including diabetes (32 [68%]), hypertension (16 [34%]), chronic cardiac disease (13 [28%]), and chronic renal disease (23 [49%]).\n\n Common symptoms at presentation were fever (46 [98%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87%]), cough (39 [83%]), shortness of breath (34 [72%]), and myalgia (15 [32%]).\n\n Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea (12 [26%]), vomiting (ten [21%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17%]).\n\n All patients had abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities.\n\n Laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven [15%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34%]).\n\n\nInterpretation\nDisease caused by MERS-CoV presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical comorbidities.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, community prevalence, and clinical spectrum of infection and disease need urgent

identified the major pathological changes in the respiratory and immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but gained little information on the organ distribution of SARS?associated coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS?CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS?CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS?CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS.\n SARS?CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle.\n These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS?CoV may also be targets of SARS?CoV infection.\n The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS?CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection.\n In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS?CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission.\n This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS?CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways.\n This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS.\n Copyright ©

syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n MERS emerged in 2012 and has a high mortality associated with severe lung disease.\n A lack of autopsy studies from MERS fatalities has hindered understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenesis.\n We investigated the spatial and cellular localization of DPP4 to evaluate an association MERS clinical disease.\n DPP4 was rarely detected in the surface epithelium from nasal cavity to conducting airways with a slightly increased incidence in distal airways.\n DPP4 was also found in a subset of mononuclear leukocytes and in serous cells of submucosal glands.\n In the parenchyma, DPP4 was found principally in type I and II cells and alveolar macrophages and was also detected in vascular endothelium (eg, lymphatics) and pleural mesothelia.\n Patients with chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis, exhibited increased DPP4 immunostaining in alveolar epithelia (type I and II cells) and alveolar macrophages with

syndrome.\n\n\nBackground\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infection from a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute renal impairment has been observed in some patients with SARS.\n\n Herein, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and laboratory features of the acute renal impairment complicating this new viral infection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of the plasma creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters of the 536 SARS patients with normal plasma creatinine at first clinical presentation, admitted to two regional hospitals following a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003. Kidney tissues from seven other patients with postmortem examinations were studied by light microscopy and electron microscopy.\n\n\nResults\nAmong these 536 patients with SARS, 36 (6.7%) developed acute renal impairment occurring at a median duration of 20 days (range 5–48 days) after the onset of viral infection despite a normal plasma creatinine level at first clinical presentation.\n\n The acute renal impairment reflected the different prerenal and renal factors that exerted renal insult occurring in the context of multiorgan failure.\n\n Eventually, 33 SARS patients (91.7%) with acute renal impairment died.\n\n The mortality rate was significantly higher among patients with SARS and acute renal impairment compared with those with SARS and no renal impairment (91.7% vs.\n\n 8.8%) (P &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Renal tissues revealed predominantly acute tubular necrosis with no evidence of glomerular pathology.\n\n The adjusted relative risk of mortality associated with the development of acute renal impairment was 4.057 (P &lt; 0.001).\n\n By multivariate analysis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and age were the most significant independent risk factors predicting the development of acute renal impairment in SARS.\n\n\nConclusion\nAcute renal impairment is uncommon in SARS but carries a high mortality.\n\n The acute renal impairment is likely to be related to multi-organ failure rather than the kidney tropism of the virus.\n\n The development of acute renal impairment is an important negative prognostic indicator for survival with SARS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112337","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kwok Hong","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wai Kay","surname":"Tsang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Colin S.","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Man Fai","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fernand M.","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ka Fai","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ka Shun","surname":"Fung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hon Lok","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wing Wa","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hilda W.H.","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas S.T.","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kwok Lung","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kar Neng","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ijid.2014.09.003","date":"2014-09-25","title":"Clinical aspects and outcomes of 70 patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection: a single-center experience in Saudi Arabia","abstract":"Objectives\nTo report the experience with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection at a single center in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\nMethods\nCases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV occurring from October 1, 2012 to May 31, 2014 were reviewed retrospectively.\n\n Information sources included medical files, infection control outbreak investigations, and the preventive medicine database of MERS-CoV-infected patients.\n\n Data were collected on clinical and epidemiological aspects and outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nSeventy consecutive patients were included.\n\n Patients were mostly of older age (median 62 years), male (46, 65.7%), and had healthcare acquisition of infection (39, 55.7%).\n\n Fever (43, 61.4%), dyspnea (42, 60%), and cough (38, 54.3%) were the most common symptoms.\n\n The majority developed pneumonia (63, 90%) and required intensive care (49, 70%).\n\n Infection commonly occurred in clusters.\n\n Independent risk factors for severe infection requiring intensive care included concomitant infections (odds ratio (OR) 14.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58–126.09;

pcSARS-CoV and huSARS-CoV was subjected to the strongest positive selection pressure during transmission, and there were six amino acid residues within the receptor-binding domain of the S protein being potentially important for SARS progression and tropism.\n Using the single-round infection assay, we found that a two-amino acid substitution (N479K/T487S) of a huSARS-CoV for those of

residues had no effects on the infectivity of huSARS-CoV, these recombinant S proteins bound to human ACE2 with different levels of reduced affinity, and the two-amino acid-substituted S protein showed extremely low affinity.\n On the contrary, substitution of these two amino acid residues of pcSARS-CoV for those of huSRAS-CoV made pcSARS-CoV capable of infecting human ACE2-expressing

Efficacy in Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice.\n\n VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Damon","surname":"Deming","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Heise","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Boyd","surname":"Yount","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mehul","surname":"Suthar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jack","surname":"Harkema","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Whitmore","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Raymond","surname":"Pickles","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ande","surname":"West","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Donaldson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kristopher","surname":"Curtis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Johnston","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ralph","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.79.5.2678-2688.2005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Recombinant

elicited strong T cell IL-4 but minimal IFN-? responses and a much greater antibody response.\n Despite these differences, however, the immunodominant T-cell ELISpot responses to each of the three immunogens were elicited by the same N peptides, with the greatest responses being generated by a cluster of five overlapping peptides, N76–114, each of which contained nonameric H2d binding domains

profiles of T-cell responses were distinctly different.\n The pronounced Th-2 and humoral response to N protein plus adjuvant are in contrast to the balanced IFN-? and IL-4 responses and strong memory

used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nIn response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients.\n\n We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE,

Cell Response and Severe Disease in SARS-CoV-Infected Mice","abstract":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused substantial morbidity and mortality during the 2002–2003 epidemic.\n Many of the features of the human disease are duplicated in BALB/c mice infected with a mouse-adapted version of the virus (MA15), which develop respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality.\n Here, we show that severe disease is correlated with slow kinetics of virus clearance and delayed activation and transit of respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) to the draining lymph nodes (DLN) with a consequent deficient virus-specific T cell response.\n All of these defects are corrected when mice are treated with liposomes containing clodronate, which deplete alveolar macrophages (AM).\n Inhibitory AMs are believed to prevent the development of immune responses to environmental antigens and allergic responses by interacting with lung dendritic cells and T cells.\n The inhibitory effects of AM can also be nullified if mice or AMs are pretreated with poly I:C, which directly activate AMs and rDCs through toll-like receptors 3 (TLR3).\n Further, adoptive transfer of activated but not resting bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (BMDC) protect mice from lethal MA15 infection.\n These results may be relevant for SARS in humans, which is also characterized by prolonged virus persistence and delayed development of a SARS-CoV-specific immune response in individuals with severe disease.\n","id":"PMC2762542","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jincun","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jingxian","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nico","surname":"Van

Is Required for Protection from Lethal Infection with a Mouse-Adapted SARS-CoV","abstract":"A novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, emerged suddenly in 2003, causing approximately 8000 human cases and more than 700 deaths worldwide.\n Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear.\n Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice.\n In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection.\n Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88?/?), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection.\n The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection.\n MyD88?/? mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection.\n Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88?/? mice compared to wild-type mice.\n Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88?/?mice.\n These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung are required for protection from lethal rMA15 infection.\n","id":"PMC2587915","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Timothy","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas

dissemination.\n It remains unknown, however, how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) evades respiratory innate immunity to establish a systemic infection.\n Here we show in Chinese macaques that SARS-CoV traversed the mucosa through the respiratory tract within 2 days, resulting in extensive mucosal infiltration by T cells, MAC387+, and CD163+ monocytes/macrophages followed by limited viral replication in the lung but persistent viral shedding into the upper airway.\n Mucosal monocytes/macrophages sequestered virions in intracellular vesicles together with infected Langerhans cells and migrated into the tonsils and/or draining lymph nodes within 2 days.\n In lymphoid tissues, viral RNA and proteins were detected in infected monocytes upon differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) within 3 days.\n Systemic viral dissemination was observed within 7 days.\n This study provides a comprehensive overview of the spatiotemporal interactions of SARS-CoV, monocytes/macrophages, and the DC network in mucosal tissues and highlights the fact that, while these innate cells contribute to viral clearance, they probably also serve as shelters and vehicles to provide a mechanism for the virus to escape host mucosal innate immunity and disseminate systemically.\n","id":"PMC4900951","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"L","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Q","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"K","surname":"Nishiura","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"H","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"C","surname":"Midkiff","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"X","surname":"Alvarez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"C","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A","surname":"Lackner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Z","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/423240a","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Koch's

in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques

relevant parameters of SARS-CoV infection in NHPs, we infected cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV in three groups: Group I was infected in the nares and bronchus, group II in the nares and conjunctiva, and group III intravenously.\n\n Nonhuman primates in groups I and II developed mild to moderate symptomatic illness.\n\n All NHPs demonstrated evidence of viral replication and developed neutralizing antibodies.\n\n Chest radiographs from several animals in groups I and II revealed unifocal or multifocal pneumonia that peaked between days 8 and 10 postinfection.\n\n Clinical laboratory tests were not significantly changed.\n\n Overall, inoculation by a mucosal route produced more prominent disease than did intravenous inoculation.\n\n Half of the group I animals were infected with a

Since these changes do not interact with the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV, rh-ACE2 in general is as effective as human homolog in supporting viral entry.\n Rh-ACE2, however, is more polymorphic than hu-ACE2. Additional sporadic NS substitutions in clone Rh11-7 reduced the level of rh-ACE2 protein expression and did not support viral entry effectively.\n Further mutagenesis analysis showed that a natural mutation Y217N dramatically alters ACE2 expression and entry efficiency.\n Moreover, introduction of the Y217N mutation into hu-ACE2 caused the down-regulation of expression and reduced viral entry efficiency.\n These results indicate that the Y217N mutation plays a role in modulating SARS-CoV infection.\n Our results provide insights for understanding the role of rh-ACE2 in SARS lung

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

(The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

We found individuals made contact with an average of 12.5 people within 2.9 geographical locations, and spent an average estimated total duration of 9.1 h in contact with others during a day.\n Distributions of the number of contacts and locations in which contacts were made were not significantly different between study waves.\n Encounters were assortative by age, and the age mixing pattern was broadly consistent across study waves.\n Fitting regression models, we examined the association of contact rates (number of contacts, total duration of contact, number of locations) with covariates and calculated the inter- and intra-participant variation in contact rates.\n Participant age was significantly associated with the number of contacts made, the total duration of contact and the number of locations in which contact occurred, with children and parental-age adults having the highest rates of contact.\n The number of contacts and contact duration increased with the number of contact locations.\n Intra-individual variation in contact rate was consistently greater than inter-individual variation.\n Despite substantial individual-level variation, remarkable consistency was observed in contact mixing at the population scale.\n This suggests that aggregate measures of mixing behaviour derived from cross-sectional information may be appropriate for population-scale modelling purposes, and that if more detailed models of social interactions are required for improved public health modelling, further studies are needed to understand the social processes driving intra-individual variation.\n","id":"PMC5805989","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kin On","surname":"Kwok","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vivian","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Steven","surname":"Riley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jonathan M.","surname":"Read","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"South China Morning Post.

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"  .

Stigma: Lessons Learned from HIV/AIDS","abstract":"Background\nHIV/AIDS and Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) are contemporary epidemics associated with significant social stigma in which communities affected suffer from social rejection, violence, and diminished quality of life.\n\n\nObjective\nTo compare and contrast stigma related to HIV/AIDS and EVD, and strategically think how lessons learned from HIV stigma can be applied to the current EVD epidemic.\n\n\nMethods\nTo identify relevant articles about HIV/AIDS and EVD-related stigma, we conducted an extensive literature review using multiple search engines.\n\n PubMed was used to search for relevant peer-reviewed journal articles and Google for online sources.\n\n We also consulted the websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health to retrieve up-to-date information about EVD and HIV/AIDS.\n\n\nResults\nMany stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors directed towards those with EVD are strikingly similar to those with HIV/AIDS but there are significant differences worthy of discussion.\n\n Both diseases are life-threatening and there is no medical cure.\n\n Additionally misinformation about affected groups and modes of transmission runs rampant.\n\n Unlike in persons with EVD, historically criminalized and marginalized populations carry a disproportionately higher risk for HIV infection.\n\n Moreover, mortality due to EVD occurs within a shorter time span as compared to HIV/AIDS.\n\n\nConclusions\nStigma disrupts quality of life, whether it is associated with HIV infection or EVD.\n\n When addressing EVD, we must think beyond the immediate clinical therapeutic response, to possible HIV implications of serum treatment.\n\n There are emerging social concerns of stigma associated with EVD infection and double stigma associated with EVD and HIV infection.\n\n Drawing upon lessons learned from HIV, we must work to empower and mobilize prominent members of the community, those who recovered from the disease, and organizations working at the grassroots level to disseminate clear and accurate information about EVD transmission and prevention while promoting stigma reduction in the process.\n\n In the long run, education, prevention, and a therapeutic vaccine will be the optimal solutions for reducing the stigma associated with both EVD and HIV.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4225220","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mariam","surname":"Davtyan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Brandon","surname":"Brown","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Morenike

outbreak will be the last.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the long-term psychiatric morbidities in survivors of SARS.\n\n\nMethod\nThis is a cohort study designed to investigate psychiatric complications among SARS survivors treated in the United Christian Hospital 30 months after the SARS outbreak.\n\n Psychiatric morbidities were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Impact of Events Scale–Revised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n\n Functional outcomes were assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey.\n\n\nResults\nNinety subjects were recruited, yielding a response rate of 96.8%.\n\n Post-SARS cumulative incidence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was 58.9%.\n\n Current prevalence for any psychiatric disorder at 30 months post-SARS was 33.3%.\n\n One-fourth of the patients had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 15.6% had depressive disorders.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe outbreak of SARS can be regarded as a mental health catastrophe.\n\n PTSD was the most prevalent long-term psychiatric condition, followed by depressive disorders.\n\n Our results highlight the need to enhance
