worldwide is imperative.\n Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected.\n There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected.\n The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend.\n If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30?000 infected patients.\n Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks.\n If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3–4 days, departing from the exponential trend.\n However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.\n","id":"PMC7102589","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Andrea","surname":"Remuzzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Remuzzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1585","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in

COVID-19.\nMethods\nFrom January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included.\n\n With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed.\n\n Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or more.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1014 patients, 59% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans.\n\n The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95%CI, 95-98%, 580/601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results.\n\n In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% (308/413) had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48% were considered as highly likely cases, with 33% as probable cases.\n\n By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 ± 1.5 days; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 ± 2.3 days).\n\n 60% to 93% of cases

Organization as the 2019-nCoV outbreak spreads across the world, with confirmed patients in Canada.\n Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are at risk for developing respiratory failure and requiring

patients and to healthcare workers providing care.\n Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are currently unclear, human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of airborne spread during aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in specific circumstances.\n This paper summarizes important considerations regarding patient screening, environmental controls, personal protective equipment, resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations planning as we prepare for the possibility of new imported cases or local outbreaks of 2019-nCoV.\n Although understanding of the 2019-nCoV virus is evolving, lessons learned from prior infectious disease challenges such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome will hopefully improve our

acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown.\n Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO.\n The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally.\n Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges.\n Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan.\n ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre.\n Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access.\n ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and

clinical characteristics of pneumonia patients coinfected with 2019 novel coronavirus and influenza virus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID?19) infection emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Since then the novel coronavirus pneumonia disease has been spreading quickly and many countries and territories have been affected, with major outbreaks in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran.\n Influenza virus has been known as a common pathogen in winter and it can cause pneumonia.\n It was found clinically that very few patients were diagnosed with both COVID?19 and influenza virus.\n A total of 5 of the 115 patients confirmed with COVID?19 were also diagnosed with influenza virus infection, with three cases being influenza A and two cases being influenza B.\n In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID?19 as well as influenza virus.\n Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (five [100%] patients), cough (five [100%] patients), shortness of breath (five [100%] patients), nasal tampon (three [60%] patients), pharyngalgia (three [60%] patients), myalgia (two [40%] patients), fatigue (two [40%] patients), headache (two [40%] patients), and expectoration (two [40%] patients).\n The laboratory results showed that compared to the normal values, the patients' lymphocytes were reduced (four [80%] patients), and liver functions alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (two [40%] patients and two [40%] patients) and C?reactive protein (four [80%] patients) were increased when admitted to hospital.\n They stayed in the hospital for 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4?±?7.02), respectively.\n The main complications for the patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (one [20%] patients), acute liver injury (three [60%] patients), and diarrhea (two [40%] patients).\n All patients were given antiviral therapy (including oseltamivir), oxygen inhalation, and antibiotics.\n Three patients were treated with glucocorticoids including two treated with oral glucocorticoids.\n One of the five patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis.\n Fortunately, all patients did not need intensive care unit and were discharged from the hospital without death.\n In conclusion, those patients with both COVID?19 and influenza virus infection did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory findings, imaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical characteristics as those patients with COVID?19 infection only.\n However, it is worth noting that the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia may be more prone to appear for those coinfection patients.\n","id":"PMC7228290","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qiang","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Panpan","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuhui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yujia","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mei","surname":"Liu","email":"fliumei@126.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30628-0","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19:

trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

Vitro Antiviral Activity and Projection of Optimized Dosing Design of Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","abstract":"Background\nThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.\n\n We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.\n\n\nConclusions\nHydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

observational cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally.\n\n Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0–16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China.\n\n We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 8·3 [SD 3·5] years) were identified to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures.\n\n 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]).\n\n Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]).\n\n Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38·5°C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37·5–38·5°C.\n\n Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]).\n\n Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB.\n\n All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir–ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation.\n\n Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days.\n\n By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAlthough all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.\n\n\nFunding\nNingbo Clinical Research Center for Children's Health and Diseases, Ningbo Reproductive Medicine Centre, and Key Scientific and Technological Innovation

analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively.\n\n The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients’ oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed.\n\n Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs.\n\n The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.\n\n\nResults:\nIn the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study.\n\n In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0–62.0) years were analyzed.\n\n After in-hospital treatment, patients’ inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition.\n\n The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0–11.0) days.\n\n By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients’ stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0–16.0) days after symptom onset.\n\n Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0–4.0) days.\n\n Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients’ urine specimens after throat swabs were negative.\n\n Using a multiple linear regression model (F?=?2.669, P?=?0.044, and adjusted R2?=?0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients’ stools (t?=??2.699, P?=?0.010).\n\n The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs.\n\n 8.0 days, respectively; t?=?2.550, P?=?0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs.\n\n 11 days, respectively; t?=?4.631, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P?&gt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions:\nIn brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients’ stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence.\n\n Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease.\n\n The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shui-Bao","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-Xiao","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Di","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Qin","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bi-Jie","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"En-Qiang","surname":"Mao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-Hong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong-Zhou","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection","abstract":"Background\nThe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus involved in cases and case clusters of severe acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK.\n\n We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification.\n\n We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes.\n\n\nFindings\nA 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid.\n\n Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2?×?106 copies per mL).\n\n Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay).\n\n One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL).\n\n No virus was detected in blood.\n\n The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation.\n\n The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union; German Centre for Infection Research; German Research Council; and German Ministry for

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

minimal to no symptoms underline the importance of identifying early or subclinical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) infection.\n\n Two such candidate symptoms include anecdotally reported loss of smell and taste.\n\n Understanding the timing and association of smell/taste loss in COVID?19 may help facilitate screening and early isolation of cases.\n\n\nMethods\nA single?institution, cross?sectional study evaluating patient?reported symptoms with a focus on smell and taste was conducted using an internet?based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for COVID?19. Logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with COVID?19 positivity.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 1480 patients with influenza?like symptoms underwent COVID?19 testing between March 3, 2020, and March 29, 2020. Our study captured 59 of 102 (58%) COVID?19–positive patients and 203 of 1378 (15%) COVID?19–negative patients.\n\n Smell and taste loss were reported in 68% (40/59) and 71% (42/59) of COVID?19–positive subjects, respectively, compared to 16% (33/203) and 17% (35/203) of COVID?19–negative patients (p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Smell and taste impairment were independently and strongly associated with COVID?19 positivity (anosmia: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.9; 95% CI, 5.08?23.5; ageusia: aOR 10.2; 95% CI, 4.74?22.1), whereas sore throat was associated with COVID?19 negativity (aOR 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11?0.50).\n\n Of patients who reported COVID?19–associated loss of smell, 74% (28/38) reported resolution of anosmia with clinical resolution of illness.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn ambulatory

to season of onset","abstract":"Background\nAcute viral upper respiratory tract infections are the most common cause of chronic olfactory dysfunction.\n\n In light of the seasonality of numerous viruses, the question arises as to whether the frequency and magnitude of postviral olfactory disorders (PVODs) are similarly seasonal.\n\n We sought to determine whether olfactory deficits due to influenza and non–influenza?related viruses (I?PVODs and NI?PVODs) vary in frequency or magnitude across seasons in a North American population and whether they are more prevalent or produce more severe olfactory dysfunction during colder months when host susceptibility may be increased.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective study of 587 patients presenting to an academic smell and taste center with either I?PVOD–related or NI?PVOD–related olfactory deficits.\n\n Chi?square and analysis of covariance (age = covariate) compared dysfunction prevalence frequencies and scores on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) across calendar months and between months with the coldest and warmest air temperatures.\n\n\nResults\nFor I?PVOD–related cases, both the prevalence and magnitude of smell dysfunction were highest in the colder months.\n\n However, for NI?PVOD–related cases, prevalence was higher in warmer months but, paradoxically, the magnitude of dysfunction was higher in colder months.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study shows that seasonal variations occur in both the prevalence and magnitude of PVOD?related olfactory deficits in a North American population, and that such variations differ between NI?PVOD and I?PVOD cases.\n\n The findings suggest multiple viruses are involved in producing PVOD?related olfactory deficits.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7262030","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mark

presence of cough, breathlessness, and fever; anecdotal reports suggested anosmia may also be a manifestation.\n\n We used Google Trends (GT) to investigate whether there was a surge in individuals searching for information related to smell loss during the COVID?19 epidemic in Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, Iran, and The Netherlands.\n\n\nMethods\nGT was used to explore internet activity related to loss of smell in the 8 aforementioned countries.\n\n Spearman rank analysis was performed to correlate loss?of?smell?relative search volumes (RSVs), with the increases of daily confirmed cases of COVID?19 and deaths attributed to disease.\n\n As a control event, we also performed analysis of smell?related searches during the last UK influenza epidemic of 2009.\nResults\nIn all 8 countries, we observed strong correlations between daily RSVs related to loss of smell, increases of daily COVID?19+ cases and deaths ranging from 0.633 to 0.952. All correlations were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n\nConclusion\nThere is a strong correlation between the frequency of searches for smell?related information and the onset of COVID?19 infection in Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran, and The Netherlands.\n\n We hypothesize this may relate to a previously underrecognized symptom.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7262261","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Abigail","surname":"Walker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claire","surname":"Hopkins","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pavol","surname":"Surda","email":"pavol.surda@gstt.nhs.uk","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.1127","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Neurologic Manifestations of Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"  . https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms-and-what-to-do/.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU

smell and/or taste disorders (STDs) with increased frequency.\n\n The aim was to determine whether new?onset STDs are more frequent amongst COVID?19 patients than influenza patients.\n\n\nMethod\nThis was a case–control study including hospitalized patients of two tertiary care centres.\n\n Consecutive patients positive for COVID?19 polymerase chain reaction (cases) and patients positive for influenza polymerase chain reaction (historical control sample) were assessed during specific periods, employing a self?reported STD questionnaire.\n\n\nResults\nSeventy?nine cases and 40 controls were included.\n\n No significant differences were found in basal features between the two groups.\n\n New?onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst cases (31, 39.2%) than in the control group (5, 12.5 %) [adjusted odds ratio 21.4 (2.77–165.4, P = 0.003)].\n\n COVID?19 patients with new?onset STDs were significantly younger than COVID?19 patients without STDs (52.6 ± 17.2 vs.\n\n 67.4 ± 15.1, P &lt; 0.001).\n\n Amongst COVID?19 patients who presented STDs, 22 (70.9%) recalled an acute onset and it was an initial manifestation in 11 (35.5%).\n\n Twenty?five (80.6%) presented smell disorders (mostly anosmia, 14, 45.2%) and 28 (90.3%) taste disorders (mostly ageusia, 14, 45.2%).\n\n Only four (12.9 %) reported concomitant nasal obstruction.\n\n The mean duration of STD was 7.5 ± 3.2 days and 12 patients (40%) manifested complete recovery after 7.4 ± 2.3 days of onset.\n\n\nConclusion\nNew?onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst COVID?19 patients than influenza patients; they usually had an acute onset and were commonly an initial manifestation.\n\n The use of STD assessment in anamnesis as a hint for COVID?19 and to support individuals’ self?isolation in the current epidemic context is suggested.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7264557","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Á.","surname":"Beltrán?Corbellini","email":"beltran_corbellini@hotmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

Evaluation of the Olfactory Function: European Multicenter Study on 774 COVID-19 Patients","abstract":"Background: The objective evaluation of the olfactory function of coronavirus disease 2019 patients is difficult because of logistical and operator-safety problems.\n For this reason, in the literature, the data obtained from psychophysical tests are few and based on small case series.\n Methods: A multicenter, cohort study conducted in seven European hospitals between March 22 and August 20, 2020. The Sniffin-Sticks test and the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center orthonasal olfaction test were used to objectively evaluate the olfactory function.\n Results: This study included 774 patients, of these 481 (62.1%) presented olfactory dysfunction (OD): 280 were hyposmic and 201 were anosmic.\n There was a significant difference between self-reported anosmia/hyposmia and psychophysical test results (p = 0.006).\n Patients with gastroesophageal disorders reported a significantly higher probability of presenting hyposmia (OR 1.86; p = 0.015) and anosmia (OR 2.425; p &lt; 0.001).\n Fever, chest pain, and phlegm significantly increased the likelihood of having hyposmia but not anosmia or an olfactory disturbance.\n In contrast, patients with dyspnea, dysphonia, and severe-to-critical COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have no anosmia, while these symptoms had no effect on the risk of developing hyposmia or an OD.\n Conclusions: Psychophysical assessment represents a significantly more accurate assessment tool for olfactory function than patient self-reported clinical outcomes.\n Olfactory disturbances appear to be largely independent from the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the patients.\n The non-association with rhinitis symptoms and the high prevalence as a presenting symptom make olfactory disturbances an important

differences in chemosensitive recovery were detected based on age and distance from the onset of clinical manifestations.\n\n\nConclusion\nOlfactory and gustatory dysfunctions represent common clinical findings in COVID?19 patients.\n\n Otolaryngologists and head?neck surgeons must by now keep this diagnostic option in mind when evaluating cases of ageusia and nonspecific anosmia that arose suddenly and are not associated with rhinitis symptoms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7267244","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Luigi

sources\nPubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and medRxiv from inception to 3 October 2021.\nReview methods\nTwo blinded reviewers selected observational studies of adults (?18 years) with covid-19 related dysfunction of smell or taste.\n\n Descriptive prognosis studies with time-to-event curves and prognostic association studies of any prognostic factor were included.\n\n\nData extraction and synthesis\nTwo reviewers extracted data, evaluated study bias using QUIPS, and appraised evidence quality using GRADE, following PRISMA and MOOSE reporting guidelines.\n\n Using iterative numerical algorithms, time-to-event individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed and pooled to retrieve distribution-free summary survival curves, with recovery rates reported at 30 day intervals for participants who remained alive.\n\n To estimate the proportion with persistent smell and taste dysfunction, cure fractions from Weibull non-mixture cure models of plateaued survival curves were logit transformed and pooled in a two stage meta-analysis.\n\n Conventional aggregate data meta-analysis was performed to explore unadjusted associations of prognostic factors with recovery.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nThe primary outcomes were the proportions of patients remaining with smell or taste dysfunction.\n\n Secondary outcomes were the odds ratios of prognostic variables associated with recovery of smell and taste.\n\n\nResults\n18 studies (3699 patients) from 4180 records were included in reconstructed IPD meta-analyses.\n\n Risk of bias was low to moderate; conclusions remained unaltered after exclusion of four high risk studies.\n\n Evidence quality was moderate to high.\n\n Based on parametric cure modelling, persistent self-reported smell and taste dysfunction could develop in an estimated 5.6% (95% confidence interval 2.7% to 11.0%, I2=70%, ?2=0.756, 95% prediction interval 0.7% to 33.5%) and 4.4% (1.2% to 14.6%, I2=67%, ?2=0.684, 95%

sense of smell (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.37 to 0.72, seven studies, I2=20%, ?2=0.0224) and taste (0.31, 0.13 to 0.72, seven studies, I2=78%, ?2=0.5121) than men, and patients with

(1/60; 2%).\n\n Deficits were evident for all 40 UPSIT odorants.\n\n No meaningful relationships between the test scores and sex, disease severity, or comorbidities were found.\n\n\nConclusion\nQuantitative smell testing demonstrates that decreased smell function, but not always anosmia, is a major marker for SARS?CoV?2 infection and suggests the possibility that smell testing may help, in some cases, to identify COVID?19 patients in need of early treatment or quarantine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7262123","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shima T.","surname":"Moein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Seyed

epidemiological, clinical and immunological characteristics of patients and the persistence of OD at 60 days.\n\n\nMethods\nCOVID?19 positive patients presenting OD were prospectively recruited from three European hospitals.\n\n Baseline clinical and olfactory evaluations were performed within the first 2 weeks after OD onset and repeated at 30 and 60 days.\n\n In a subgroup of patients, anti?severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2) antibodies were measured in serum, saliva and nasal secretions at 60 days.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 288 COVID?19 patients with OD were included in the study.\n\n Two weeks after the onset of the loss of smell, 52.4% of patients had OD on psychophysical tests, including 113 cases (39.2%) of anosmia and 38 cases (13.2%) of hyposmia.\n\n At 60?day follow?up, 25.4% of the patients presented persistent OD.\n\n There was no significant correlation between sex, age, viral load on nasopharyngeal swab or COVID?19 severity and poor olfactory outcome.\n\n In a subgroup of 63 patients, it was demonstrated that patients with poor olfactory outcomes at 60 days had lower levels of salivary and nasal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG1, but similar levels of antibodies in the serum.\n\n\nConclusions\nNo clinical markers predicted the evolution of OD at 60 days.\n\n Patients with poor olfactory outcome at 60 days had lower saliva and nasal antibodies, suggesting a role for local immune responses in the persistence of COVID?19 related OD.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8444937","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sven","surname":"Saussez","email":"Sven.saussez@umons.ac.be","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shilpee","surname":"Sharma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shilpee","surname":"Sharma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anaïs","surname":"Thiriard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Véronique","surname":"Olislagers","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Inès","surname":"Vu

SARS-CoV-2 appears equally, or even more, infectious for the olfactory epithelium (OE) than for the respiratory epithelium in the nasal cavity.\n In light of the small area of the OE relative to the respiratory epithelium, the high prevalence of olfactory dysfunctions (ODs) in COVID-19 has been bewildering and has attracted much attention.\n This review aims to first examine the cytological and molecular biological characteristics of the OE, especially the microvillous apical surfaces of sustentacular cells and the abundant SARS-CoV-2 receptor molecules thereof, that may underlie the high susceptibility of this neuroepithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection and damages.\n The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, or the lack of it, is then analyzed with regard to the expression of the receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) or priming protease (transmembrane serine protease 2), and cellular targets of infection.\n Neuropathology of COVID-19 in the OE, olfactory bulb, and other related neural structures are also reviewed.\n Toward the end, we present our perspectives regarding possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis and ODs, in the absence of substantial viral infection of neurons.\n Plausible causes for persistent ODs in some COVID-19 convalescents are also examined.\n","id":"PMC8625547","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fengyi","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"De

or nasal corticosteroids (NC) as an add-on to olfactory training (OT) versus OT alone in patients with olfactory dysfunction (OD) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n Methods: Patients with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 and OD were prospectively recruited from March 22 to December 15, 2020 from 4 European hospitals.\n Patients had confirmed OD on psychophysical testing.\n All patients undertook OT, with add-on 10 days of OC (group 1: OC + OT), or 1 month of NC (group 2: NC + OT) or olfactory training alone (group 3: OT).\n Olfactory evaluations (Sniffin’Sticks tests) were carried out at the time of inclusion, 1 and 2 months after the start of the therapeutic course.\n Results: A total of 152 hyposmic or anosmic patients completed the study.\n Group 1, 2 and 3 included 59, 22 and 71 patients, respectively and all patient groups were comparable regarding baseline Sniffin’Sticks tests.\n The median Sniffin’Sticks test values significantly improved from pre- to post-intervention in all groups.\n The increase of Sniffin’Sticks test values was higher in group 1 (OC + OT) compared with groups 2 and 3 (p &lt; 0.001) at one month after treatment but did not remain so at 2 months.\n Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, presented parosmia in 20/71 (28.2%), 9/22 (40.9%) and 42/71 (59.2%) patients.\n This difference was statistically significant between group 1 and 3 (p &lt; 0.001).\n There were no patients with a worsening of the disease or an increase of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms.\n Conclusions: The use of OCs in patients with OD related to mild COVID-19 is generally well-tolerated without any case of deterioration of symptoms.\n OC is associated with greater improvement in psychophysical olfactory evaluations at 1-month post-treatment but there was no difference at 2 months.\n Parosmia may be reduced following treatment with OC and NC.\n On the basis of these preliminary results, it is possible to state that considering the 2 months efficacy of OC and NC with respect to the OT alone and the risk-benefit ratio, the benefit to start a specific treatment of COVID-19 related OD cannot be demonstrated and there is a need for a randomised controlled trial to assess this further.\n","id":"PMC8228154","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sven","surname":"Saussez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luigi

Aims: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR?) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of using GD as a triage symptom prior to RT-PCR.\n Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched up to 20 June 2021.

virus.\n In the present study, we therefore tested the olfactory threshold coupled with heart–lung parameters in subjects undergoing traditional molecular testing, resulting in a significantly different score between asymptomatic subjects and healthy controls.\n In total, 82% of asymptomatic positives showed olfactory impairment; of these, 46% had severe hyposmia and 7% had anosmia, while in the control 9% had severe hyposmia and 0% had anosmia, respectively, which agrees with heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure parameter variations.\n The olfactory test coupled with

manuscript, we report the cross-sectional data (first assessment) of a longitudinal study (6-month follow-up) examining smell, taste, and chemesthesis in participants affected by long-term COVID-19 (COVID+) and participants without COVID-19 (COVID?) by means of both self-reported and direct psychophysical methods.\n In total, 208 Italian participants (COVID+ n = 133; COVID? n = 75) completed the Smell and Taste Check developed by the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research (GCCR), which includes self-reports on smell, taste, and chemesthetic abilities as well as direct intensity ratings of unstandardized smell, taste, and chemesthetic household items.\n Furthermore, all participants completed SCENTinel, a validated direct smell test.\n We found a positive association between the self-reported, unstandardized direct test and the validated direct test for smell, indicating moderate to large agreement across measures.\n Furthermore, the performance on SCENTinel was significantly associated with self-reported smell loss.\n A positive association between the self-reports and the intensity of household items was also retrieved for taste and chemesthesis.\n The time relative to COVID-19 onset (267.3 ± 113.9 days) did not modulate the chemosensory performance of self-reported abilities, intensity ratings, and SCENTinel.\n All in all, we confirm the impairment of three chemical senses (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) in an independent sample of Italian participants affected by long-term COVID-19 by using and comparing self-reported and direct psychophysical

Different therapeutic options, including mometasone nasal spray, have been recommended, only some of which have been validated for post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction.\n In this study we psychophysically assessed the effect of intranasally applied mometasone furoate on the recovery of olfaction.\n The spray was applied with a long applicator so that the olfactory cleft could be reached effectively.\n After olfactory dysfunction had been confirmed psychophysically using Sniffin’ Sticks, patients were randomly assigned to two different treatment arms: the study group (n = 40) underwent olfactory training and intranasal administration of mometasone furoate twice daily, whereas the control group (n = 46) performed olfactory training only.\n After a study duration of three months, psychophysical testing of olfaction was repeated using Sniffin’ Sticks.\n We found no benefit of an additional topical administration of mometasone furoate compared to olfactory training alone.\n These results psychophysically confirm two previous studies which were based on patients’ subjective self-ratings.\n Our findings are in contrast to current recommendations for the management of olfactory dysfunction post-COVID-19, which might have to be adapted accordingly.\n","id":"PMC9605508","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Constantin

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

for SARS?CoV and MERS?CoV.\n The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID?19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously.\n Additionally, some patients with COVID?19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases.\n The infection of SARS?CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected.\n Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse?connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways.\n Considering the high similarity between SARS?CoV and SARS?CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS?CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID?19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS?CoV?2?induced respiratory failure.\n","id":"PMC7228394","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan?Chao","surname":"Li","email":"liyanchao@jlu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tsutomu","surname":"Hashikawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.22.20026500","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Neurological manifestations of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective case series study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.3786","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in different types of clinical specimens","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

study","abstract":"Background\nWhile the leading symptoms during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are acute and the majority of patients fully recover, a significant fraction of patients now increasingly experience long-term health consequences.\n\n However, most data available focus on health-related events after severe infection and hospitalisation.\n\n We present a longitudinal, prospective analysis of health consequences in patients who initially presented with no or minor symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n\n Hence, we focus on mild COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients.\n\n\nMethods\n958 Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed from April 6th to December 2nd 2020 for long-term symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.\n\n We identified anosmia, ageusia, fatigue or shortness of breath as most common, persisting symptoms at month 4 and 7 and summarised presence of such long-term health consequences as post-COVID syndrome (PCS).\n\n Predictors of long-term symptoms were assessed using an uni- and multivariable logistic regression model.\n\n\nFindings\nWe observed 442 and 353 patients over four and seven months after symptom onset, respectively.\n\n Four months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8•6% (38/442) of patients presented with shortness of breath, 12•4% (55/442) with anosmia, 11•1% (49/442) with ageusia and 9•7% (43/442) with fatigue.\n\n At least one of these characteristic symptoms was present in 27•8% (123/442) and 34•8% (123/353) at month 4 and 7 post-infection, respectively.\n\n A lower baseline level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, anosmia and diarrhoea during acute COVID-19 were associated with higher risk to develop long-term symptoms.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe on-going presence of either shortness of breath, anosmia, ageusia or fatigue as long-lasting symptoms even in non-hospitalised patients was observed at four and seven months post-infection and summarised as post-COVID syndrome (PCS).\n\n The continued assessment of patients with PCS will become a major task to define and mitigate the socioeconomic and medical long-term effects of COVID-19.\nFunding\nCOVIM:“NaFoUniMedCovid19”(FKZ:

The COVID?19 disease severity varies among individuals, depending on fluctuating symptoms.\n Many infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and dengue hemorrhagic fever have been associated with ABO blood groups.\n The aim of this study was to explore whether ABO blood groups might serve as a risk or a protective factor for COVID?19 infection.\n Moreover, the symptomatic variations of COVID?19 infection among the individuals with different blood groups were also analyzed.\n An online questionnaire?based survey was conducted in which 305 partakers were included, who had successfully recovered from coronavirus infection.\n The ABO blood groups of 1294 healthy individuals were also taken as a control.\n The results of the current study demonstrated that antibody A containing blood groups (blood group B, p?value: 0.049 and blood group O, p?value: 0.289) had a protective role against COVID?19 infection.\n The comparison of symptomatic variations among COVID?19?infected subjects showed that blood group O subjects had lower chances of experiencing severe symptoms relating to respiratory distress, while subjects with AB blood group were more prone to develop symptoms, but the differences in both groups were found to be statistically non?significant.\n In conclusion, subjects who do not have anti?A antibodies in their serum (i.\ne.\n, subjects with group A and AB) are more likely to be infected with COVID?19.

respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2).\n\n It spreads very rapidly and can result in severe acute respiratory failure.\n\n The clinical studies have shown that advanced age and chronic diseases increase the risk of infection.\n\n However, influence of the blood groups on COVID-19 infection and its outcome remains to be confirmed.\n\n The aim of this study is to investigate whether there exists a relationship between the blood groups of the patients and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.\n\n\nMaterial and method\n186 patients with PCR confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in this study.\n\n Age, sex, blood groups, comorbidities, need for intubation and intensive care unit follow up and mortalities of the patients were analyzed retrospectively.\n\n 1881 healthy individuals, who presented to the Hacettepe University Blood Bank served as the controls.\n\n\nResults\n The most frequently detected blood group was blood group A (57%) amongst the COVID-19 patients.\n\n This was followed by blood group O (24.8%).\n\n The blood group types did not affect the clinical outcomes.\n\n The blood group A was statistically

have a role in increased susceptibility to the COVID-19 infection, the blood group O might be somewhat protective.\n\n However, once infected, blood group type does not seem to influence clinical

Blood type O is mostly associated with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while blood type A is frequently described as a risk factor.\n Although results regarding the risk of severe outcomes are more variable, blood type A is the most associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality, while many studies describe O blood type as a protective factor for the disease progression.\n Furthermore, genetic associations with both the risk of infection and disease severity have been reported for the ABO locus.\n Some underlying mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain the reported associations, with incipient experimental data.\n Three major hypotheses emerge: SARS-CoV-2 could carry ABO(H)-like structures in its envelope glycoproteins and would be asymmetrically transmitted due to a protective effect of the ABO antibodies, ABH antigens could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the host’ cells, and the association of non-O blood types with higher risks of thromboembolic events could confer COVID-19 patients with blood type O a lower risk of severe outcomes.\n The hypothesized mechanisms would affect distinct aspects of the COVID-19 natural history, with distinct potential implications to the disease transmission and its management.\n","id":"PMC9233352","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Pereira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stela","surname":"Felipe","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Raquel","surname":"de Freitas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Valdevane","surname":"Araújo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paula","surname":"Soares","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jannison","surname":"Ribeiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luiz","surname":"Henrique dos Santos","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juliana Osório","surname":"Alves","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Natália","surname":"Canabrava","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mauricio","surname":"van Tilburg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria Izabel","surname":"Guedes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vânia","surname":"Ceccatto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/infdis/jiaa660","date":"2020-10-14","title":"Associations Between Genetically Predicted Protein Levels and COVID-19 Severity","abstract":"It is critical to identify potential causal targets for SARS-CoV-2, which may guide drug repurposing options.\n We assessed the associations between genetically predicted protein levels and COVID-19 severity.\n Leveraging data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative comparing 6492 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 1 012 809 controls, we identified 18 proteins with genetically predicted levels to be associated with COVID-19 severity at a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05, including 12 that showed an association even after Bonferroni correction.\n Of the 18 proteins, 6 showed positive associations and 12 showed inverse associations.\n In conclusion, we identified 18 candidate proteins for COVID-19 severity.\n","id":"PMC7797748","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jingjing","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lang","surname":"Wu","email":"lwu@cc.hawaii.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1053/j.semvascsurg.2021.05.005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Relationship between blood type and outcomes following COVID-19 infection","abstract":"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a concentrated research effort has been undertaken to elucidate risk factors underlying viral infection, severe illness, and death.\n Recent studies have investigated the association between blood type and COVID-19 infection.\n This article aims to comprehensively review current literature and better understand the impact of blood type on viral susceptibility and outcomes.\n","id":"PMC8286549","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Young","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher A.","surname":"Latz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charles S.","surname":"DeCarlo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sujin","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"C.

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant

and the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in cohort studies.\n\n\nMethods\nThe PA28? expression level was assessed by immunohistochemistry in a total of 368 OSCC patients from three independent cohorts.\n\n The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine multivariate hazard ratios for Overall Survival (OS).\n\n Model discrimination was measured using C Statistic.\n\n Additionally, OS was analyzed in Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set.\n\n Functional analyses were conducted both in-vitro and in-vivo.\n\n\nFindings\nThe median follow-up times of patients in the three studies were 60, 52, and 51 months.\n\n High expression of PA28? was identified in tumors from 179 of 368 patients (48.6%).\n\n Compared with low expression, high expression of PA28? was strongly associated with worse OS, with relative risks of 5.14 (95% CI, 2.51–10.5; P &lt; 0.001), 2.82 (95% CI, 1.73–4.61; P &lt; 0.001), and 3.85 (95% CI, 1.59–9.37; P = 0.003).\n\n PA28? expression was also associated with disease-free survival in all three cohorts (P &lt; 0.005).\n\n These findings are consistent with TCGA HNSCC data (P &lt; 0.006).\n\n The prediction of all-cause mortality was significantly improved when PA28? was added to the traditional clinical factors (Model 3, C statistic value: 0.78 VS 0.73, P = 0.016).\n\n In functional analyses, we found that PA28? silencing dramatically inhibited the growth, proliferation and mobility of OSCC cells in vitro and reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis in tumor-bearing mice.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPA28? overexpression is associated with adverse prognosis in patients with OSCC.\n\n The aberrant expression of PA28? may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of OSCC.\n\n\nResearch in context\nOSCC is one of the most common HNSCC, which have a high lethally rate.\n\n However, few prognostic markers have been applied in the clinical practice.\n\n We found that PA28? in OSCC tumor tissues were significantly high expression than those in normal tissues.\n\n As the results of the three cohorts from two independent research centers and from an additional validation cohort from a US population in the TCGA dataset, we demonstrate PA28? is a good predictor of the risk of death in OSCC.\n\n Meanwhile, we demonstrate PA28? have a potential role in OSCC tumorigenesis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4563126","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaodong","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chongkun","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Zeng","email":"zengxin22@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hao","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Taiwen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruinan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xikun","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongxia","surname":"Dan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Ji","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ga","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dunfang","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yunfeng","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinhua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Longjiang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi","surname":"Wang","email":"wangzhi0506@vip.163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianming","surname":"Chen","email":"qmchen@scu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ejca.2008.11.012","date":"1970-01-01","title":"RACK1, an excellent predictor for poor clinical outcome in oral squamous carcinoma, similar to Ki67","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Forrest, A.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in

Although 2019-nCoV can cause a severe respiratory illness like SARS and MERS, evidence from clinics suggested that 2019-nCoV is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, and much less than MERS-CoV.\n The transmissibility of 2019-nCoV is still debated and needs to be further assessed.\n To avoid the 2019-nCoV outbreak turning into an epidemic or even a pandemic and to minimize the mortality rate, China activated emergency response procedures, but much remains to be learned about the features of the virus to refine the risk assessment and response.\n Here, the current knowledge in 2019-nCoV pathogenicity and transmissibility is summarized in comparison with several commonly known emerging viruses, and information urgently needed for a better control of the disease is highlighted.\n","id":"PMC7102641","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jieliang","surname":"Chen","email":"jieliangchen@fudan.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the 2003 Hong Kong epidemic: an analysis of all 1755 patients","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Notice on issuing a new coronavirus infected pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (Trial Version 5)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.7326/M20-0533","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Histopathologic Changes and SARS–CoV-2 Immunostaining in the Lung of a Patient With COVID-19","abstract":"","id":"PMC7081173","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Huilan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanqiu","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huihui","surname":"Yue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tanze","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chengqing","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangyun","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xianxiang","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huiguo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cong-Yi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1585","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was

virus detection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.\n\n To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5?×?104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2?×?104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by

important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be

consortium of nine European laboratories to encompass associated partners in Africa, Russia, China, Turkey, Germany and Italy.\n In 2014, the H2020 Research and Innovation Framework Programme (INFRAS projects) provided support for the transformation of the EVA from a European to a global organization (EVAg).\n The EVAg now operates as a non-profit consortium, with 26 partners and 20 associated partners from 21 EU and non-EU countries.\n In this paper, we outline the structure, management and goals of the EVAg, to bring to the attention of researchers the wealth of products it can provide

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and
