75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 7.86; 95% CI, 2.44-25.35), age between 65 and 74 years (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.24-9.5), coronary heart disease (HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 1.14-16.13), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.07-8.94), dyspnea (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.42-11), procalcitonin level &gt; 0.5 ng/mL (HR, 8.72; 95% CI, 3.42-22.28), and aspartate aminotransferase level &gt; 40 U/L (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-6.73) were independent risk factors associated with fatal outcome.\n\n A nomogram was established based on the results of multivariate analysis.\n\n The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram has sufficient discriminatory power with a C-index of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.97).\n\n The calibration plots also showed good consistency between the prediction and the observation.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe proposed nomogram accurately predicted clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics.\n\n Earlier identification, more intensive surveillance, and appropriate therapy should be considered in patients at high risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158802","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ruchong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Wenhua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Mei","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Weijie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Chen","surname":"Zhan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Chunli","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ling","surname":"Sang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jiaxing","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Zhengyi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Chunliang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yixiang","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Li","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yahua","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Peng","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jianming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jiyang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Zhong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Gang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Zhijian","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Shaoqin","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jie","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Changjiang","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Shaoyong","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Xiaoqing","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Linling","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Feng","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jinping","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Nuofu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yimin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jianxing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Shiyue","surname":"Li","email":"lishiyue@188.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Nanshan","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"                           NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report-72","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Rolling updates on coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaolin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xingwang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuelei","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangfa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongmeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Wang","email":"wangjw28@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"caobin_ben@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

a major threat to public health13.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward

a severe respiratory disease in humans in the Middle East.\n\n The epidemiological profiles of the MERS-CoV infections suggest zoonotic transmission from an animal reservoir to humans.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study was designed to investigate animal herds associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-infected patients in Saudi Arabia, during the last three years (20142016).\n\n Nasal swabs and serum samples from 584 dromedary camels, 39 sheep, 51 goats, and 2 cattle were collected.\n\n Nasal samples from camels, sheep, goats, and cattle were examined by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect MERS-CoV RNA, and the Anti-MERS ELISA assay was performed to detect camel humeral immune response (IgG) to MERS-CoV S1 antigen infection.\n\n The complete genome sequencing of ten MERS-CoV camel isolates and phylogenetic analysis was performed.\n\n\nResults\nThe data indicated that seventy-five dromedary camels were positive for MERS-CoV RNA; the virus was not detected in sheep, goats, and cattle.\n\n MERS-CoV RNA from infected camels was not detected beyond 2 weeks after the first positive result was detected in nasal swabs obtained from infected camels.\n\n Anti-MERS ELISA assays showed that 70.9% of camels related to human cases had antibodies to MERS-CoV.\n\n The full genome sequences of the ten MERS-CoV camel isolates were identical to their corresponding patients and were grouped together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster for human and camel isolates reported form the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings indicate that camels are a significant reservoir for the maintenance of MERS-CoVs, and they are an important source of human infection with MERS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102853","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Samy","surname":"Kasem","email":"samy_kasem1976@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ibraheem","surname":"Qasim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ali","surname":"Al-Hufofi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Osman","surname":"Hashim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ali","surname":"Alkarar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ali","surname":"Abu-Obeida","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Albagir","surname":"Gaafer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abdelhamid","surname":"Elfadil","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ahmed","surname":"Zaki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ahmed","surname":"Al-Romaihi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nasereldeen","surname":"Babekr","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nadr","surname":"El-Harby","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Raed","surname":"Hussien","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ali","surname":"AL-Sahaf","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ali","surname":"Al-Doweriej","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Faisal","surname":"Bayoumi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leo

Subsequent contact investigations revealed a fourth-generation transmission.\n\n Only 7 (4.5%) of the total 153 contacts were positive for MERS-CoV.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission is complex.\n\n Although most MERS-CoVinfected HCWs are asymptomatic or have mild disease, fatal infections can occur and HCWs can play a major role in propagating health care facility outbreaks.\n\n This investigation highlights the need to continuously review infection control guidance relating to the role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission in health care outbreaks, especially as it relates to the complex questions on definition of risky exposures, who to test, and the frequency of MERS-CoV testing; criteria for who to quarantine and for how long; and clearance and return to active duty criteria.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7115310","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sarah H.","surname":"Alfaraj","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jaffar A.","surname":"Al-Tawfiq","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Talal A.","surname":"Altuwaijri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marzouqa","surname":"Alanazi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nojoom","surname":"Alzahrani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ziad A.","surname":"Memish","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk factors for transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection during the 2015 outbreak in South Korea","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Environmental contamination and viral shedding in MERS patients during MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of spreaders of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus during the 2015 outbreak in Korea","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Extensive viable Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus contamination in air and surrounding environment in MERS isolation wards","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections in healthcare settings, Abu Dhabi","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"MERS-CoV outbreak following a single patient exposure in an emergency room in South Korea: an epidemiological outbreak study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WHO MERS-CoV global summary and assessment of risk","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk factors for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection among healthcare personnel","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nosocomial amplification of MERS-coronavirus in South Korea, 2015","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jhin.2017.09.017","date":"2017-09-20","title":"High reproduction number of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in nosocomial outbreaks: mathematical modelling in Saudi Arabia and South Korea","abstract":"Background\nEffective countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases require an understanding of transmission rate and basic reproduction number (R0).\n\n R0 for severe acute respiratory syndrome is generally considered to be &gt;1, whereas that for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is considered to be &lt;1.

pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

are gender related, with more symptoms in males than in females.\n\n However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.\n\n In this study, we investigated sex differences in renal vascular responses to angiotensin II (Ang II) administration with and without Ang II type 1 and Mas receptor (AT1R and MasR) antagonists (losartan and A779) in the 2K1C rat model of renovascular hypertension.\n\n \nMethods\n Male and female 2K1C rats were divided into 8 experimental groups (4 of each sex) treated with vehicle, losartan, A779, or A779+losartan.\n\n Responses of mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal blood flow (RBF), and renal vascular resistance (RVR) to Ang II were determined.\n\n \nResults\n In both sexes, the basal MAP, RBF, and RVR were not significantly different between the four groups during the control period.\n\n The Ang II administration decreased RBF and increased RVR in a dose-related manner in both sexes pretreated with vehicle or A779 (Pdose &lt; 0.0001), but in vehicle pretreated groups, RBF and RVR responses were different between male and female rats (Pgroup &lt; 0.05).\n\n AT1R blockade increased RBF and decreased RVR responses to Ang II, and no difference between the sexes was detected.\n\n Coblockades of AT1R and MasR receptors increased RBF response to Ang II significantly in males alone but not in females (Pgroup=0.04).\n\n \nConclusion\n The impact of Ang II on RBF and RVR responses seems to be gender related with a greater effect on males, and this sex difference abolishes by Mas receptor blockade.\n\n However, the paradoxical role of dual losartan and A779 may provide the different receptor interaction in RAS between male and female rats.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7914082","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zahra","surname":"Pezeshki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mehdi","surname":"Nematbakhsh","email":"nematbakhsh@med.mui.ac.ir","contributions":"6"},{"firstname":"Mehdi","surname":"Nematbakhsh","email":"nematbakhsh@med.mui.ac.ir","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1113/jphysiol.2001.012921","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Differential

vasodilatation.\n However, the effects of supraphysiological levels of estrogen, analogous to those achieved with high-dose estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, remain unknown.\n Therefore, we pretreated ovariectomized rats with a relatively high dose of estrogen (0.5?mg/kg/week) for two weeks.\n Subsequently, renal hemodynamic responses to intravenous angiotensin II (Ang II, 30300?ng/kg/min) were tested under anesthesia, while renal perfusion pressure was held constant.\n The role of AT2R was examined by pretreating groups of rats with PD123319 or its vehicle.\n Renal blood flow (RBF) decreased in a dose-related manner in response to Ang II.\n Responses to Ang II were enhanced by pretreatment with estradiol.\n For example, at 300?ng?kg?1?min?1, Ang II reduced RBF by 45.7 ± 1.9% in estradiol-treated rats but only by 27.3 ± 5.1% in vehicle-treated rats.\n Pretreatment with PD123319 blunted the response of RBF to Ang II in estradiol-treated rats, so that reductions in RBF were similar to those in rats not treated with estradiol.\n We conclude that supraphysiological levels of estrogen promote AT2R-mediated renal vasoconstriction.\n This mechanism could potentially contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with hormone replacement therapy using high-dose estrogen.\n

vehicle did not alter mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal perfusion pressure (RPP), and renal blood flow (RBF).\n\n However, in non-2K1C rats, Ang II infusion decreased RBF and increased renal vascular resistance (RVR) responses in a dose-related manner (Ptreat &lt; 0.0001).\n\n The greatest responses were found in ovariectomized estradiol-treated rats that received A779 (Pgroup &lt; 0.05) in non-2K1C rats.\n\n Such findings were not detected in 2K1C hypertensive rats.\n\n For example, in estradiol-treated rats that received A779, at 1000?ng/kg/min of Ang II infusion, RBF reduced from 1.6 ± 0.2 to 0.89 ± 0.19?ml/min in non-2K1C rats, and it reduced from 1.6 ± 0.2 to 1.2 ± 0.2?ml/min in 2K1C rats.\n\n \nConclusion\n Hypertension induced by 2K1C may attenuate the role of A779 and estradiol in renal vascular responses to Ang II infusion.\n\n Perhaps, this response can be explained by the reduction of Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression in the 2K1C hypertensive rats.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7943267","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Samira","surname":"Choopani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mehdi","surname":"Nematbakhsh","email":"nematbakhsh@med.mui.ac.ir","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mehdi","surname":"Nematbakhsh","email":"nematbakhsh@med.mui.ac.ir","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1155/2015/801053","date":"2015-08-12","title":"Role

Percentage change of RBF (%RBF) in response to Ang1-7 infusion increased in a dose-dependent manner.\n In the presence of BK, when MasR was not blocked, %RBF response to Ang 1-7 in OVE group was

converting enzyme (ACE)2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a new complex target for a pharmacological intervention.\n We investigated the expression of RAS components in the heart and kidney during the development of hypertension and its perinatal treatment with losartan in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).\n Expressions of RAS genes were studied by the RT-PCR in the left ventricle and kidney of rats: normotensive Wistar, untreated SHR, SHR treated with losartan since perinatal period until week 9 of age (20 mg/kg/day) and SHR treated with losartan only until week 4 of age and discontinued until week 9. In the hypertrophied left ventricle of SHR, cardiac expressions of Ace and Mas were decreased while those of AT1 receptor (Agtr1a) and Ace2 were unchanged.\n Continuous losartan administration reduced LV weight (0.43 ± 0.02; P &lt; 0.05 versus SHR) but did not influence altered cardiac RAS expression.\n Increased blood pressure in SHR (149 ± 2 in SHR versus 109 ± 2 mmHg in Wistar; P &lt; 0.05) was associated with a lower renal expressions of renin, Agtr1a and Mas and with an increase in ACE2. Continuous losartan administration lowered blood pressure to control levels (105 ± 3 mmHg; P &lt; 0.05 versus SHR), however, only renal renin and ACE2 were significantly up-regulated (for both P &lt; 0.05 versus SHR).\n Conclusively, prevention of hypertension and LV hypertrophy development by losartan was unrelated to cardiac or renal expression of Mas.\n Increased renal Ace2, and its further increase by losartan suggests the influence of locally generated Ang-(1-7) in organ response to the developing hypertension in
