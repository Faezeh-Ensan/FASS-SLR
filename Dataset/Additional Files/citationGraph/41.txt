This resource continues to be developed in conjunction with the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) and the British Pharmacological Society (BPS).\n\n As previously described, our unique model of content selection and quality control is based on 96 target-class subcommittees comprising 512 scientists collaborating with in-house curators.\n\n This update describes content expansion, new features and interoperability improvements introduced in the 10 releases since August 2015. Our relationship matrix now describes ?9000 ligands, ?15 000 binding constants, ?6000 papers and ?1700 human proteins.\n\n As an important addition, we also introduce our newly funded project for the Guide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY (GtoImmuPdb, www.\n\nguidetoimmunopharmacology.\n\norg).\n\n This has been ‘forked’ from the well-established GtoPdb data model and expanded into new types of data related to the immune system and inflammatory processes.\n\n This includes new ligands, targets, pathways, cell types and diseases for which we are recruiting new IUPHAR expert committees.\n\n Designed as an immunopharmacological gateway, it also has an emphasis on potential therapeutic interventions.\n\n","id":"PMC5753190","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Simon D","surname":"Harding","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joanna L","surname":"Sharman","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Joanna L","surname":"Sharman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elena","surname":"Faccenda","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chris","surname":"Southan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Adam J","surname":"Pawson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Ireland","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alasdair J G","surname":"Gray","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liam","surname":"Bruce","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephen P H","surname":"Alexander","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Anderton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Clare","surname":"Bryant","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anthony P","surname":"Davenport","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Doerig","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Doriano","surname":"Fabbro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francesca","surname":"Levi-Schaffer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Spedding","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jamie A","surname":"Davies","email":"jamie.davies@ed.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                            NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"IUPHAR-DB: the IUPHAR database of G protein-coupled receptors and ion channels","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The druggable genome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The G-protein-coupled receptors in the human genome form five main families.

the IL-1R–associated kinase.\n Tumor necrosis factor receptor–activated factor 6 (TRAF6) and the nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B)–inducing kinase (NIK) are both involved in subsequent steps of NF-?B

development and homeostasis in most higher organisms.\n In order to function, collagens require the specific chaperone HSP47 for proper folding and secretion.\n HSP47 is known to bind to the collagen triple helix, but the exact positions and numbers of binding sites are not clear.\n Here, we employed a collagen II peptide library to characterize high-affinity binding sites for HSP47. We show that many previously predicted binding sites have very low affinities due to the presence of a negatively charged amino acid in the binding motif.\n In contrast, large hydrophobic amino acids such as phenylalanine at certain positions in the collagen sequence increase binding strength.\n For further characterization, we determined two crystal structures of HSP47 bound to peptides containing phenylalanine or leucine.\n These structures deviate significantly from previously published ones in which different collagen sequences were used.\n They reveal local conformational rearrangements of HSP47 at the binding site to accommodate the large hydrophobic side chain from the middle strand of the collagen triple helix and, most surprisingly, possess an altered binding stoichiometry in the form of a 1:1 complex.\n This altered stoichiometry is explained by steric collisions with the second HSP47 molecule present in all structures determined thus far caused by the newly introduced large hydrophobic residue placed on the trailing strand.\n This exemplifies the importance of considering all three sites of homotrimeric collagen as independent interaction surfaces and may provide insight into the formation of higher oligomeric complexes at promiscuous collagen-binding sites.\n","id":"PMC8626583","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Elena

Understanding the mechanism of LncRNAs in RA is therefore critical for the development of new therapy strategies and prevention strategies.\n In this review, we systematically elucidate the biological

Techniques: Tissue-Engineered Cartilage Brings New Hope","abstract":"Hyaline articular cartilage lacks blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves and is characterised by limited self-repair ability following injury.\n Traditional techniques of articular cartilage repair and regeneration all have certain limitations.\n The development of tissue engineering technology has brought hope to the regeneration of articular cartilage.\n The strategies of tissue-engineered articular cartilage can be divided into three types: “cell-scaffold construct,” cell-free, and scaffold-free.\n In “cell-scaffold construct” strategies, seed cells can be autologous chondrocytes or stem.\n Among them, some commercial products with autologous chondrocytes as seed cells, such as BioSeed®-C and CaReS®, have been put on the market and some products are undergoing clinical trials, such as NOVOCART® 3D.\n The stem cells are mainly pluripotent stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells from different sources.\n Cell-free strategies that indirectly utilize the repair and regeneration potential of stem cells have also been used in clinical settings, such as TruFit and MaioRegen.\n Finally, the scaffold-free strategy is also a new development direction, and the short-term repair results of related products, such as NOVOCART® 3D, are encouraging.\n In this paper, the commonly used techniques

Ageing","abstract":"In addition to providing a macromolecular scaffold, the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a critical regulator of cell function by virtue of specific physical, biochemical, and mechanical properties.\n Collagen is the main ECM component and hence plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and progression of chronic lung disease.\n It is well-established that many chronic lung diseases, e.\ng.\n, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) primarily manifest in the elderly, suggesting increased susceptibility of the aged lung or accumulated alterations in lung structure over time that favour disease.\n Here, we review the main steps of collagen biosynthesis, processing, and turnover and summarise what is currently known about alterations upon lung ageing, including changes in collagen composition, modification, and crosslinking.\n Recent proteomic data on mouse lung ageing indicates that, while the ER-resident machinery of collagen biosynthesis, modification and triple helix formation appears largely unchanged, there are specific changes in levels of type IV and type VI as well as the two fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT), namely type XIV and type XVI collagens.\n In addition, levels of the extracellular collagen crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase are decreased, indicating less enzymatically mediated collagen crosslinking upon ageing.\n The latter contrasts with the ageing-associated increase in collagen crosslinking by advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), a result of spontaneous reactions of protein amino groups with reactive carbonyls, e.\ng.\n, from monosaccharides or reactive dicarbonyls like methylglyoxal.\n Given the slow turnover of extracellular collagen such modifications accumulate even more in ageing tissues.\n In summary, the collective evidence points mainly toward age-induced alterations in collagen composition and drastic changes in the molecular nature of collagen crosslinks.\n Future work addressing the consequences of these changes may provide important clues for prevention of lung disease and for lung bioengineering and ultimately pave the way to novel targeted approaches in lung regenerative medicine.\n","id":"PMC8172798","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ceylan","surname":"Onursal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elisabeth","surname":"Dick","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ilias","surname":"Angelidis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Herbert

that facilitate the precise targeting of motor axons to synaptogenic regions of the target muscle.\n Collagenous proteins with transmembrane domains have recently emerged as molecules that play essential roles in multiple aspects of neuromuscular formation.\n Membrane-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (MACITs) are classified as an unconventional subtype of the collagen superfamily and have been implicated in cell adhesion in a variety of tissues, including the neuromuscular system.\n Collagen XXV, the latest member of the MACITs, plays an essential role in motor axon growth within the developing muscle.\n In humans, loss-of-function mutations of collagen XXV result in developmental ocular motor disorders.\n In contrast, collagen XIII contributes to the formation and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), and disruption of its function leads to the congenital myasthenic syndrome.\n Transmembrane collagens are conserved not only in mammals but also in organisms such as C.\n elegans, where a single MACIT, COL-99, has been documented to function in motor innervation.\n Furthermore, in C.\n elegans, a collagen-like transmembrane protein, UNC-122, is implicated in the structural and functional integrity of the NMJ.\n This review article summarizes recent advances in understanding the roles of transmembrane collagens and underlying

process of endochondral ossification in the growth plate but is also an important pathological change in osteoarthritic cartilage.\n Collagen type II (COL2A1) was previously considered to be only a structural component of the cartilage matrix, but recently, it has been revealed to be an extracellular signaling molecule that can significantly suppress chondrocyte hypertrophy.\n However, the mechanisms by which COL2A1 regulates hypertrophic differentiation remain unclear.\n In our study, a Col2a1 p.\nGly1170Ser mutant mouse model was constructed, and Col2a1 loss was demonstrated in homozygotes.\n Loss of Col2a1 was found to accelerate chondrocyte hypertrophy through the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-SMAD1 pathway.\n Upon interacting with COL2A1, integrin ?1 (ITGB1), the major receptor for COL2A1, competed with BMP receptors for binding to SMAD1 and then inhibited SMAD1 activation and nuclear import.\n COL2A1 could also activate ITGB1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and, through ERK1/2-SMAD1 interaction, it further repressed SMAD1 activation, thus inhibiting BMP-SMAD1-mediated chondrocyte hypertrophy.\n Moreover, COL2A1 expression was downregulated, while chondrocyte hypertrophic markers and BMP-SMAD1 signaling activity were upregulated in degenerative human articular cartilage.\n Our study reveals novel mechanisms for the inhibition of chondrocyte hypertrophy by COL2A1 and suggests that the degradation and decrease in COL2A1 might initiate and promote osteoarthritis

(Col V) Mitigate the Progression of Osteoarthritic Rabbit Articular Cartilage","abstract":"Collagen is essential for cartilage adhesion and formation.\n In the present study, histology, immunofluorescence, morphometry, and qRT-PCR suggested that adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) stimulated by type V collagen (Col V) induce a significant increase of type II collagen (Col II) in the degenerative area of surgical-induced osteoarthritic rabbit articular cartilage (OA).\n In vitro, the effects of Col V on the proliferation and differentiation of ADSC were investigated.\n The expression of the cartilage-related genes Col2a1 and Acan was significantly upregulated and Pou5fl was downregulated post-ADSC/Col V treatment.\n Post-ADSC/Col V treatment, in vivo analyses revealed that rabbits showed typical signs of osteoarthritic articular cartilage regeneration by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Safranin O/Fast Green staining.\n Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the volume of Col II fibers and the expression of Col II protein were significantly increased, and apoptosis Fas ligand positive significantly decreased post-ADSC/Col V treatment.\n In conclusion, the expression of Col II was higher in rabbits with surgical-induced osteoarthritic articular cartilage; hence, ADSC/Col V may be a promising therapeutic target for OA treatment.\n","id":"PMC8019831","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Isabele Camargo","surname":"Brindo da

IX collagen deficiency enhances the binding of cartilage-specific antibodies and arthritis severity","abstract":"Joint cartilage is attacked in both autoimmune inflammatory and osteoarthritic processes.\n Type IX collagen (CIX) is a protein of importance for cartilage integrity and stability.\n In this study we have backcrossed a transgenic disruption of the col9a1 gene, which leads to an absence of CIX, into two different inbred mouse strains, DBA/1 and B10.Q.\n None of the CIX-deficient mice developed observable clinical or microscopic osteoarthritis, but DBA/1 male mice had more pronounced enthesopathic arthritis, the so-called stress-induced arthritis.\n Both DBA/1 and B10.Q strains are susceptible to the induction of collagen-induced arthritis, and CIX deficiency in both strains led to the development of a more severe arthritis than in the controls.\n Induction of arthritis with monoclonal antibodies against type II collagen (CII) led to an earlier arthritis in the paws that also involved the knee joints.\n The antibodies used, which were specific for the J1 and the C1I epitopes of CII, initiate their arthritogenic attack by binding to cartilage.\n The C1I-specific antibodies bound to cartilage better in CIX-deficient mice than in wild-type animals, demonstrating that the lack of CIX in cartilage leads to an increased accessibility of structures for antibody binding and thus making the joints more vulnerable to inflammatory attack.\n These findings accentuate the importance of cartilage stability; cartilage disrupted as a result of genetic disorders could be more accessible and vulnerable to an autoimmune attack by pathogenic antibodies.\n","id":"PMC1779414","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Carlsen","email":"stefan.carlsen@med.lu.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kutty

cartilage, and mutations in the genes encoding type XI collagen are associated with severe skeletal dysplasias (fibrochondrogenesis and Stickler syndrome) and early-onset osteoarthritis (OA).\n The impact of the lack of type XI collagen on cell behaviour and mechanical performance during skeleton development is unknown.\n We studied a zebrafish mutant for col11a2 and evaluated cartilage, bone development and mechanical properties to address this.\n We show that in col11a2 mutants, type II collagen is made but is prematurely degraded in maturing cartilage and ectopically expressed in the joint.\n These changes are correlated with increased stiffness of both bone and cartilage; quantified using atomic force microscopy.\n In the mutants, the skeletal rudiment terminal region in the jaw joint is broader and the interzone smaller.\n These differences in shape and material properties impact on joint function and mechanical performance, which we modelled using finite element analyses.\n Finally, we show that col11a2 heterozygous carriers reach adulthood but show signs of severe early-onset OA.\n Taken together, our data demonstrate a key role for type XI collagen in maintaining the

caused by the wearing and tearing of articular cartilage, but it is now more commonly referred to as a chronic whole-joint disorder that is initiated with biochemical and cellular alterations in the synovial joint tissues, which leads to the histological and structural changes of the joint and ends up with the whole tissue dysfunction.\n Currently, there is no cure for OA, partly due to a lack of comprehensive understanding of the pathological mechanism of the initiation and progression of the disease.\n Therefore, a better understanding of pathological signaling pathways and key molecules involved in OA pathogenesis is crucial for therapeutic target design and drug development.\n In this review, we first summarize the epidemiology of OA, including its prevalence, incidence and burdens, and OA risk factors.\n We then focus on the roles and regulation of the pathological signaling pathways, such as Wnt/?-catenin, NF-?B, focal adhesion, HIFs, TGF?/??P and FGF signaling pathways, and key regulators AMPK, mTOR, and RUNX2 in the onset and development of OA.\n In addition, the roles of factors associated with OA, including MMPs, ADAMTS/ADAMs, and PRG4, are discussed in detail.\n Finally, we provide updates on the current clinical therapies and clinical trials of biological treatments and drugs for OA.\n Research advances in basic knowledge of articular cartilage biology and

adiponectin on the OA cartilage homeostasis.\n\n\nMethods\nImmunohistochemical analysis was performed to evaluate differential expression of adiponectin receptors (AdipoRs) in nonlesional and lesional areas of OA cartilage.\n\n Cartilage and chondrocytes from the knee joints of primary OA patients were cultured in the presence of adiponectin (0~30 ?g/ml).\n\n The levels of total nitric oxide (NO), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -3, and -13, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 were measured in the conditioned media.\n\n The levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and MMPs were determined with the quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.\n\n The concentrations of collagenase-cleaved type II collagen neoepitope (C1-2C) were determined in the supernatant of adiponectin-stimulated OA cartilage explants.\n\n The effects of kinase and NOS inhibitors were evaluated in the adiponectin-stimulated chondrocytes.\n\n\nResults\nThe expression levels of both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 were significantly higher in lesional than in nonlesional areas of OA cartilage.\n\n The increased rate of AdipoR1-positive chondrocytes was twice that of AdipoR2-positive chondrocytes when compared between nonlesional and lesional areas.\n\n Adiponectin-stimulated OA chondrocytes showed increased total NO and MMP-1, -3, and -13 levels compared with nonstimulated

component of the extracellular matrix that supports tissue formation and maintenance.\n Although collagen remodeling is an integral part of normal tissue renewal, excessive amount of remodeling activity is involved in tumors, arthritis, and many other pathological conditions.\n During collagen remodeling, the triple helical structure of collagen molecules is disrupted by proteases in the extracellular environment.\n In addition, collagens present in many histological tissue samples are partially denatured by the fixation and preservation processes.\n Therefore, these denatured collagen strands can serve as effective targets for biological imaging.\n We previously developed a caged collagen mimetic peptide (CMP) that can be photo-triggered to hybridize with denatured collagen strands by forming triple helical structure, which is unique to collagens.\n The overall goals of this procedure are i) to image denatured collagen strands resulting from normal remodeling activities in vivo, and ii) to visualize collagens in ex vivo tissue sections using the photo-triggered caged CMPs.\n To achieve effective hybridization and successful in vivo and ex vivo imaging, fluorescently labeled caged CMPs are either photo-activated immediately before intravenous injection, or are directly activated on tissue sections.\n Normal skeletal collagen remolding in nude mice and collagens in prefixed mouse cornea tissue sections are imaged in this procedure.\n The imaging method based on the CMP-collagen hybridization technology presented here could lead to deeper

variants termed as type IIA and type IIB collagen NH2-propeptide (PIIANP, PIIBNP).\n PIIANP has been widely recognized as a cartilage formation biomarker.\n However, the utility of PIIBNP as a marker in preclinical and clinical settings has not been fully investigated yet.\n In this study, we aimed to characterize an antibody targeting human PIIBNP and to develop an immunoassay assessing type II collagen synthesis in human blood samples.\n A high sensitivity electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, hsPRO-C2, was developed using a well-characterized antibody against human PIIBNP.\n Human cartilage explants from replaced osteoarthritis knees were cultured for ten weeks in the presence of growth factors, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) or recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 18 (rhFGF-18).\n The culture medium was changed every seven days, and levels of PIIBNP, PIIANP, and matrix metalloproteinase 9-mediated degradation of type II collagen (C2M) were analyzed herein.\n Serum samples from a cross-sectional knee osteoarthritis cohort, as well as pediatric and rheumatoid arthritis samples, were assayed for PIIBNP and PIIANP.\n Western blot showed that the antibody recognized PIIBNP either as a free fragment or attached to the main molecule.\n Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that PIIBNP was predominately located in the extracellular matrix of the superficial and deep zones and chondrocytes in both normal and osteoarthritic articular cartilage.\n In addition, the hsPRO-C2 immunoassay exhibits acceptable technical performances.\n In the human cartilage explants model, levels of PIIBNP, but not PIIANP and C2M, were increased (2 to 7-fold) time-dependently in response to IGF-1. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between PIIBNP and PIIANP levels when measured in knee osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and pediatric serum samples.\n Serum PIIBNP was significantly higher in controls (KL0/1) compared to OA groups (KL2/3/4, p = 0.012).\n The hsPRO-C2 assay shows completely different biological and clinical patterns than PIIANP ELISA, suggesting that it may be a promising biomarker of cartilage formation.\n","id":"PMC6275061","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yunyun","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ditte","surname":"Reker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Natasja

matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) mediated degradation of type IV collagen, a main component of the basement membrane, will release peptide fragments (neo-epitopes) into the circulation.\n\n Here we present the development of two competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for assessing the levels of specific fragments of type IV collagen ?1 (C4M12a1) and ?3 (C4M12a3) chains in serum as indicators of fibrosis.\n\n\nMethods\nFragments of type IV collagen cleaved in\nvitro by MMP-12 were identified by mass spectrometry, and two were chosen for ELISA development due to their unique sequences.\n\n The assays were evaluated using samples from a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) rat model of liver fibrosis and from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n\nResults\nTwo technically robust ELISAs were produced using neo-epitope specific monoclonal antibodies.\n\n Mean serum C4M12a1 levels were significantly elevated in CCl4-treated rats compared with controls in weeks 12, 16, and 20, with a maximum increase of 102% at week 16 (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Further, C4M12a1 levels correlated with the total collagen content of

C4M12a1 was elevated in a pre-clinical model of liver fibrosis, and C4M12a3 was elevated in IPF and COPD patients.\n\n This suggests the use of these assays to investigate pathological remodeling of

eventually leading to irreversible lesions involving major complications or surgery.\n In the early stages, conservative treatment plays a key role in the prophylaxis of complications and in slowing down the degenerative process.\n The association between an appropriate drug therapy (DT) and a rehabilitation treatment (RT)—including individualized physical therapy (PT) and adapted occupational therapy (OT)—provides good results.\n Our objective was to highlight the benefits of associating RT with DT in patients with hip OA.\n Materials and Methods: An observational follow-up study was conducted between 2018–2021, which included 100 patients with hip OA divided into two groups: the study group—group A (50 subjects who complied with RT) and the control group—group B (who did not comply with RT).\n To evaluate them, the evolution of the Lequesne hip index (LHI), Tinetti test (TT) and the hip joint mobility: flexion (FH) and abduction (AH) were monitored before the beginning of the study (T0) and after one-year (T1) for each patient.\n The mean values of the parameters, the standard deviations, the frequency intervals, as well as the tests of statistical significance were

Potential Supplements to Support Joint Health in Osteoarthritis?","abstract":"Purpose of Review\nid='Par1'>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common forms of arthritis in the general population, accounting for more pain and functional disability than any other musculoskeletal disease.\n\n There are currently no approved disease modifying drugs for OA.\n\n In the absence of effective pharmacotherapy, many patients with OA turn to nutritional supplements and nutraceuticals, including collagen derivatives.\n\n Collagen hydrolyzates and ultrahydrolyzates are terms used to describe collagens that have been broken down into small peptides and amino acids in the presence of collagenases and high pressure.\n\n\nRecent Findings\nid='Par2'>This article reviews the relevant literature and serves as a White Paper on collagen hydrolyzates and ultrahydrolyzates as emerging supplements often advertised to support joint health in OA.\n\n Collagen hydrolyzates have demonstrated some evidence of efficacy in a handful of small scale clinical trials, but their ability to treat and reverse advanced joint disease remains highly speculative, as is the case for other nutritional supplements.\n\n\nSummary\nid='Par3'>The aim of this White Paper is to stimulate research and development of collagen-based supplements for patients with OA and other musculoskeletal diseases at academic and industrial levels.\n\n This White Paper does not make any treatment recommendations for OA patients in the clinical context, but simply aims to highlight opportunities for scientific innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration, which are crucial for the development of novel products and nutritional interventions based on the best available and published evidence.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8556166","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ali","surname":"Mobasheri","email":"ali.mobasheri@oulu.fi","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Armaghan","surname":"Mahmoudian","email":"armaghan.mahmoudian@gmail.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Armaghan","surname":"Mahmoudian","email":"armaghan.mahmoudian@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ursule","surname":"Kalvaityte","email":"ursule.kalvaityte@imcentras.lt","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ursule","surname":"Kalvaityte","email":"ursule.kalvaityte@imcentras.lt","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ilona","surname":"Uzieliene","email":"ilona.uzieliene@imcentras.lt","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ilona","surname":"Uzieliene","email":"ilona.uzieliene@imcentras.lt","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christina

A Systematic Scoping Review With Evidence Mapping","abstract":"Introduction\nid='Par1'>There is currently no disease-modifying drug for osteoarthritis (OA), and some safety concerns have been identified about the leading traditional drugs.\n\n Therefore, research efforts have focused on alternatives such as supplementation with collagen derivatives.\n\n The objective of this scoping review is to examine the extent, range, and nature of research, and to summarize and disseminate research findings on the effects of collagen derivatives in OA and cartilage repair.\n\n The purpose is to identify gaps in the current body of evidence in order to further help progress research in this setting.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>The databases Medline, Scopus, CENTRAL, TOXLINE, and CDSR were comprehensively searched from inception to search date.\n\n After studies selection against eligibility criteria, following recommended methods, data were charted from the retrieved articles and these were subsequently synthesized.\n\n Numerical and graphical descriptive statistical methods were used to show trends in publications and geographical distribution of studies.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The systematic literature search identified a total of 10,834 records.\n\n Forty-one published studies were ultimately included in the review, 16 of which were preclinical studies and 25 were clinical studies (including four systematic reviews/meta-analyses).\n\n Collagen hydrolysate (CH) and undenatured collagen (UC) were the two types of collagen derivatives studied, with a total of 28 individual studies on CH and nine on UC.\n\n More than a third of studies originated from Asia, and most of them have been published after 2008. Oral forms of collagen derivatives were mainly studied; three in vivo preclinical studies and three clinical trials investigated intra-articularly injected CH.\n\n In most of the clinical trials, treatment durations varied between 3 and 6 months, with the shortest being 1.4 months and the longest 11 months.\n\n All in vivo preclinical studies and clinical trials, regardless of their quality, concluded on beneficial effects of collagen derivatives in OA and cartilage repair, whether used as nutritional supplement or delivered intra-articularly, and whatever the manufacturers of the products, the doses and the outcomes considered in each study.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Although current evidence shows some potential for the use of CH and UC as an option for management of patients with OA, there is still room for progress in terms of laboratory and clinical research before any definitive conclusion can be made.\n\n Harmonization of outcomes in preclinical studies and

nanoplatform with NIR laser response for osteoarthritis therapy","abstract":"Cartilage-targeting delivery of therapeutic agents is still an effective strategy for osteoarthritis (OA) therapy.\n Recently, scavenging for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activating autophagy have been increasingly reported to treat OA effectively.\n In this study, we designed, for the first time, a dual-drug delivery system based on metal organic framework (MOF)-decorated mesoporous polydopamine (MPDA) which composed of rapamycin (Rap) loaded into the mesopores and bilirubin (Br) loaded onto the shell of MOF.\n The collagen II-targeting peptide (WYRGRL) was then conjugated on the surface of above nanocarrier to develop a cartilage-targeting dual-drug delivery nanoplatform (RB@MPMW).\n Our results indicated the sequential release of two agents from RB@MPMW could be achieved via near-infrared (NIR) laser irritation.\n Briefly, the rapid release of Br from the MOF shell exhibited excellent ROS scavenging ability and anti-apoptosis effects, however responsively reduced autophagy activity, to a certain extent.\n Meanwhile, following the NIR irradiation, Rap was rapidly released from MPDA core and further enhanced autophagy activation and chondrocyte protection.\n RB@MPMW continuously phosphorylated AMPK and further rescued mitochondrial energy metabolism of chondrocytes following IL-1? stimulation via activating SIRT1-PGC-1? signaling pathway.\n Additionally, the cartilage-targeting property of peptide-modified nanocarrier could be monitored via Magnetic Resonance (MR) and IVIS imaging.\n More significantly, RB@MPMW effectively delayed cartilage degeneration in ACLT rat model.\n Overall, our findings indicated that the as-prepared dual-drug delivery nanoplatform exerted potent anti-inflammation and anti-apoptotic effects, rescued energy metabolism of chondrocytes in vitro and prevented cartilage degeneration in vivo, which thereby showed positive performance for OA therapy.\n","id":"PMC7844135","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Song","surname":"Xue","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaojun","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weilin","surname":"Sang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haiming","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yiming","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yiming","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Libo","surname":"Zhu","email":"zhulibo@medmail.com.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chuanglong","surname":"He","email":"hcl@dhu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jinzhong","surname":"Ma","email":"majinzhong1963@sina.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.actbio.2014.01.002","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Mesenchymal

for the durable repair of cartilage, with long-term follow-up studies indicating improved structural and functional outcomes.\n However, disadvantages of this technique include the need for additional surgery, availability of sufficient chondrocytes for implantation, and maintenance of their phenotype during culture-expansion.\n Mesenchymal stem cells offer an attractive alternative cell-source for cartilage repair, due to their ease of isolation and amenability to ex vivo expansion while retaining stem cell properties.\n Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of mesenchymal stem cells to promote articular cartilage repair, but have also highlighted several key challenges.\n Most notably, the quality and durability of the repair tissue, its resistance to endochondral ossification, and its effective integration with the surrounding host tissue.\n In addition, challenges exist related to the heterogeneity of mesenchymal stem cell preparations and their quality-control, as well as optimising the delivery method.\n Finally, as our knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying articular cartilage repair increases, promising studies are

large\nnumber of biomedical resources by unifying the vocabularies that are used to access\nthose resources.\n The UMLS currently interrelates some 60 controlled vocabularies in\nthe biomedical domain.\n The UMLS coverage is quite extensive, including not only\nmany concepts in clinical medicine, but also a large number of concepts applicable to\nthe broad domain of the life sciences.\n In order to provide an overarching conceptual\nframework for all UMLS concepts, we developed an upper-level ontology, called the\nUMLS semantic network.\n The semantic network, through its 134 semantic types,\nprovides a consistent categorization of all concepts represented in the UMLS.\n The 54\nlinks between the semantic types provide the structure for the network and represent\nimportant relationships in the biomedical domain.\n Because of the growing number of\ninformation resources that contain genetic information, the UMLS coverage in this\narea is being expanded.\n We recently integrated the taxonomy of organisms developed\nby the NLM's National Center for Biotechnology Information, and we are currently\nworking together with the developers of the Gene Ontology to integrate this resource,\nas well.\n As additional, standard, ontologies become publicly available, we expect to\nintegrate these into the UMLS construct.\n","id":"PMC2447396","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexa

cell is crucial to understanding tissue homeostasis and its aberrations upon disease.\n Here we present a computational method for the derivation of a lineage tree from single-cell transcriptome data.\n By exploiting the tree topology and the transcriptome composition, we establish StemID, an algorithm for identifying stem cells among all detectable cell types within a population.\n We demonstrate that StemID recovers two known adult stem cell populations, Lgr5+ cells in the small intestine and hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.\n We apply StemID to predict candidate multipotent cell populations in the human pancreas, a tissue with largely uncharacterized turnover dynamics.\n We hope that StemID will accelerate the search for novel stem cells by providing concrete

ontology interoperability","abstract":"Background\nThe Cell Ontology (CL) is an OBO Foundry candidate ontology covering the domain of canonical, natural biological cell types.\n\n Since its inception in 2005, the CL has undergone multiple rounds of revision and expansion, most notably in its representation of hematopoietic cells.\n\n For in vivo cells, the CL focuses on vertebrates but provides general classes that can be used for other metazoans, which can be subtyped in species-specific ontologies.\n\n\nConstruction and content\nRecent work on the CL has focused on extending the representation of various cell types, and developing new modules in the CL itself, and in related ontologies in coordination with the CL.\n\n For example, the Kidney and Urinary Pathway Ontology was used as a template to populate the CL with additional cell types.\n\n In addition, subtypes of the class ‘cell in vitro’ have received improved definitions and labels to provide for modularity with the representation of cells in the Cell Line Ontology and Reagent Ontology.\n\n Recent changes in the ontology development methodology for CL include a switch from OBO to OWL for the primary encoding of the ontology, and an increasing reliance on logical definitions for improved reasoning.\n\n\nUtility and discussion\nThe CL is now mandated as a metadata standard for large functional genomics and transcriptomics projects, and is used extensively for annotation, querying, and analyses of cell type specific data in sequencing consortia such as FANTOM5 and ENCODE, as well as for the NIAID ImmPort database and the Cell Image Library.\n\n The CL is also a vital component used in the modular construction of other biomedical ontologies—for example, the Gene Ontology and the cross-species anatomy ontology, Uberon, use CL to support the consistent representation of cell types across different levels of anatomical granularity, such as tissues and organs.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe ongoing improvements to the CL make it a valuable resource to both the OBO Foundry community and the wider scientific community, and we continue to experience increased interest in the CL both among developers and within the user community.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4932724","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander

complete the 150-year-old effort to identify all cell types in the human body.\n The Human Cell Atlas Project is an international collaborative effort that aims to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles (such as gene expression profiles) and to connect this information with classical cellular descriptions (such as location and morphology).\n An open comprehensive reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues would propel the systematic study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory circuitry and interactions of

limited alignment between taxonomies.\n To facilitate cross-dataset comparison, the Allen Institute created the common cell type nomenclature (CCN) for matching and tracking cell types across studies that is qualitatively similar to gene transcript management across different genome builds.\n The CCN can be readily applied to new or established taxonomies and was applied herein to diverse cell type datasets derived from multiple quantifiable modalities.\n The CCN facilitates assigning accurate yet flexible cell type names in the mammalian cortex as a step toward community-wide efforts to

initiatives to help address this problem.\n We posit that a contributor is simply a lack of specificity that is required to enable adequate research reproducibility.\n In particular, the inability to uniquely identify research resources, such as antibodies and model organisms, makes it difficult or impossible to reproduce experiments even where the science is otherwise sound.\n In order to better understand the magnitude of this problem, we designed an experiment to ascertain the “identifiability” of research resources in the biomedical literature.\n We evaluated recent journal articles in the fields of Neuroscience, Developmental Biology, Immunology, Cell and Molecular Biology and General Biology, selected randomly based on a diversity of impact factors for the journals, publishers, and experimental method reporting guidelines.\n We attempted to uniquely identify model organisms (mouse, rat, zebrafish, worm, fly and yeast), antibodies, knockdown reagents (morpholinos or RNAi), constructs, and cell lines.\n Specific criteria were developed to determine if a resource was uniquely identifiable, and included examining relevant repositories (such as model organism databases, and the Antibody Registry), as well as vendor sites.\n The results of this experiment show that 54% of resources are not uniquely identifiable in publications, regardless of domain, journal impact factor, or reporting requirements.\n For example, in many cases the organism strain in which the experiment was performed or antibody that was used could not be identified.\n Our results show that identifiability is a serious problem for reproducibility.\n Based on these results, we provide recommendations to authors, reviewers, journal editors, vendors, and publishers.\n Scientific efficiency and reproducibility depend upon a research-wide improvement of this substantial problem in science today.\n","id":"PMC3771067","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicole

compound identifier mapping service on the internet, designed to optimize the efficiency with which structure-based hyperlinks may be built and maintained between chemistry-based resources.\n In the past, the creation and maintenance of such links at EMBL-EBI, where several chemistry-based resources exist, has required independent efforts by each of the separate teams.\n These efforts were complicated by the different data models, release schedules, and differing business rules for compound normalization and identifier nomenclature that exist across the organization.\n UniChem, a large-scale, non-redundant database of Standard InChIs with pointers between these structures and chemical identifiers from all the separate chemistry resources, was developed as a means of efficiently sharing the maintenance overhead of creating these links.\n Thus, for each source represented in UniChem, all links to and from all other sources are automatically calculated and immediately available for all to use.\n Updated mappings are immediately available upon loading of new data releases from the sources.\n Web services in UniChem provide users with a single simple automatable mechanism for maintaining all links from their resource to all other sources represented in UniChem.\n In addition, functionality to track changes in identifier usage allows users to monitor which identifiers are current, and which are obsolete.\n Lastly, UniChem has been deliberately designed to allow additional resources to be included with minimal effort.\n Indeed, the recent inclusion of data sources external to EMBL-EBI has provided a simple means of providing users with an even wider selection of resources with which to link to, all at no extra cost, while at the same time providing a simple mechanism for external resources to link to all EMBL-EBI chemistry resources.\n","id":"PMC3616875","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jon","surname":"Chambers","email":"chambers@ebi.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Davies","email":"mdavies@ebi.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Gaulton","email":"agaulton@ebi.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anne","surname":"Hersey","email":"ahersey@ebi.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sameer","surname":"Velankar","email":"sameer@ebi.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Petryszak","email":"rpetry@ebi.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Janna","surname":"Hastings","email":"hastings@ebi.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Louisa","surname":"Bellis","email":"ljbellis@ebi.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shaun","surname":"McGlinchey","email":"shaun@ebi.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John

a web-based Chemical Translation Service that performs batch conversions of the most common compound identifiers, including CAS, CHEBI, compound formulas, Human Metabolome Database HMDB, InChI, InChIKey, IUPAC name, KEGG, LipidMaps, PubChem CID+SID, SMILES and chemical synonym names.\n Batch conversion downloads of 1410 CIDs are performed in 2.5 min.\n Structures are automatically

largest currently existing sets of real (i.\ne.\n not computer-generated) compounds.\n This analysis was carried out using calculable chemical structure identifiers developed by the NCI CADD Group, based on hash codes available in the chemoinformatics toolkit CACTVS and a newly developed scoring scheme to define a canonical tautomer for any encountered structure.\n CACTVS’s tautomerism definition, a set of 21 transform rules expressed in SMIRKS line notation, was used, which takes a comprehensive stance as to the possible types of tautomeric interconversion included.\n Tautomerism was found to be possible for more than 2/3 of the unique structures in the CSDB.\n A total of 680 million tautomers were calculated from, and including, the original structure records.\n Tautomerism overlap within the same individual database (i.\ne.\n at least one other entry was present that was really only a different tautomeric representation of the same compound) was found at an average rate of 0.3% of the original structure records, with values as high as nearly 2% for some of the databases in CSDB.\n Projected onto the set of unique structures (by FICuS identifier), this still occurred in about 1.5% of the cases.\n Tautomeric overlap across all constituent databases in CSDB was found for nearly 10% of the records in the collection.\n","id":"PMC2886898","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Markus","surname":"Sitzmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wolf-Dietrich","surname":"Ihlenfeldt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc

bronchitis with purulent sputum. The BAAP Study protocol","abstract":"Background\nAcute bronchitis is one of the most prevalent respiratory infections in primary care, and in more than 90% of the cases antibiotics are prescribed, mainly when purulent expectoration is present.\n\n However, this process is usually viral in origin and the benefits of antibiotic treatment are marginal.\n\n On the other hand, in recent years bronchitis has been considered more as an inflammatory than an infectious process.\n\n Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a schedule of an oral anti-inflammatory compared with an antibiotic regimen and another group assigned to receive a placebo.\n\n\nMethods and design\nA total of 420 patients from 15 to 70 years of age with no associated comorbidity, presenting respiratory tract infection of at least one week of evolution, with cough as the predominant symptom, the presence of purulent expectoration and at least one other symptom of the respiratory tract (dyspnoea, wheezing, chest discomfort or pain), with no alternative explanation such as pneumonia, will be included in a prospective, randomised and controlled, clinical trial with placebo.\n\n The patients will be randomised to receive one of three treatments: ibuprofen, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid or placebo for 10 days.\n\n The main outcome measure is the number of days with frequent cough defined by the symptom diary with a score of 1 or more.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis trial is designed to evaluate the number of days with frequent cough with anti-inflammatory treatment compared with antimicrobial treatment and placebo in previously healthy patients with a clinical picture of acute bronchitis and purulent expectoration.\n\n It is hypothesized that anti-inflammatory treatment is more effective than antibiotic treatment to reduce cough, which is the most disturbing symptom for patients with this infection.\n\n\nTrial

acute respiratory infections in trials in general practice, but the uptake in clinical practice is low.\n\n The aim of the study was to identify facilitators and barriers to general practitioners’ (GPs’) use of delayed prescribing and to gain pharmacists’ and the public’s views about delayed prescribing in Australia.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study used the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Behaviour Change Wheel to explore facilitators and barriers to delayed prescribing in Australia.\n\n Forty-three semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with general practitioners, pharmacists and patients were conducted.\n\n Responses were coded into domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework, and specific criteria from the Behaviour Change Wheel were used to identify which domains were relevant to increasing the use of delayed prescribing by GPs.\n\n\nResults\nThe interviews revealed nine key domains that influence GPs’ use of delayed prescribing: knowledge; cognitive and interpersonal skills; memory, attention and decision-making processes; optimism; beliefs about consequences; intentions; goals; emotion; and social influences: GPs knew about delayed prescribing; however, they did not use it consistently, preferring to bring patients back for review and only using it with patients in a highly selective way.\n\n Pharmacists would support GPs and the public in delayed prescribing but would fill the prescription if people insisted.\n\n The public said they would delay taking their antibiotics if asked by their GP and given the right information on managing symptoms and when to take antibiotics.\n\n\nConclusions\nUsing a theory-driven approach, we identified nine key domains that influence GPs’ willingness to provide a delayed prescription to patients with an acute respiratory infection presenting to general practice.\n\n These data can be used to develop a structured intervention to change this behaviour and thus reduce antibiotic use for acute

by concerns about antibiotic over-prescription.\n Children's views were not reported.\n Clinicians prescribed antibiotics when they felt pressured by parents or others (e.\ng.\n employers) to do so, when they believed there was a clear clinical indication, but also when they felt uncertain of clinical or social outcomes they prescribed “just in case”.\n Parents wanted antibiotics when they felt they would improve the current illness, and when they felt pressure from daycare providers or employers.\n Clinicians avoided antibiotics when they were concerned about adverse reactions or drug resistance, when certain they were not indicated, and when there was no perceived pressure from parents.\n Parents also wished to avoid adverse effects of antibiotics, and did not want antibiotics when they would not relieve current symptoms.\n Some parents preferred to avoid medication altogether.\n Within paediatric consultations, parents sought a medical evaluation and decision.\n Primary care clinicians want satisfied parents and short consultations.\n Conclusions.\n Antibiotic prescriptions for childhood infections in primary care often result from “just in case” prescribing.\n These

used to identify GP practices whose prescribing rate for antibiotics was in the top 20% for their National Health Service (NHS) Local Area Team.\n\n Eligible practices were randomly assigned (1:1) into two groups by computer-generated allocation sequence, stratified by NHS Local Area Team.\n\n Participants, but not investigators, were blinded to group assignment.\n\n On Sept 29, 2014, every GP in the feedback intervention group was sent a letter from England's Chief Medical Officer and a leaflet on antibiotics for use with patients.\n\n The letter stated that the practice was prescribing antibiotics at a higher rate than 80% of practices in its NHS Local Area Team.\n\n GPs in the control group received no communication.\n\n The sample was re-randomised into two groups, and in December, 2014, GP practices were either sent patient-focused information that promoted reduced use of antibiotics or received no communication.\n\n The primary outcome measure was the rate of antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 weighted population, controlling for past prescribing.\n\n Analysis was by intention to treat.\n\n This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN32349954, and has been completed.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Sept 8 and Sept 26, 2014, we recruited and assigned 1581 GP practices to feedback intervention (n=791) or control (n=790) groups.\n\n Letters were sent to 3227 GPs in the intervention group.\n\n Between October, 2014, and March, 2015, the rate of antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 population was 126·98 (95% CI 125·68–128·27) in the feedback intervention group and 131·25 (130·33–132·16) in the control group, a difference of 4·27 (3·3%; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·967 [95% CI 0·957–0·977]; p&lt;0·0001), representing an estimated 73?406 fewer antibiotic items dispensed.\n\n In December, 2014, GP practices were re-assigned to patient-focused intervention (n=777) or control (n=804) groups.\n\n The patient-focused intervention did not significantly affect the primary outcome measure between December, 2014, and March, 2015 (antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 population: 135·00 [95% CI 133·77–136·22] in the patient-focused intervention group and 133·98 [133·06–134·90] in the control group; IRR for difference between groups 1·01, 95% CI 1·00–1·02; p=0·105).\n\n\nInterpretation\nSocial norm feedback from a high-profile messenger can substantially reduce antibiotic prescribing at low cost and at national scale; this outcome makes it a worthwhile addition to antimicrobial stewardship programmes.\n\n\nFunding\nPublic Health England.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4842844","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Hallsworth","email":"michael.hallsworth@behaviouralinsights.co.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tim","surname":"Chadborn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Sallis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Sanders","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Berry","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Felix","surname":"Greaves","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lara","surname":"Clements","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sally
