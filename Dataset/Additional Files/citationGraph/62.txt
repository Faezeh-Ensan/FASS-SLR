in its own right, has become a major part of many different medical fields.\n However, its relationship to orthopedics and trauma surgery has unfortunately, and perhaps unjustly, been developing rather slowly.\n Discoveries in recent years have emphasized the immense breadth of communication and connection between both systems and, importantly, the highly promising therapeutic opportunities.\n Recent discoveries of factors originally assigned to the immune system have now also been shown to have a significant impact on bone health and disease, which has greatly changed how we approach treatment of bone pathologies.\n In case of bone fracture, immune cells, especially macrophages, are present throughout the whole healing process, assure defense against pathogens and discharge a complex variety of effectors to regulate bone modeling.\n In rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis, the immune system contributes to the formation of the pathological and chronic conditions.\n Fascinatingly, prosthesis failure is not at all solely a mechanical problem of improper strain but works in conjunction with an active contribution of the immune system as a reaction to irritant debris from material wear.\n Unraveling conjoined mechanisms of the immune and osseous systems heralds therapeutic possibilities for ailments of both.\n Contemplation of the bone as merely an unchanging support pillar is outdated and obsolete.\n Instead it is mandatory that this highly diverse network be incorporated in our understanding of the immune system and

constructs typically consist of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) forming a cartilage template in vitro, which can be implanted to stimulate bone formation in vivo.\n The use of MSCs of allogeneic origin could potentially improve the clinical utility of the tissue engineered cartilage constructs in three ways.\n First, ready-to-use construct availability can speed up the treatment process.\n Second, MSCs derived and expanded from a single donor could be applied to treat several patients and thus the costs of the medical interventions would decrease.\n Finally, it would allow more control over the quality of the MSC chondrogenic differentiation.\n However, even though the envisaged clinical use of allogeneic cell sources for bone regeneration is advantageous, their immunogenicity poses a significant obstacle to their clinical application.\n The aim of this review is to increase the awareness of the role played by immune cells during endochondral ossification, and in particular during regenerative strategies when the immune response is altered by the presence of implanted biomaterials and/or cells.\n More specifically, we focus on how this balance between

CEP, along with the immunosuppressive molecular factors are defined as the blood-NP barrier (BNB), which establishes a strong barrier to isolate the NP from the host immune system.\n When the BNB is damaged, the auto-immune response of the NP occurs with various downstream cascade reactions.\n This effect plays an important role in the whole process of IVD degeneration and related complications, such as herniation, sciatica and spontaneous herniated NP regression.\n Taken together, an enhanced understanding of the immune privilege of the IVD could provide new targets for the treatment of symptomatic IVD disease.\n However, the underlying mechanism above is still not fully clarified.\n Accordingly, the current study will extensively review and discuss studies regarding the immune privilege of the IVD.\n","id":"PMC7085207","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhen","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bing","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhuo-Jing","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/nri.2016.150","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Regulation

369 diseases and injuries in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019","abstract":"Background\nIn an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential.\n\n The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries.\n\n\nMethods\nGBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories.\n\n Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources.\n\n Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression.\n\n Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates.\n\n Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs.\n\n A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes.\n\n Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs.\n\n We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years.\n\n Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution.\n\n\nFindings\nGlobal health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates.\n\n After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable.\n\n Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990–2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0–9-year age group.\n\n Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth).\n\n In adolescents aged 10–24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth).\n\n Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10–24 years were also in the top ten in the 25–49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth).\n\n In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50–74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups.\n\n Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries.\n\n In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden.\n\n Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAs disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies.\n\n With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes.\n\n The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates

countries and territories: a secondary analysis of the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study","abstract":"Objective\nTo evaluate the global burden of musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders, as well as the five common conditions, and their relevant risk factors from 1990 to 2019.\nDesign\nData from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 were used in this study.\n\n\nSetting and participants\nIndividuals of all ages and genders from 204 countries and territories in 21 regions.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nThe outcomes were the numbers and age-standardised rates (ASRs) of incident cases, deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of MSK disorders.\n\n The average annual percent changes (AAPCs) in the ASRs were calculated using joinpoint regression analysis to estimate the trends.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 322.75 million incident cases, 117.54 thousand deaths and 150.08 million DALYs of MSK disorders in 2019. The age-standardised incidence rate and age-standardised DALY rate in 2019 (incidence: AAPC=?0.32, 95% CI ?0.34 to ?0.31; DALYs: AAPC=?0.05, 95% CI ?0.06 to ?0.04) were lower than those in 1990. However, the age-standardised death rate showed a stable trend (AAPC 0.05, 95% CI ?0.05 to 0.15) from 1990 to 2019. The peak age of onset and DALYs of MSK disorders was 50–54 years in 2019. The burden of MSK disorders in females was much higher than that in males (1.29 times more incident cases, 2.24 times more deaths and 1.45 times more DALYs in females than in males).\n\n A significant negative correlation was observed between the AAPCs in the ASRs and the Sociodemographic Index (SDI) score.\n\n Occupational risk exhibited the highest contribution to MSK disorders, and tobacco use and high body mass index were also major risk factors.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates that the burden of MSK disorders tends to be lower in high-SDI regions than in lower-SDI regions.\n\n Strengthening the effectiveness of preventive measures against occupational risks may reduce the burden of MSK disorders.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9244680","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shiwen","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Binyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuzhen","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yaxuan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuxuan","surname":"Zhan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ding","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/annrheumdis-2019-215142","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The

pathologies involving cartilage, subchondral bone and (increasingly recognized) inflammation of the synovium.\n The synovium may show significant changes, even before visible cartilage degeneration has occurred, with infiltration of mononuclear cells, thickening of the synovial lining layer and production of inflammatory cytokines.\n The combination of sensitive imaging modalities and tissue examination has confirmed a high prevalence of synovial inflammation in all stages of OA, with a number of studies demonstrating that synovitis is related to pain, poor function and may even be an independent driver of radiographic OA onset and structural progression.\n Treating key aspects of synovial inflammation therefore holds great promise for analgesia and also for structure modification.\n This article will review current knowledge on the prevalence of synovitis in OA and its role in symptoms and structural progression, and explore lessons learnt from targeting synovitis

(2) Why are the epidemics so explosive? (3) Why do they end so abruptly? (4) What explains the frequent coincidental timing of epidemics in countries of similar latitude? (5) Why is the serial interval obscure? (6) Why is the secondary attack rate so low? (7) Why did epidemics in previous ages spread so rapidly, despite the lack of modern transport? (8) Why does experimental inoculation of seronegative humans fail to cause illness in all the volunteers? (9) Why has influenza mortality of the aged not declined as their vaccination rates increased? We review recent discoveries about vitamin D's effects on innate immunity, human studies attempting sick-to-well transmission, naturalistic reports of human transmission, studies of serial interval, secondary attack rates, and relevant animal studies.\n We hypothesize that two factors explain the nine conundrums: vitamin D's seasonal and population effects on innate immunity, and the presence of a subpopulation of 'good infectors.\n' If true, our revision of Edgar Hope-Simpson's theory has profound implications for the prevention of influenza.\n","id":"PMC2279112","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"John J","surname":"Cannell","email":"jcannell@ash.dmh.ca.gov","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Zasloff","email":"maz5@georgetown.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cedric F","surname":"Garland","email":"cgarland@ucsd.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Scragg","email":"r.scragg@auckland.ac.nz","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edward","surname":"Giovannucci","email":"egiovann@hsph.harvard.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00430-009-0118-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel swine-origin influenza A virus in humans: another pandemic knocking at the door","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature08157","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Emergence and pandemic potential of swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Avian influenza: The tip of the iceberg","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1-Initial Molecular Signals for the Next Influenza Pandemic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1086/591851","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Developing New Antiviral Agents for Influenza Treatment: What does the Future Hold?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jclinepi.2008.07.001","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Inactivated influenza vaccines: methods, policies, and politics","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/QCO.0b013e3283199797","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The potential impact of neuraminidase inhibitor resistant influenza","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1506.081357","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Oseltamivir- and Amantadine-Resistant Influenza Viruses A (H1N1)","abstract":"Surveillance of amantadine and oseltamivir resistance among influenza viruses was begun in Hong Kong in 2006.
