Respirators","abstract":"Concerns have been raised regarding the availability of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) during an influenza pandemic.\n\n One possible strategy to mitigate a respirator shortage is to reuse FFRs following a biological decontamination process to render infectious material on the FFR inactive.\n\n However, little data exist on the effects of decontamination methods on respirator integrity and performance.\n\n This study evaluated five decontamination methods [ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), microwave oven irradiation, and bleach] using nine models of NIOSH-certified respirators (three models each of N95 FFRs, surgical N95 respirators, and P100 FFRs) to determine which methods should be considered for future research studies.\n\n Following treatment by each decontamination method, the FFRs were evaluated for changes in physical appearance, odor, and laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance).\n\n Additional experiments (dry heat laboratory oven exposures, off-gassing, and FFR hydrophobicity) were subsequently conducted to better understand material properties and possible health risks to the respirator user following decontamination.\n\n However, this study did not assess the efficiency of the decontamination methods to inactivate viable microorganisms.\n\n Microwave oven irradiation melted samples from two FFR models.\n\n The remainder of the FFR samples that had been decontaminated had expected levels of filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance.\n\n The scent of bleach remained noticeable following overnight drying and low levels of chlorine gas were found to off-gas from bleach-decontaminated FFRs when rehydrated with deionized water.\n\n UVGI, ethylene oxide (EtO), and VHP were found to be the most promising decontamination methods; however, concerns remain about the throughput capabilities for EtO and VHP.\n\n Further research is needed before any specific decontamination methods can be recommended.\n\n","id":"PMC2781738","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dennis

topic is covered to a limited extent in global reports such as the ones produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n In this article, we review the risk of climate-related impacts along the land-based livestock food supply chain.\n Although a quantification of the net impacts of climate change on the livestock sector is beyond the reach of our current understanding, there is strong evidence that there will be impacts throughout the supply chain, from farm production to processing operations, storage, transport, retailing and human consumption.\n The risks of climate-related impacts are highly context-specific but expected to be higher in environments that are already hot and have limited socio-economic and institutional resources for adaptation.\n Large uncertainties remain as to climate futures and the exposure and responses of the interlinked human and natural systems to climatic changes over time.\n Consequently, adaptation choices will need to account for a wide range of possible futures, including those with low probability but large

have been successfully tested to drive this transition: strong shocks and high energy femtolaser excitation.\n They induce it by increasing either pressure or temperature on graphite.\n In this work, we report a third method consisting in the irradiation of graphite with ultraviolet photons of energies above 4.4 eV.\n We show high resolution electron microscopy images of pyrolytic carbon evidencing the dislocation of the superficial graphitic layers after irradiation and the formation of crystallite islands within them.\n Electron energy loss spectroscopy of the islands show that the

play an important role in driving the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n To better understand how airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs, we sought to determine viral loads within coarse (&gt;5?m) and fine (?5?m) respiratory aerosols produced when breathing, talking, and singing.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing a G-II exhaled breath collector, we measured viral RNA in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients during 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking, and 15 minutes of singing.\n\n\nResults\nThirteen participants (59%) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic and 1 presymptomatic patient.\n\n Viral loads ranged from 63–5,821 N gene copies per expiratory activity per participant, with high person-to-person variation.\n\n Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA.\n\n Two participants, sampled on day 3 of illness, accounted for 52% of the total viral load.\n\n Overall, 94% of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies were emitted by talking and singing.\n\n Interestingly, 7 participants emitted more virus from talking than singing.\n\n Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85% of the viral load detected in our

SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\n\n Exposure to fine aerosols, especially indoors, should be mitigated.\n\n Isolating viable SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory aerosol samples remains challenging, and whether this

Large Mobile Air Purifiers on Aerosol Concentration in Classrooms and the Reduction of Airborne Transmission of SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased risk of infection by virus-containing aerosols indoors is assumed.\n Especially in schools, the duration of stay is long and the number of people in the rooms is large, increasing the risk of infection.\n This problem particularly affects schools without pre-installed ventilation systems that are equipped with filters and/or operate with fresh air.\n Here, the aerosol concentration is reduced by natural ventilation.\n In this context, we are investigating the effect of large mobile air purifiers (AP) with HEPA filters on particle concentration and their suitability for classroom use in a primary school in Germany.\n The three tested APs differ significantly in their air outlet characteristics.\n Measurements of the number of particles, the particle size distribution, and the CO2 concentration were carried out in the classroom with students (April/May 2021) and with an aerosol generator without students.\n In this regard, the use of APs leads to a substantial reduction of aerosol particles in the considered particle size range of 0.178–17.78 µm.\n At the same time, the three APs are found to have differences in their particle decay rate, noise level, and flow velocity.\n In addition to the measurements, the effect of various influencing parameters on the potential inhaled particle dose was investigated using a calculation model.\n The parameters considered include the duration of stay, particle concentration in exhaled air, respiratory flow rate, virus lifetime, ventilation interval, ventilation efficiency, AP volumetric flow, as well as room size.\n Based on the resulting effect diagrams, significant recommendations can be derived for reducing the risk of infection from virus-laden aerosols.\n Finally, the measurements were compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, as such tools can aid the optimal placement and configuration of APs and can be used to study the effect of the spread of aerosols from a source in the classroom.\n","id":"PMC8583054","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Finn

previously been impractical.\n However, such low-cost PM sensors tend to be poorly characterized, and their measurements of mass concentration can be subject to considerable error.\n Recent studies have investigated how individual factors can contribute to this error, but these studies are largely based on empirical comparisons and generally do not examine the role of multiple factors simultaneously.\n Here, we present a new physics-based framework and open-source software package (opcsim) for evaluating the ability of low-cost optical particle sensors (optical particle counters and nephelometers) to accurately characterize the size distribution and/or mass loading of aerosol particles.\n This framework, which uses Mie theory to calculate the response of a given sensor to a given particle population, is used to estimate the fractional error in mass loading for different sensor types given variations in relative humidity, aerosol optical properties, and the underlying particle size distribution.\n Results indicate that such error, which can be substantial, is dependent on the sensor technology (nephelometer vs.\n optical particle counter), the specific parameters of the individual sensor, and differences between the aerosol used to calibrate the sensor and the aerosol being measured.\n We conclude with a summary of likely sources of error for different sensor types, environmental conditions, and particle classes and offer general recommendations for the choice of calibrant under different measurement scenarios.\n","id":"PMC7995643","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David H.","surname":"Hagan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jesse

poorly ventilated classroom","abstract":"Many indoor places, including aged classrooms and offices, prisons, homeless shelters, etc.\n, are poorly ventilated but resource-limited to afford expensive ventilation upgrades or commercial air purification systems, raising concerns on the safety of opening activities in these places in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n To address this challenge, using computational fluid dynamics, we conducted a systematic investigation of airborne transmission in a classroom equipped with a single horizontal unit ventilator (HUV) and evaluate the performance of a low-cost box fan air cleaner for risk mitigation.\n Our study shows that placing box fan air cleaners in the classroom results in a substantial reduction of airborne transmission risk across the entire space.\n The air cleaner can achieve optimal performance when placed near the asymptomatic patient.\n However, without knowing the location of the patient, the performance of the cleaner is optimal near the HUV with the air flowing downwards.\n In addition, we find that it is more efficient in reducing aerosol concentration and spread in the classroom by adding air cleaners in comparison with raising the flow rate of HUV alone.\n The number and placement of air cleaners need to be adjusted to maintain their efficacy for larger classrooms and to account for the thermal gradient

environmental mitigation of aerosol viral load in a controlled chamber with participants diagnosed with COVID-19","abstract":"Background\nSeveral studies indicate that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted within indoor spaces.\n\n Therefore, environmental characterization of SARS-CoV-2 viral load with respect to human activity, building parameters, and environmental mitigation strategies is critical to combat disease transmission.\n\n\nMethods\nWe recruited 11 participants diagnosed with COVID-19 to individually occupy a controlled chamber and conduct specified physical activities under a range of environmental conditions; we collected human and environmental samples over a period of three days for each participant.\n\n\nResults\nHere we show that increased viral load, measured by lower RNA cycle threshold (CT) values, in nasal samples is associated with higher viral loads in environmental aerosols and on surfaces captured in both the near field (1.2 m) and far field (3.5 m).\n\n We also found that aerosol viral load in far field is correlated with the number of particles within the range of 1 µm -2.5 µm.\n\n Furthermore, we found that increased ventilation and filtration significantly reduced aerosol and surface viral loads, while higher relative humidity resulted in lower aerosol and higher surface viral load, consistent with an increased rate of particle deposition at higher relative humidity.\n\n Data from near field aerosol trials with high expiratory activities suggest that respiratory particles of smaller sizes (0.3 µm -1 µm) best characterize the variance of near field aerosol viral load.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings indicate that building operation practices such as ventilation, filtration, and humidification substantially reduce the environmental aerosol viral load, and therefore inhalation dose, and should be prioritized to improve building health and safety.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8755398","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hooman","surname":"Parhizkar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leslie","surname":"Dietz","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Leslie","surname":"Dietz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Olsen-Martinez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patrick

facepiece respirators (FFRs) has been suggested as a strategy to conserve available supplies for home and healthcare environments during an influenza pandemic.\n\n For reuse to be possible, used FFRs must be decontaminated before redonning to reduce the risk of virus transmission; however, there are no approved methods for FFR decontamination.\n\n An effective method must reduce the microbial threat, maintain the function of the FFR, and present no residual chemical hazard.\n\n The method should be readily available, inexpensive and easily implemented by healthcare workers and the general public.\n\n Many of the general decontamination protocols used in healthcare and home settings are unable to address all of the desired qualities of an efficient FFR decontamination protocol.\n\n The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of two commercially available steam bags, marketed to the public for disinfecting infant feeding equipment, for FFR decontamination.\n\n The FFRs were decontaminated with microwave generated steam following the manufacturers' instructions then evaluated for water absorption and filtration efficiency for up to three steam exposures.\n\n Water absorption of the FFR was found to be model specific as FFRs constructed with hydrophilic materials absorbed more water.\n\n The steam had little effect on FFR performance as filtration efficiency of the treated FFRs remained above 95%.\n\n The decontamination efficacy of the steam bag was assessed using bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate for a pathogenic virus.\n\n The tested steam bags were found to be 99.9% effective for inactivating MS2 on FFRs; however, more research is required to determine the effectiveness against respiratory pathogens.\n\n","id":"PMC3078131","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Edward

California hospitals during the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic","abstract":"Background\nEmergence of the novel 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus in California led to an evaluation of hospital respiratory protection programs (RPPs) and practices by the California Department of Public Health during the 2009-2010 influenza season.\n\n\nMethods\nOnsite evaluation of 16 hospitals consisted of interviews with managers and health care workers about RPPs and practices, review of written RPPs, and limited observations of personnel using respirators.\n\n Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n\n\nResults\nAll hospitals had implemented policies requiring the minimum use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators when working with patients with H1N1 virus infection; 95.5% of health care workers (n = 199) reported they would wear at least this level of protection when in close contact with a patient with confirmed or suspected H1N1 virus infection.\n\n However, evaluation of written RPPs indicated deficiencies in required areas, most commonly in recordkeeping, designation of a program administrator, program evaluation, employee training, and fit testing procedures.\n\n\nConclusions\nHealth care workers were aware of respiratory protection required when providing care for patients with confirmed or suspected H1N1 virus infection.\n\n Hospitals should improve written RPPs, fully implement written procedures, and conduct periodic program evaluation to ensure effectiveness of respirator use for health care worker protection.\n\n Increased accessibility of resources tailored for hospital respirator program administrators may be helpful.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4615716","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stella","surname":"Beckman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Barbara","surname":"Materna","email":"barbara.materna@cdph.ca.gov","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Suzi","surname":"Goldmacher","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jennifer","surname":"Zipprich","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maryann","surname":"D'Alessandro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Debra","surname":"Novak","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Harrison","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajic.2015.02.009","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Disinfection

inactivation of SARS coronavirus","abstract":"The SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a newly emerged, highly pathogenic agent that caused over 8,000 human infections with nearly 800 deaths between November 2002 and September 2003. While direct person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets accounted for most cases, other modes have not been ruled out.\n Faecal shedding is common and prolonged and has caused an outbreak in Hong Kong.\n We studied the stability of SARS-CoV under different conditions, both in suspension and dried on surfaces, in comparison with other human-pathogenic viruses, including human coronavirus HCoV-229E.\n In suspension, HCoV-229E gradually lost its infectivity completely while SARS-CoV retained its infectivity for up to 9 days; in the dried state, survival times were 24 h versus 6 days.\n Thermal inactivation at 56°C was highly effective in the absence of protein, reducing the virus titre to below detectability; however, the addition of 20% protein exerted a protective effect resulting in residual infectivity.\n If protein-containing solutions are to be inactivated, heat treatment at 60°C for at least 30 min must be used.\n Different fixation procedures, e.\ng.\n for the preparation of immunofluorescence slides, as well as chemical means of virus inactivation commonly used in hospital and laboratory settings were generally found to be effective.\n Our investigations confirm that it is possible to care for SARS patients and to conduct laboratory scientific studies on SARS-CoV safely.\n Nevertheless, the agent’s tenacity is considerably higher than that of HCoV-229E, and should SARS re-emerge, increased efforts need to be devoted to questions of environmental hygiene.\n","id":"PMC7086689","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"H.

of mask, gloves, gowns, and hand-washing, as recommended under droplets and contact precautions when caring for index patients with SARS.\n 69 staff who reported use of all four measures were not infected, whereas all infected staff had omitted at least one measure (p=0·0224).\n Fewer staff who wore masks (p=0·0001), gowns (p=0·006), and washed their hands (p=0·047) became infected compared with those who didn't, but stepwise logistic regression was significant only for masks (p=0·011).\n Practice of droplets precaution and contact precaution is adequate in significantly reducing the risk of infection after exposures to patients with SARS.\n The protective role of the mask suggests that in hospitals, infection is transmitted by droplets.\n","id":"PMC7112437","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"WH","surname":"Seto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"D","surname":"Tsang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"RWH","surname":"Yung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"TY","surname":"Ching","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"TK","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"M","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"LM","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"JSM","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Seroprevalence

Integrity","abstract":"The ability to disinfect and reuse disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) may be needed during a pandemic of an infectious respiratory disease such as influenza.\n Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is one possible method for respirator disinfection.\n However, UV radiation degrades polymers, which presents the possibility that UVGI exposure could degrade the ability of a disposable respirator to protect the worker.\n To study this, we exposed both sides of material coupons and respirator straps from four models of N95 FFRs to UVGI doses from 120–950 J/cm2.\n We then tested the particle penetration, flow resistance, and bursting strengths of the individual respirator coupon layers, and the breaking strength of the respirator straps.\n We found that UVGI exposure led to a small increase in particle penetration (up to 1.25%) and had little effect on the flow resistance.\n UVGI exposure had a more pronounced effect on the strengths of the respirator materials.\n At the higher UVGI doses, the strength of the layers of respirator material was substantially reduced (in some cases, by &gt;90%).\n The changes in the strengths of the respirator materials varied considerably among the different models of respirators.\n UVGI had less of an effect on the respirator straps; a dose of 2360 J/cm2 reduced the breaking strength of the straps by 20–51%.\n Our results suggest that UVGI could be used to effectively disinfect disposable respirators for reuse, but the maximum number of disinfection cycles will be limited by the respirator model and the UVGI dose required to inactivate the pathogen.\n","id":"PMC4699414","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"William

set standards in the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\n\n Our aim was to evaluate the impact of PRISMA endorsement on the quality of reporting and methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published in journals in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology (GH).\n\n\nMethods\nQuality of reporting and methodological quality were evaluated by assessing the adherence of papers to PRISMA checklist and AMSTAR quality scale.\n\n After identifying the GH journals which endorsed PRISMA in instructions for authors (IA), we appraised: 15 papers published in 2012 explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group A); 15 papers from the same journals published in 2012 not explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group B); 30 papers published the year preceding PRISMA endorsement from the same journals as above (Group C); 30 papers published in 2012 on the 10 highest impact factor journals in GH which not endorsed PRISMA (Group D).\n\n\nResults\nPRISMA statement was referred in the IA in 9 out of 70 GH journals (12.9%).\n\n We found significant increase in overall adherence to PRISMA checklist (Group A, 90.1%; Group C, 83.1%; p?=?0.003) and compliance to AMSTAR scale (Group A, 85.0%; Group C, 74.6%; p?=?0.002), following the PRISMA endorsement from the nine GH journals.\n\n Explicit referencing of PRISMA in manuscript was not associated with increase in quality of reporting and methodological quality (Group A vs.\n\n B, p?=?0.651, p?=?0.900, respectively).\n\n Adherence to PRISMA checklist, and the compliance with AMSTAR were significantly higher in journals endorsing PRISMA compared to those not (Groups A+B vs.\n\n D; p?=?0.003 and p?=?0.016, respectively).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe endorsement of PRISMA resulted in increase of both quality of reporting and methodological quality.\n\n It is advised that an increasing number of medical journals include PRISMA in the instructions for

and meta-analyses published in nursing journals: a cross-sectional study","abstract":"Objective\nSystematic reviews (SRs) often poorly report key information, thereby diminishing their usefulness.\n\n Previous studies evaluated published SRs and determined that they failed to meet explicit criteria or characteristics.\n\n The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was recommended as a reporting guideline for SR and meta-analysis (MA), but previous studies showed that adherence to the statement was not high for SRs published in different medical fields.\n\n Thus, the aims of this study are twofold: (1) to investigate the number of nursing journals that have required or recommended the use of the PRISMA statement for reporting SR, and (2) to examine the adherence of SRs and/or meta-analyses to the PRISMA statement published in nursing journals.\n\n\nDesign\nA cross-sectional study.\n\n\nMethods\nNursing journals listed in the ISI journal citation report were divided into 2 groups based on the recommendation of PRISMA statement in their ‘Instruction for Authors’.\n\n SRs and meta-analyses published in 2014 were searched in 3 databases.\n\n 37 SRs and meta-analyses were randomly selected in each group.\n\n The adherence of each item to the PRISMA was examined and summarised using descriptive statistics.\n\n The quality of the SRs was assessed by Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews.\n\n The differences between the 2 groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.\n\n\nResults\nOut of 107 nursing journals, 30 (28.0%) recommended or required authors to follow the PRISMA statement when they submit SRs or meta-analyses.\n\n The median rates of adherence to the PRISMA statement for reviews published in journals with and without PRISMA endorsement were 64.9% (IQR: 17.6–92.3%) and 73.0% (IQR: 59.5–94.6%), respectively.\n\n No significant difference was observed in any of the items between the 2 groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe median adherence of SRs and meta-analyses in nursing journals to PRISMA is low at 64.9% and 73.0%, respectively.\n\n Nonetheless, the adherence level of nursing journals to the PRISMA statement does not significantly vary whether they endorse or recommend such a guideline.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5306529","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wilson W S","surname":"Tam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kenneth K

Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement was published to help authors improve how they report systematic reviews.\n\n It is unknown how many journals mention PRISMA in their instructions to authors, or whether stronger journal language regarding use of PRISMA improves author compliance.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nAn Internet-based investigation examined the extent to which 146 leading medical journals have incorporated the PRISMA Statement into their instructions to authors.\n\n Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n\n Also, systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals and the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses) Statement were used to explore the hypothesis that indicating compliance with the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript is associated with improved compliance with the reporting guideline.\n\n In a sample of 146 journals publishing systematic reviews, the PRISMA Statement was referred to in the instructions to authors for 27% (40/146) of journals; more often in general and internal medicine journals (7/14; 50%) than in specialty medicine journals (33/132; 25%).\n\n In the second part of the study, 13 systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals in 2008 were included for appraisal.\n\n Mention of the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript was associated with higher compliance with the QUOROM checklist (P?=?0.022).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nMost of the leading medical journals used ambiguous language regarding what was expected of authors.\n\n Further improvement on quality of reporting of systematic reviews may entail journals clearly informing authors of their requirements.\n\n Stronger directions, such as requiring an indication of adherence to a research quality of reporting statement in the manuscript, may improve reporting and utility of systematic reviews.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3217994","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kun-ming","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiao-qian","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing-hui","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Moher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-quan","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei-feng","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert

however, there are no approved methods for FFR decontamination.\n An effective method must reduce the microbial threat, maintain the function of the FFR, and present no residual chemical hazard.\n The method should be readily available, inexpensive and easily implemented by healthcare workers and the general public.\n Many of the general decontamination protocols used in healthcare and home settings are unable to address all of the desired qualities of an efficient FFR decontamination protocol.\n The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of two commercially available steam bags, marketed to the public for disinfecting infant feeding equipment, for FFR decontamination.\n The FFRs were decontaminated with microwave generated steam following the manufacturers' instructions then evaluated for water absorption and filtration efficiency for up to three steam exposures.\n Water absorption of the FFR was found to be model specific as FFRs constructed with hydrophilic materials absorbed more water.\n The steam had little effect on FFR performance as filtration efficiency of the treated FFRs remained above 95%.\n The decontamination efficacy of the steam bag was assessed using bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate for a pathogenic virus.\n The tested steam bags were found to be 99.9% effective for inactivating MS2 on FFRs;

facepiece respirator (FFR) is commonly used to protect individuals from infectious aerosols.\n Health care experts predict a shortage of N95 FFRs if a severe pandemic occurs, and an option that has been suggested for mitigating such an FFR shortage is to decontaminate and reuse the devices.\n Before the effectiveness of this strategy can be established, many parameters affecting respiratory protection must be measured: biocidal efficacy of the decontamination treatment, filtration performance, pressure drop, fit, and toxicity to the end user post treatment.\n This research effort measured the amount of residual chemicals created or deposited on six models of FFRs following treatment by each of 7 simple decontamination technologies.\n Measured amounts of decontaminants retained by the FFRs treated with chemical disinfectants were small enough that exposure to wearers will be below the permissible exposure limit (PEL).\n Toxic by-products were also evaluated, and two suspected toxins were detected after ethylene oxide treatment of FFR rubber straps.\n The results provide encouragement to efforts promoting the evolution of effective strategies for decontamination and reuse of FFRs.\n","id":"PMC7196687","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"W.B.","surname":"Salter","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"K.","surname":"Kinney","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"W.H.","surname":"Wallace","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.E.","surname":"Lumley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"B.K.","surname":"Heimbuch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.D.","surname":"Wander","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References

aerosol particles: Effects of five decontamination methods","abstract":"This study investigates the effects of five decontamination methods on the filter quality (qf) of three commercially available electret masks—N95, Gauze and Spunlace nonwoven masks.\n Newly developed evaluation methods, the overall filter quality (qf,o) and the qf ratio were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of decontamination methods for respirators.\n A scanning mobility particle sizer is utilized to measure the concentration of polydispersed particles with diameter 14.6–594 nm.\n The penetration of particles and pressure drop (?p) through the mask are used to determine qf and qf,o.\n Experimental results reveal that the most penetrating particle size (MPS) for the pre-decontaminated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks were 118 nm, 461 nm and 279 nm, respectively, and the respective penetration rates were 2.6%, 23.2% and 70.0%.\n The ?p through the pretreated N95 masks was 9.2 mm H2O at the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers, exceeding the ?p values obtained through Gauze and Spunlace masks.\n Decontamination increased the sizes of the most penetrating particles, changing the qf values of all of the masks: qf fell as particle size increased because the penetration increased.\n Bleach increased the ?p of N95, but destroyed the Gauze mask.\n However, the use of an autoclave reduces the ?p values of both the N95 and the Gauze mask.\n Neither the rice cooker nor ethanol altered the ?p of the Gauze mask.\n Chemical decontamination methods reduced the qf,o values for the three electret masks.\n The value of qf,o for PM0.1 exceeded that for PM0.1–0.6, because particles smaller than 100 nm had lower penetration, resulting in a better qf for a given pressure drop.\n The values of qf,o, particularly for PM0.1, reveal that for the tested treatments and masks, physical decontamination methods are less destructive to the filter than chemical methods.\n Nevertheless, when purchasing new or reusing FFRs, penetration should be regarded as the priority.\n","id":"PMC5638397","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tzu-Hsien","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chih-Chieh","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sheng-Hsiu","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chung-Wen","surname":"Kuo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chung-Wen","surname":"Kuo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chane-Yu","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wen-Yinn","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amitava","surname":"Mukherjee","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Amitava","surname":"Mukherjee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

respirator (FFR) after decontamination by five methods under worst?case conditions.\n Relative survival was obtained by testing after decontamination and after storing the FFRs at 37°C and 95% relative humidity for 24 hours.\n The decontamination methods involved ethanol, bleach, ultraviolet irradiation (UVA 365 nm, UVC 254 nm), an autoclave, and a traditional electric rice cooker (TERC) that was made in Taiwan.\n Without decontamination, 59 ± 8% of the loaded spores survived for 24 hours.\n When 70% ethanol was added to the N95 FFR at a packing density of 0.23, the RS was 73 ± 5% initially and decayed to 22 ± 8% in 24 hours.\n Relative survival remained above 20% after 20 minutes of UVA irradiation.\n The other four decontamination measures achieved 99%?100% biocidal efficacy,

aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of cloth masks to medical masks in hospital healthcare workers (HCWs).\n\n The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between medical masks and cloth masks.\n\n\nSetting\n14 secondary-level/tertiary-level hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam.\n\n\nParticipants\n1607 hospital HCWs aged ?18?years working full-time in selected high-risk wards.\n\n\nIntervention\nHospital wards were randomised to: medical masks, cloth masks or a control group (usual practice, which included mask wearing).\n\n Participants used the mask on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks.\n\n\nMain outcome measure\nClinical respiratory illness (CRI), influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection.\n\n\nResults\nThe rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm.\n\n Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm.\n\n An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group.\n\n Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks.\n\n This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety.\n\n Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection.\n\n Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally.\n\n However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.\n\n\nTrial

ongoing debate and limited evidence on the use of masks and respirators for the prevention of respiratory infections in health care workers (HCWs).\n\n This study aimed to examine available policies and guidelines around the use of masks and respirators in HCWs and to describe areas of consistency between guidelines, as well as gaps in the recommendations, with reference to the WHO and the CDC guidelines.\n\n\nMethods\nPolicies and guidelines related to mask and respirator use for the prevention of influenza, SARS and TB were examined.\n\n Guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), three high-income countries and six low/middle-income countries were selected.\n\n\nResults\nUniform recommendations are made by the WHO and the CDC in regards to protecting HCWs against seasonal influenza (a mask for low risk situations and a respirator for high risk situations) and TB (use of a respirator).\n\n However, for pandemic influenza and SARS, the WHO recommends mask use in low risk and respirators in high risk situations, whereas, the CDC recommends respirators in both low and high risk situations.\n\n Amongst the nine countries reviewed, there are variations in the recommendations for all three diseases.\n\n While, some countries align with the WHO recommendations, others align with those made by the CDC.\n\n The choice of respirator and the level of filtering ability vary amongst the guidelines and the different diseases.\n\n Lastly, none of the policies discuss reuse, extended use or the use of cloth masks.\n\n\nConclusion\nCurrently, there are significant variations in the policies and recommendations around mask and respirator use for protection against influenza, SARS and TB.\n\n These differences may reflect the scarcity of level-one evidence available to inform policy development.\n\n The lack of any guidelines on the use of cloth masks, despite widespread use in many low and middle-income countries, remains a policy gap.\n\n Health organizations and countries should jointly evaluate the available evidence, prioritize research to inform evidence gaps, and develop consistent policy on masks and respirator use in the health care setting.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3693993","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Abrar

filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) may not be adequate to match demand during a pandemic outbreak.\n One possible strategy to maintain supplies in healthcare settings is to extend FFR use for multiple patient encounters; however, contaminated FFRs may serve as a source for the airborne transmission of virus particles.\n In this study, reaerosolization of virus particles from contaminated FFRs was examined using bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate for airborne pathogenic viruses.\n MS2 was applied to FFRs as droplets or droplet nuclei.\n A simulated cough (370 l min?1 peak flow) provided reverse airflow through the contaminated FFR.\n The number and size of the reaerosolized particles were measured using gelatin filters and an Andersen Cascade Impactor (ACI).\n Two droplet nuclei challenges produced higher percentages of reaerosolized particles (0.21 and 0.08%) than a droplet challenge (&lt;0.0001%).\n Overall, the ACI-determined size distribution of the reaerosolized particles was larger than the characterized loading virus aerosol.\n This study demonstrates that only a small percentage of viable MS2 viruses was reaerosolized from FFRs by reverse airflow under the conditions evaluated, suggesting that the risks of exposure due to reaerosolization associated with extended use can be considered negligible for most respiratory viruses.\n However, risk assessments should be updated as new viruses emerge and better workplace exposure data becomes available.\n","id":"PMC7537697","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Edward

infection control practices in a high-burden metro in South Africa: A perpetual bane for efficient primary health care service delivery","abstract":"Background\nTuberculosis (TB) prevention, including infection control, is a key element in the strategy to end the global TB epidemic.\n\n While effective infection control requires all health system components to function well, this is an area that has not received sufficient attention in South Africa despite the availability of policy and guidelines.\n\n\nAim\nTo describe the state of implementation of TB infection control measures in a high-burden metro in South Africa.\n\n\nSetting\nThe research was undertaken in a high TB- and HIV-burdened metropolitan area of South Africa.\n\n More specifically, the study sites were primary health care facilities (PHC), that among other services also diagnosed TB.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey, focusing on the World Health Organization levels of infection control, which included structured interviews with nurses providing TB diagnosis and treatment services as well as observations, at all 41 PHC facilities in a high TB-burdened and HIV-burdened metro of South Africa.\n\n\nResults\nTuberculosis infection control was poorly implemented, with few facilities scoring 80% and above on compliance with infection control measures.\n\n Facility controls: 26 facilities (63.4%) had an infection control committee and 12 (29.3%) had a written infection control plan.\n\n Administrative controls: 26 facilities (63.4%) reported separating coughing and non-coughing patients, while observations revealed that only 11 facilities (26.8%) had separate waiting areas for (presumptive) TB patients.\n\n Environmental controls: most facilities used open windows for ventilation (n = 30; 73.2%); however, on the day of the visit, only 12 facilities (30.3%) had open windows in consulting rooms.\n\n Personal protective equipment: 9 facilities (22%) did not have any disposable respirators in stock and only 9 respondents (22%) had undergone fit testing.\n\n The most frequently reported barrier to implementing good TB infection control practices was lack of equipment (n = 22; 40%) such as masks and disposable respirators, as well as the structure or layout of the PHC facilities.\n\n The main recommendation to improve TB infection control was education for patients and health care workers (n = 18; 33.3%).\n\n\nConclusion\nAll levels of the health care system should be engaged to address TB prevention and infection control in PHC facilities.\n\n Improved infection control will address the nosocomial spread of TB in health facilities and keep health care workers and patients safe from infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6018120","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Michelle

skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility.\n\n Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented.\n\n Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively.\n\n The

14.6–594 nm.\n The penetration of particles and pressure drop (?p) through the mask are used to determine qf and qf,o.\n Experimental results reveal that the most penetrating particle size (MPS) for the pre-decontaminated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks were 118 nm, 461 nm and 279 nm, respectively, and the respective penetration rates were 2.6%, 23.2% and 70.0%.\n The ?p through the pretreated N95 masks was 9.2 mm H2O at the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers, exceeding the ?p values obtained through Gauze and Spunlace masks.\n Decontamination increased the sizes of the most penetrating particles, changing the qf values of all of the masks: qf fell as particle size increased because the penetration increased.\n Bleach increased the ?p of N95, but destroyed the Gauze mask.\n However, the use of an autoclave reduces the ?p values of both the N95 and the Gauze mask.\n Neither the rice cooker nor ethanol altered the ?p of the Gauze mask.\n Chemical decontamination methods reduced the qf,o values for the three electret masks.\n The value of qf,o for PM0.1 exceeded that for PM0.1–0.6, because particles smaller than 100 nm had lower penetration, resulting in a better qf for a given pressure drop.\n The values of qf,o, particularly for PM0.1, reveal that for the tested treatments and masks, physical decontamination methods are less destructive to the filter than chemical methods.\n Nevertheless, when purchasing new or reusing FFRs, penetration should be regarded as the priority.\n","id":"PMC5638397","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tzu-Hsien","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chih-Chieh","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sheng-Hsiu","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chung-Wen","surname":"Kuo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chung-Wen","surname":"Kuo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chane-Yu","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-Yinn","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amitava","surname":"Mukherjee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amitava","surname":"Mukherjee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evaluation

a dose of 2360 J/cm2 reduced the breaking strength of the straps by 20–51%.\n Our results suggest that UVGI could be used to effectively disinfect disposable respirators for reuse, but the maximum number of disinfection cycles will be limited by the respirator model and the UVGI dose required to inactivate the pathogen.\n","id":"PMC4699414","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"William G.","surname":"Lindsley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephen B.","surname":"Martin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert E.","surname":"Thewlis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Khachatur","surname":"Sarkisian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Julian O.","surname":"Nwoko","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kenneth R.","surname":"Mead","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John D.","surname":"Noti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Disinfection of Filtering Facepiece Respirators Technical Bulletin","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajic.2016.10.006","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evaluation of an automated room decontamination device using aerosolized peracetic acid","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajic.2019.11.029","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Efficacy of a multi-purpose high level disinfection cabinet against Candida auris and other health care-associated pathogens","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1017/ice.2019.161","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Understanding ultraviolet light surface decontamination in hospital rooms: A primer","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajic.2019.03.005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Decontamination devices in health care facilities: Practical issues and emerging applications","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jhin.2017.07.034","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effectiveness of automated ultraviolet-C light for decontamination of textiles inoculated with Enterococcus faecium","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/jam.12777","date":"2015-02-07","title":"Evaluation of eluents for the recovery of an enveloped virus from hands by whole?hand sampling","abstract":"Aims\nThe objective of this research is to evaluate eluents for recovery of an enveloped bacteriophage, ?6, using whole?hand sampling.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nVirus was applied to the hands of volunteers and sampled by the glove juice method with 1·5% beef extract (BE), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0·01 and 0·1% Tween 80, tryptic soy broth (TSB) and 9% NaCl.\n\n Each volunteer underwent multiple rounds application and hand sampling.\n\n Mean log10 virus loss across trials was 2·6 for BE, 2·8 for PBS, 2·4 for TSB, 3·8 for NaCl, 3·0 for 0·1% Tween 80, and 2·9 for 0·01% Tween 80.

on a perpendicular TLC plate coated with either healthy or diseased simulated nasal mucus.\n After actuation of the nasal spray, the dripping of the formulation on the coated TLC plate was measured after the plate was repositioned vertically.\n The method that was developed generated reproducible results on the dripping behavior of nasal formulations and provided critical information about the

ranging from 70 to 130°C for 0 to 90 min depending on the virus, and then the recovered viral preparations were tittered.\n Inactivation rates were calculated from curves that were analysed according to the first order kinetics model.\n Full inactivation was obtained for MVM in 90 min at 80°C and in 2 s at 130°C, for H1N1 in 14 s at 70°C and in 1 s at 110°C, for CVB4 and HSV-1 in 5 s and 7 s respectively at 70°C and in 1 s at 100°C.\n Clearly, MVM was more resistant than H1N1 that was more resistant than HSV-1 and CVB4, which was reflected by increasing inactivation rates.\n The impact of short time exposure to heat onto the infectivity of viruses contained in a small volume of suspension has been determined.\n For the first time, the inactivation of viral particles contained in drops

widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers, including filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) such as N95 masks.\n\n These masks are normally intended for single use, but their sterilization and subsequent reuse could substantially mitigate a world-wide shortage.\n\n\nDesign:\nid='P9'>Quality assurance.\n\n\nSetting:\nid='P10'>A sealed environment chamber installed in the animal facility of an academic medical center.\n\n\nInterventions:\nid='P11'>One to five sterilization cycles using ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), generated by SteraMist® equipment (TOMI; Frederick, MD).\n\n\nMain outcome measures:\nid='P12'>Personal protective equipment, including five N95 mask models from three manufacturers, were evaluated for efficacy of sterilization following iHP treatment (measured with bacterial spores in standard biological indicator assemblies).\n\n Additionally, N95 masks were assessed for their ability to efficiently filter particles down to 0.3?m and for their ability to form an airtight seal using a quantitative fit test.\n\n Filtration efficiency was measured using ambient particulate matter at a university lab and an aerosolized NaCl challenge at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pre-certification laboratory.\n\n\nResults:\nid='P13'>The data demonstrate that N95 masks sterilized using SteraMist iHP technology retain function up to five cycles, the maximum number tested to date.\n\n Some but not all PPE could also be sterilized using an iHP environmental chamber, but pre-treatment with a handheld iHP generator was required for semi-enclosed surfaces such as respirator hoses.\n\n\nConclusions:\nid='P14'>A typical iHP environment chamber with a volume of ~80 m3 can treat ~7000 masks per day, as well as other items of PPE, making this an effective approach for a busy medical center.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7273248","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Avilash

equipment for their selective reuse during pandemics","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is required to safely work with biological agents of bacterial (i.\n\ne.\n\n Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or viral origin (Ebola and SARS).\n\n COVID-19 pandemic especially has created unforeseen public health challenges including a global shortage of PPE needed for the safety of health care workers (HCWs).\n\n Although sufficient stocks of PPE are currently available, their critical shortage may develop soon due to increase in demand and depletion of existing supply lines.\n\n To empower our HCWs and ensure their continued protection, proactive measures are urgently required to develop procedures to safely decontaminate the PPEs to allow their “selective reuse” during contingency situations.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Herein, we have successfully developed a decontamination method based on vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP).\n\n We have used a range of concentration of hydrogen peroxide to disinfect PPE (coveralls, face-shields, and N-95 masks).\n\n To ensure a proper disinfection, we have evaluated three biological indicators namely Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis and spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus, considered as the gold standard for disinfection processes.\n\n We next evaluated the impact of repeated VHP treatment on physical features, permeability, and fabric integrity of coveralls and N-95 masks.\n\n Next, we performed Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to evaluate microscopic changes in fiber thickness of N-95 masks, melt blown layer or coverall body suits.\n\n Considering the fact that any disinfection procedure should be able to meet local requirements, our study included various regionally procured N-95 masks and coveralls available at our institute All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.\n\n Lastly, the practical utility of VHP method developed herein was ascertained by operationalizing a dedicated research facility disinfecting used PPE during COVID-19.\nResults\nid='Par3'>Our prototype studies show that a single VHP cycle (7–8% Hydrogen peroxide) could disinfect PPE and PPE housing room of about 1200 cubic feet (length10 ft?×?breadth 10 ft?×?height 12 ft) in less than 10 min, as noted by a complete loss of B.\n\n stearothermophilus spore revival.\n\n The results are consistent and reproducible as tested in over 10 cycles in our settings.\n\n Further, repeated VHP treatment did not result in any physical tear, deformity or other appreciable change in the coverall and N-95 masks.\n\n Our permeation tests evaluating droplet penetration did not reveal any change in permeability post-VHP treatments.\n\n Also, SEM analysis indeed revealed no significant change in fiber thickness or damage to fibers of coveralls or melt blown layer of N-95 masks essential for filtration.\n\n There was no change in user comfort and experience following VHP treatment of PPE.\n\n Based on results of these studies, and parameters developed and optimized, an institutional research facility to disinfect COVID-19 PPE is successfully established and operationalized with more than 80% recovery rate for used PPE post-disinfection.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Our study, therefore, successfully establishes the utility of VHP to effectively disinfect PPE for a possible reuse as per the requirements.\n\n VHP treatment did not damage coveralls, cause physical deformity and also did not alter fabric architecture of melt blown layer.\n\n We observed that disinfection process was successful consistently and therefore believe that the VHP-based decontamination model will have a universal applicability and utility.\n\n This process can be easily and economically scaled up and can be instrumental in easing global PPE shortages in any biosafety facility or in health care settings during pandemic situation such as COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7303439","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Vikram","surname":"Saini","email":"vikram@aiims.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kriti","surname":"Sikri","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Kriti","surname":"Sikri","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sakshi

Taxonomic Analysis Establishes <italic>Mycobacterium indicus pranii</italic> as a Distinct Species","abstract":"Background\n\nMycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), popularly known as Mw, is a cultivable, non-pathogenic organism, which, based on its growth and metabolic properties, is classified in Runyon Group IV along with M.\n\n fortuitum, M.\n\n smegmatis and M.\n\n vaccae.\n\n The novelty of this bacterium was accredited to its immunological ability to undergo antigen driven blast transformation of leukocytes and delayed hypersensitivity skin test in leprosy patients, a disease endemic in the Indian sub-continent.\n\n Consequently, MIP has been extensively evaluated for its biochemical and immunological properties leading to its usage as an immunomodulator in leprosy and tuberculosis patients.\n\n However, owing to advances in sequencing and culture techniques, the citing of new strains with almost 100% similarity in the sequences of marker genes like 16S rRNA, has compromised the identity of MIP as a novel species.\n\n Hence, to define its precise taxonomic position, we have carried out polyphasic taxonomic studies on MIP that integrate its phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular phylogenetic attributes.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nThe comparative analysis of 16S rRNA sequence of MIP by using BLAST algorithm at NCBI (nr database) revealed a similarity of ?99% with M.\n\n intracellulare, M.\n\n arosiense, M.\n\n chimaera, M.\n\n seoulense, M.\n\n avium subsp.\n\n hominissuis, M.\n\n avium subsp.\n\n paratuberculosis and M.\n\n bohemicum.\n\n Further analysis with other widely used markers like rpoB and hsp65 could resolve the phylogenetic relationship between MIP and other closely related mycobacteria apart from M.\n\n intracellulare and M.\n\n chimaera, which shares ?99% similarity with corresponding MIP orthologues.\n\n Molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on the concatenation of candidate orthologues of 16S rRNA, hsp65 and rpoB, also substantiated its distinctiveness from all the related organisms used in the analysis excluding M.\n\n intracellulare and M.\n\n chimaera with which it exhibited a close proximity.\n\n This necessitated further analysis of MIP with more sensitive and segregating parameters to ascertain its precise taxonomic position as a new species.\n\n The analysis of MIP and its comparison with other mycobacterial reference strains based on cellular and biochemical features, growth characteristics and chemotaxonomic studies like FAME profiling confirmed that MIP is uniquely endowed with diverse metabolic attributes that effectively distinguishes it from all the closely related mycobacteria including M.\n\n intracellulare and M.\n\n chimaera.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe results presented in this study coupled with the non-pathogenic nature and different biochemical and immunomodulatory properties of MIP affirm it as a distinct species belonging to M.\n\n avium complex (MAC).\n\n It is further proposed to use an earlier suggested name Mycobacterium indicus pranii for this newly established mycobacterial species.\n\n This study also exemplifies the growing need for a uniform, consensus based broader polyphasic frame work for the purpose of taxonomy and speciation, particularly in the genus Mycobacterium.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2707620","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Vikram","surname":"Saini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Saurabh","surname":"Raghuvanshi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Gursaran

saprophytic mycobacteria.\n\n The ability of mycobacteria to colonize hosts, to proliferate and to cause diseases has evolved due to its predisposition to various evolutionary forces acting over a period of time.\n\n Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), a taxonomically unknown ‘generalist’ mycobacterium, acts as an immunotherapeutic against leprosy and is approved for use as a vaccine against it.\n\n The large-scale field trials of this MIP based leprosy vaccine coupled with its demonstrated immunomodulatory and adjuvant property has led to human clinical evaluations of MIP in interventions against HIV-AIDS, psoriasis and bladder cancer.\n\n MIP, commercially available as ‘Immuvac’, is currently the focus of advanced phase III clinical trials for its antituberculosis efficacy.\n\n Thus a comprehensive analysis of MIP vis-à-vis evolutionary path, underpinning its immanent immunomodulating properties is of the highest desiderata.\n\n\nPrincipal Findings\nGenome wide comparisons together with molecular phylogenetic analyses by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP), enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) based genotyping and candidate orthologues sequencing revealed that MIP has been the predecessor of highly pathogenic Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex (MAIC) that did not resort to parasitic adaptation by reductional gene evolution and therefore, preferred a free living life-style.\n\n Further analysis suggested a shared aquatic phase of MAIC bacilli with the early pathogenic forms of Mycobacterium, well before the latter diverged as ‘specialists’.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThis evolutionary paradigm possibly affirms to marshal our understanding about the acquisition and optimization of

during an influenza pandemic.\n One possible strategy to mitigate a respirator shortage is to reuse FFRs following a biological decontamination process to render infectious material on the FFR inactive.\n However, little data exist on the effects of decontamination methods on respirator integrity and performance.\n This study evaluated five decontamination methods [ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), microwave oven irradiation, and bleach] using nine models of NIOSH-certified respirators (three models each of N95 FFRs, surgical N95 respirators, and P100 FFRs) to determine which methods should be considered for future research studies.\n Following treatment by each decontamination method, the FFRs were evaluated for changes in physical appearance, odor, and laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance).\n Additional experiments (dry heat laboratory oven exposures, off-gassing, and FFR hydrophobicity) were subsequently conducted to better understand material properties and possible health risks to the respirator user following decontamination.\n However, this study did not assess the efficiency of the decontamination methods to inactivate viable microorganisms.\n Microwave oven irradiation melted samples from two FFR models.\n The remainder of the FFR samples that had been decontaminated had expected levels of filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance.\n The scent of bleach remained noticeable following overnight drying and low levels of chlorine gas were found to off-gas from bleach-decontaminated FFRs when rehydrated with deionized water.\n UVGI, ethylene oxide (EtO), and VHP were found to be the most promising decontamination methods; however, concerns remain about the throughput capabilities for EtO and VHP.\n Further research is needed before any specific decontamination methods can be recommended.\n","id":"PMC2781738","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dennis J.","surname":"Viscusi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael

however, concerns remain about the throughput capabilities for EtO and VHP.\n Further research is needed before any specific decontamination methods can be recommended.\n","id":"PMC2781738","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dennis J.","surname":"Viscusi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael S.","surname":"Bergman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin C.","surname":"Eimer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronald E.","surname":"Shaffer","email":"rshaffer@cdc.gov","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jhin.2020.04.001","date":"2020-04-02","title":"Sterilization of disposable face masks by means of standardized dry and steam sterilization processes;
