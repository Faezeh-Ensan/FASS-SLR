There were 2299 COVID-19 death counts in Wuhan during the study period.\n\n A positive association with COVID-19 daily death counts was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = ?0.32).\n\n In addition, one unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 deaths in lag 3. However, both 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 death in lag 3 and lag 5, with the greatest decrease both in lag 3 [?7.50% (95% CI: ?10.99%,

specific.\n\n However, very few studies have been conducted that assess the effects of temperature on daily mortality in urban areas in Portugal.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this paper time-series analysis was used to model the relationship between mean apparent temperature and daily mortality during the warm season (April to September) in the two largest urban areas in Portugal: Lisbon and Oporto.\n\n We used generalized additive Poisson regression models, adjusted for day of week and season.\n\n\nResults\nOur results show that in Lisbon, a 1°C increase in mean apparent temperature is associated with a 2.1% (95%CI: 1.6, 2.5), 2.4% (95%CI: 1.7, 3.1) and 1.7% (95%CI: 0.1, 3.4) increase in all-causes, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively.\n\n In Oporto the increase was 1.5% (95%CI:

European cities","abstract":"Background\nEurope has experienced warmer summers in the past two decades and there is a need to describe the determinants of heat-related mortality to better inform public health activities during hot weather.\n\n We investigated the effect of high temperatures on daily mortality in three cities in Europe (Budapest, London, and Milan), using a standard approach.\n\n\nMethods\nAn ecological time-series study of daily mortality was conducted in three cities using Poisson generalized linear models allowing for over-dispersion.\n\n Secular trends in mortality and seasonal confounding factors were controlled for using cubic smoothing splines of time.\n\n Heat exposure was modelled using average values of the temperature measure on the same day as death (lag 0) and the day before (lag 1).\n\n The heat effect was quantified assuming a linear increase in risk above a cut-point for each city.\n\n Socio-economic status indicators and census data were linked with mortality data for stratified analyses.\n\n\nResults\nThe risk of heat-related death increased with age, and females had a greater risk than males in age groups ?65 years in London and Milan.\n\n The relative risks of mortality (per °C) above the heat cut-point by gender and age were: (i) Male 1.10 (95%CI: 1.071.12) and Female 1.07 (1.051.10) for 7584 years, (ii) M 1.10 (1.061.14) and F 1.08 (1.061.11) for ?85 years in Budapest (?24°C); (i) M 1.03 (1.011.04) and F 1.07 (1.051.09), (ii) M 1.05 (1.031.07) and F 1.08 (1.071.10) in London (?20°C); and (i) M 1.08 (1.031.14) and F 1.20 (1.151.26), (ii) M 1.18 (1.111.26) and F 1.19 (1.151.24) in Milan (?26°C).\n\n Mortality from external causes increases at higher temperatures as well as that from respiratory and cardiovascular disease.\n\n There was no clear evidence of effect modification by socio-economic status in either Budapest or London, but there was a seemingly higher risk for affluent non-elderly adults in Milan.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe found broadly consistent determinants (age, gender, and cause of death) of heat related mortality in three European cities using a standard approach.\n\n Our results are consistent with previous evidence for individual determinants, and also confirm the lack of a strong socio-economic gradient in heat health effects currently in Europe.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2266730","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ai","surname":"Ishigami","email":"ai.ishigami@lshtm.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shakoor","surname":"Hajat","email":"shakoor.hajat@lshtm.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"R

2008.\nMethods\nPubMed was used to search for the following keywords: temperature, apparent temperature, heat, heat index, and mortality.\n\n The search was limited to the English language and epidemiologic studies.\n\n Studies that reported mortality counts or excess deaths following heat waves were excluded so that the focus remained on general ambient temperature and mortality in a variety of locations.\n\n Studies focusing on cold temperature effects were also excluded.\n\n\nResults\nThirty-six total studies were presented in three tables: 1) elevated ambient temperature and mortality; 2) air pollutants as confounders and/or effect modifiers of the elevated ambient temperature and mortality association; and 3) vulnerable subgroups of the elevated ambient temperature-mortality association.\n\n The evidence suggests that particulate matter with less than 10 um in aerodynamic diameter and ozone may confound the association, while ozone was an effect modifier in the warmer months in some locations.\n\n Nonetheless, the independent effect of temperature and mortality was withheld.\n\n Elevated temperature was associated with increased risk for those dying from cardiovascular, respiratory, cerebrovascular, and some specific cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction.\n\n Vulnerable subgroups also included: Black racial/ethnic group, women, those with lower socioeconomic status, and several age groups, particularly the elderly over 65 years of age as well as infants and young children.\n\n\nConclusion\nMany of these outcomes and vulnerable subgroups have only been identified in recent studies and varied by location and study population.\n\n Thus, region-specific policies, especially in urban areas, are vital to the mitigation of heat-related deaths.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2759912","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rupa","surname":"Basu","email":"rbasu@oehha.ca.gov","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(95)90341-0","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Temperature

Meta-analysis of Epidemiological Evidence","abstract":"Introduction\nClimate change and rapid population ageing are significant public health challenges.\n\n Understanding which health problems are affected by temperature is important for preventing heat and cold-related deaths and illnesses, particularly in the elderly.\n\n Here we present a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of ambient hot and cold temperature (excluding heat/cold wave only studies) on elderly (65 + years) mortality and morbidity.\n\n\nMethods\nTime-series or case-crossover studies comprising cause-specific cases of elderly mortality (n = 3,933,398) or morbidity (n = 12,157,782) were pooled to obtain a percent change (%) in risk for temperature exposure on cause-specific disease outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis.\n\n\nResults\nA 1 °C temperature rise increased cardiovascular (3.44%, 95% CI 3.103.78), respiratory (3.60%, 3.184.02), and cerebrovascular (1.40%, 0.062.75) mortality.\n\n A 1 °C temperature reduction increased respiratory (2.90%, 1.843.97) and cardiovascular (1.66%, 1.192.14) mortality.\n\n The greatest risk was associated with cold-induced pneumonia (6.89%, 2012.99) and respiratory morbidity (4.93% 1.548.44).\n\n A 1 °C temperature rise increased cardiovascular, respiratory, diabetes mellitus, genitourinary, infectious disease and heat-related morbidity.\n\n\nDiscussion\nElevated risks for the elderly were prominent for temperature-induced cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, diabetes, genitourinary, infectious disease, heat-related, and respiratory outcomes.\n\n These risks will likely increase with climate change and global

p = 0.054) for respiratory mortality but not for the other outcomes (p &gt; 0.135).\n In this subtropical city, local air quality objectives should take into account that air pollution has stronger health effects during the cool rather than warm season and that oxidant pollutants are more important indicators of health effects than particulates.\n","id":"PMC1240272","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"C M","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A J","surname":"Hedley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T H","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Air pollution and daily mortality in London: 1987-92","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/01.ede.0000165817.40152.85","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A meta-analysis of time-series studies of ozone and mortality with comparison to the national morbidity, mortality, and air pollution study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/oem.56.4.237","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short-term associations between outdoor air pollution and mortality in London 1992-4","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/01.ede.0000165821.90114.7f","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Associations between ozone and daily mortality: analysis and meta-analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Air pollution and mortality: results from a study of Santiago, Chile","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1164/rccm.200407-933OC","date":"1970-01-01","title":"How sensitive is the association between ozone and daily deaths to control for temperature?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/00001648-199809000-00005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Time-series analysis of air pollution and cause-specific mortality","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Environmental Protection Agency (US).

host, we show that aerosol spread of influenza virus is dependent upon both ambient relative humidity and temperature.\n Twenty experiments performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission.\n The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza epidemiology and evolution.\n","id":"PMC2034399","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anice

region.\n\n In addition, the effect of diurnal temperature range on influenza incidence is unclear, according to previous study findings.\n\n\nObjectives\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the effects of temperature, humidity, and diurnal temperature range on the incidence of influenza in Seoul, Republic of Korea, which is located in a temperate region.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used Korean National Health insurance data to assess the weekly influenza incidence between 2010 and 2016, and used meteorological data from Seoul.\n\n To investigate the effect of temperature, relative humidity, and diurnal temperature range levels on influenza incidence, we used a distributed lag non?linear model.\n\n\nResults\nThe risk of influenza incidence was significantly increased with low daily temperatures of 0?5°C and low (30%40%) or high (70%) relative humidity.\n\n We found a positive significant association between diurnal temperature range and influenza incidence in this study.\n\n\nConclusions\nInfluenza incidence increased with low temperature and low/high humidity in a temperate region.\n\n Influenza incidence also increased with high diurnal temperature range, after considering temperature and humidity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6928031","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ji?Eun","surname":"Park","email":"jepark@kiom.re.kr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Woo?Sik","surname":"Son","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Woo?Sik","surname":"Son","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeonhee","surname":"Ryu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Soo

Three methodologies were used to evaluate the isolated association: time-series analysis using Poisson regression model, bidirectional case-crossover analysis matched by period, and case-crossover analysis matched by the confounding factor, i.\n\ne.\n\n, average temperature or pollutant concentration.\n\n The graphical representation of the response surface, generated by the interaction term between these factors added to the Poisson regression model, was interpreted to evaluate the synergistic effect of the risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo differences were observed between the results of the case-crossover and time-series analyses.\n\n The percentage change in the relative risk of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was 0.85% (0.45;1.25) and 1.60% (0.74;2.46), respectively, due to an increase of 10 ?g/m3 in the PM10 concentration.\n\n The pattern of correlation of the temperature with cardiovascular mortality was U-shaped and that with respiratory mortality was J-shaped, indicating an increased relative risk at high temperatures.\n\n The values for the interaction term indicated a higher relative risk for cardiovascular and respiratory mortalities at low temperatures and high temperatures, respectively, when the pollution levels reached approximately 60 ?g/m3.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe positive association standardized in the Poisson regression model for pollutant concentration is not confounded by temperature, and the effect of temperature is not confounded by the pollutant levels in the time-series analysis.\n\n The simultaneous exposure to different levels of environmental factors can create synergistic effects that are as disturbing as those caused by extreme concentrations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4285836","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Samya de Lara Lins de

UK media framing of the 2003 SARS epidemic","abstract":"Since the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, social scientists and sociologists of health and illness have been exploring the metaphorical framing of this infectious disease in its social context.\n Many have focused on the militaristic language used to report and explain this illness, a type of language that has permeated discourses of immunology, bacteriology and infection for at least a century.\n In this article, we examine how language and metaphor were used in the UK media's coverage of another previously unknown and severe infectious disease: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n SARS offers an opportunity to explore the cultural framing of a less extraordinary epidemic disease.\n It therefore provides an analytical counter-weight to the very extensive body of interpretation that has developed around HIV/AIDS.\n By analysing the total reporting on SARS of five major national newspapers during the epidemic of spring 2003, we investigate how the reporting of SARS in the UK press was framed, and how this related to media, public and governmental responses to the disease.\n We found that, surprisingly, militaristic language was largely absent, as was the judgemental discourse of plague.\n Rather, the main conceptual metaphor used was SARS as a killer.\n SARS as a killer was a single unified entity, not an army or force.\n We provide some tentative explanations for this shift in linguistic framing by relating it to local political concerns, media cultures, and spatial factors.\n","id":"PMC7117051","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Wallis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Brigitte","surname":"Nerlich","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to

cities to examine temperature-mortality relationships and optimum temperature of China.\n A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to analyze the acute-effect of temperature on non-accidental mortality, and meta-analysis was used to merge data.\n Furthermore, the lagged effects of temperature up to 40 days on mortality and optimum temperature were analyzed using the distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM).\n We found that for all non-accidental mortality, high temperature could significantly increase the excess risk (ER) of death by 0.33% (95% confidence interval: 0.11%, 0.56%) with the temperature increase of 1 °C.\n Similar but non-significant ER of death was observed when temperature decreased.\n The lagged effect of temperature showed that the relative risk of

daily mortality.\n\n\nObjectives\nWe set out to identify subpopulations and mortality causes with increased susceptibility to temperature extremes.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a case-only analysis using daily mortality and hourly weather data from 50 U.\n\nS.\n\n cities for the period 19892000, covering a total of 7,789,655 deaths.\n\n We used distributions of daily minimum and maximum temperature in each city to define extremely hot days (? 99th percentile) and extremely cold days (? 1st percentile), respectively.\n\n For each (hypothesized) effect modifier, a city-specific logistic regression model was fitted and an overall estimate calculated in a subsequent meta-analysis.\n\n\nResults\nOlder subjects [odds ratio (OR) = 1.020; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0051.034], diabetics (OR = 1.035; 95% CI, 1.0101.062), blacks (OR = 1.037; 95% CI, 1.0161.059), and those dying outside a hospital (OR = 1.066; 95% CI, 1.0361.098) were more susceptible to extreme heat, with some differences observed between those dying from a cardiovascular disease and other decedents.\n\n Cardiovascular deaths (OR = 1.053; 95% CI, 1.0361.070), and especially cardiac arrest deaths (OR =1.137; 95% CI, 1.0511.230), showed a greater relative increase on extremely cold days, whereas the increase in heat-related mortality was marginally higher for those with coexisting atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.059; 95% CI, 0.9961.125).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study we identified several subpopulations and mortality causes particularly susceptible to temperature

develop the family of distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM), a modelling framework that can simultaneously represent non-linear exposureresponse dependencies and delayed effects.\n This methodology is based on the definition of a cross-basis, a bi-dimensional space of functions that describes simultaneously the shape of the relationship along both the space of the predictor and the lag dimension of its occurrence.\n In this way the approach provides a unified framework for a range of models that have previously been used in this setting, and new more flexible variants.\n This family of models is implemented in the package dlnm within the statistical environment R.\n To illustrate the methodology we use examples of DLNMs to represent the relationship between temperature and

present an analysis of medium-term (weeks to months) exposure effects of particulate pollution and temperature.\n We assessed the associations of particulate pollution (black smoke) and temperature with age-standardized daily mortality rates over 17 years in Dublin, Ireland, using a polynomial distributed lag model of both temperature and particulate air pollution simultaneously through 40 days after exposure.\n When only acute effects (3-day mean) were considered, we found total mortality increased by 0.4% for each 10-microg/m3 increase in black smoke concentration.\n When deaths in the 40 days after exposure were considered, we found a 1.1% increase.\n For respiratory mortality, the estimated effect was 0.9% for acute exposures, but 3.6% for the extended follow-up.\n We found each increase in current-day temperature by 1 degree C was associated with a 0.4% increase in total mortality, whereas each decrease of 1 degree C was associated with a 2.6% increase in mortality in the following 40 days.\n For both temperature and pollution, the largest effects on cardiovascular mortality were observed immediately, whereas respiratory mortality was delayed and distributed over several weeks.\n These effects were two to three times greater than the acute effects reported in other studies, and approach the effects reported in longer-term survival studies.\n This analysis

metrics and models are used in different jurisdictions, generally without systematic comparisons of alternatives.\n\n We report such an analysis for New York City that compared maximum heat index with alternative metrics in models to predict daily variation in warm-season natural-cause mortality from 1997 through 2006.\nMaterials and methods\nWe used Poisson time-series generalized linear models and generalized additive models to estimate weathermortality relationships using various metrics, lag and averaging times, and functional forms and compared model fit.\n\n\nResults\nA model that included cubic functions of maximum heat index on the same and each of the previous 3 days provided the best fit, better than models using maximum, minimum, or average temperature, or spatial synoptic classification (SSC) of weather type.\n\n We found that goodness of fit and maximum heat indexmortality functions were similar using parametric and nonparametric models.\n\n Same-day maximum heat index was linearly related to mortality risk across its range.\n\n The slopes at lags of 1, 2, and 3 days were flat across moderate values but increased sharply between maximum heat index of 95°F and 100°F (3538°C).\n\n SSC or other meteorologic variables added to the maximum heat index model moderately improved goodness of fit, with slightly attenuated maximum heat indexmortality

relationship supports issuing heat alerts in New York City when the heat index is forecast to exceed approximately 95100°F.\n\n Periodic city-specific analyses using recent data are recommended to

have been documented in developed countries, including North America and Europe.\n\n However, far fewer research reports are available from developing countries or specific cities in South Asia.\n\n In May 2010, Ahmedabad, India, faced a heat wave where the temperatures reached a high of 46.8°C with an apparent increase in mortality.\n\n The purpose of this study is to characterize the heat wave impact and assess the associated excess mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an analysis of all-cause mortality associated with a May 2010 heat wave in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, to determine whether extreme heat leads to excess mortality.\n\n Counts of all-cause deaths from May 131, 2010 were compared with the mean of counts from temporally matched periods in May 2009 and 2011 to calculate excess mortality.\n\n Other analyses included a 7-day moving average, mortality rate ratio analysis, and relationship between daily maximum temperature and daily all-cause death counts over the entire year of 2010, using month-wise correlations.\n\n\nResults\nThe May 2010 heat wave was associated with significant excess all-cause mortality.\n\n 4,462 all-cause deaths occurred, comprising an excess of 1,344 all-cause deaths, an estimated 43.1% increase when compared to the reference period (3,118 deaths).\n\n In monthly pair-wise comparisons for 2010, we found high correlations between mortality and daily maximum temperature during the locally hottest summer months of April (r?=?0.69, p&lt;0.001), May (r?=?0.77, p&lt;0.001), and June (r?=?0.39, p&lt;0.05).\n\n During a period of more

and compare the impact on mortality by gender, age and death causes in Europe during summers 1990-2004 and 2003, separately, accounting for heat wave duration and intensity.\n\n\nMethods\nHeat waves were defined considering both maximum apparent temperature and minimum temperature and classified by intensity, duration and timing during summer.\n\n The effect was estimated as percent increase in daily mortality during heat wave days compared to non heat wave days in people over 65 years.\n\n City specific and pooled estimates by gender, age and cause of death were calculated.\n\n\nResults\nThe effect of heat waves showed great geographical heterogeneity among cities.\n\n Considering all years, except 2003, the increase in mortality during heat wave days ranged from + 7.6% in Munich to + 33.6% in Milan.\n\n The increase was up to 3-times greater during episodes of long duration and high intensity.\n\n Pooled results showed a greater impact in Mediterranean (+ 21.8% for total mortality) than in North Continental (+ 12.4%) cities.\n\n The highest effect was observed for respiratory diseases and among women aged 75-84 years.\n\n In 2003 the highest impact was observed in cities where heat wave episode was characterized by unusual meteorological conditions.\n\n\nConclusions\nClimate change scenarios indicate that extreme events are expected to increase

syndrome (SARS) and meteorological factors and air pollution.\n\n\nStudy design\nAn ecological study was conducted.\n\n\nMethods\nThree hundred and fifty primary probable SARS cases diagnosed in mainland China between 1 January and 31 May 2003, and their 6727 close contacts during the period of their clinical symptoms before admission, were included in this study.\n\n Of the 6727 close contacts, 135 (2.0%) later developed clinical symptoms and were diagnosed as probable SARS cases.\n\n The daily meteorological data and daily air pollution data during the same SARS outbreak period in mainland China were used in the data analysis.\n\n Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the association between the secondary attack rate of SARS and meteorological factors and air pollution.\n\n\nResults\nIn univariate analyses, daily average temperature (DAT), daily average air pressure (DAAP), and daily average relative humidity (DARH) were inversely associated with secondary attack rate (P&lt;0.001); a significant positive association was found for daily hours of sunshine (DHS) (P&lt;0.001).\n\n In multivariate analyses, factors associated with secondary attack rate were DAAP (odds ratio (OR)=0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42, 0.66), DARH (OR=0.73, 95% CI: 0.53, 1.00), and daily average wind velocity (DAWV; OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.96).\n\n Adjustment for the onset time of a primary case led to little change in the results.\n\n In addition, in Hebei Province, a major affected area in China, only DAWV (OR=0.38, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.72) was a significant predictor of secondary attack rate with adjustment for the onset time of primary case.\n\n In Inner Mongolia, another major affected area in China, DAWV (OR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.94) and DHS (OR=0.27, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.81) were significant predictors of secondary attack rate with adjustment for the onset time of primary case.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results suggest that the SARS outbreak was significantly associated with DAWV, and that DAAP, DARH and DHS may also have influenced the SARS outbreak to some extent.\n\n However, because of ecological fallacy and uncontrolled confounding effects that may have biased the results, the association between the SARS outbreak and these meteorological factors and air pollution deserve further investigation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7118752","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Quan-Cai","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qin-Feng","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qiang","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"De-Zhong","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing-Wen","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gen-Ming","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing-Wu","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References

respiratory syndrome (SARS) has claimed 349 lives with 5,327 probable cases reported in mainland China since November 2002. SARS case fatality has varied across geographical areas, which might be partially explained by air pollution level.\n\n\nMethods\nPublicly accessible data on SARS morbidity and mortality were utilized in the data analysis.\n\n Air pollution was evaluated by air pollution index (API) derived from the concentrations of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ground-level ozone.\n\n Ecologic analysis was conducted to explore the association and correlation between air pollution and SARS case fatality via model fitting.\n\n Partially ecologic studies were performed to assess the effects of long-term and short-term exposures on the risk of dying from SARS.\n\n\nResults\nEcologic analysis conducted among 5 regions with 100 or more SARS cases showed that case fatality rate increased with the increment of API (case fatality = - 0.063 + 0.001 * API).\n\n Partially ecologic study based on short-term exposure demonstrated that SARS patients from regions with moderate APIs had an 84% increased risk of dying from SARS compared to those from regions with low APIs (RR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.412.40).\n\n Similarly, SARS patients from regions with high APIs were twice as likely to die from SARS compared to those from regions with low APIs.\n\n (RR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.313.65).\n\n Partially ecologic analysis based on long-term exposure to ambient air pollution showed the similar association.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur studies demonstrated a positive association between air pollution and SARS case fatality in Chinese population by utilizing publicly accessible data on SARS statistics and air pollution indices.\n\n Although ecologic fallacy and uncontrolled confounding effect might have biased the results, the possibility of a detrimental effect of air pollution on the prognosis of SARS patients deserves further investigation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC293432","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Cui","email":"yancui@ucla.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zuo-Feng","surname":"Zhang","email":"zfzhang@ucla.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Froines","email":"jfroines@ucla.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jinkou","surname":"Zhao","email":"jkzhao@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Wang","email":"jkzhao@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shun-Zhang","surname":"Yu","email":"szyu@shmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roger","surname":"Detels","email":"detels@ucla.edu","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cumulative Number of Reported Probable Cases of SARS (From: Nov 1st, 2002 To: August 7th, 2003) World Health Organization, Communicable Disease Surveillance &amp; Response (CSR)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nationwide SARS statistics in China.

relationship remain unclear.\n There is no consistent explanation for influenzas transmission patterns that applies to both temperate and tropical regions.\n This study aimed to determine the relationship between ambient humidity and viability of the influenza A virus (IAV) during transmission between hosts and to explain the mechanisms underlying it.\n We measured the viability of IAV in droplets consisting of various model media, chosen to isolate effects of salts and proteins found in respiratory fluid, and in human mucus, at relative humidities (RH) ranging from 17% to 100%.\n In all media and mucus, viability was highest when RH was either close to 100% or below ?50%.\n When RH decreased from 84% to 50%, the relationship between viability and RH depended on droplet composition: viability decreased in saline solutions, did not change significantly in solutions supplemented with proteins, and increased dramatically in mucus.\n Additionally, viral decay increased linearly with salt concentration in saline solutions but not when they were supplemented with proteins.\n There appear to be three regimes of IAV viability in droplets, defined by humidity: physiological conditions (?100% RH) with high viability, concentrated conditions (50% to near 100% RH) with lower viability depending on the composition of media, and dry conditions (&lt;50% RH) with high viability.\n This paradigm could help resolve conflicting findings in the literature on the relationship between IAV viability in aerosols and humidity, and results in human mucus could help explain influenzas seasonality in different

influenza virus survival in grade schools","abstract":"Background\nLow absolute humidity (AH) has been associated with increased influenza virus survival and transmissibility and the onset of seasonal influenza outbreaks.\n\n Humidification of indoor environments may mitigate viral transmission and may be an important control strategy, particularly in schools where viral transmission is common and contributes to the spread of influenza in communities.\n\n However, the variability and predictors of AH in the indoor school environment and the feasibility of classroom humidification to levels that could decrease viral survival have not been studied.\n\n\nMethods\nAutomated sensors were used to measure temperature, humidity and CO2 levels in two Minnesota grade schools without central humidification during two successive winters.\n\n Outdoor AH measurements were derived from the North American Land Data Assimilation System.\n\n Variability in indoor AH within classrooms, between classrooms in the same school, and between schools was assessed using concordance correlation coefficients (CCC).\n\n Predictors of indoor AH were examined using time-series Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models.\n\n Classroom humidifiers were used when school was not in session to assess the feasibility of increasing indoor AH to levels associated with decreased influenza virus survival, as projected from previously published animal experiments.\n\n\nResults\nAH varied little within classrooms (CCC &gt;0.90) but was more variable between classrooms in the same school (CCC 0.81 for School 1, 0.88 for School 2) and between schools (CCC 0.81).\n\n Indoor AH varied widely during the winter (range 2.60 to 10.34 millibars [mb]) and was strongly associated with changes in outdoor AH (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Changes in indoor AH on school weekdays were strongly associated with CO2 levels (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Over 4 hours, classroom humidifiers increased indoor AH by 4 mb, an increase sufficient to decrease projected 1-hour virus survival by an absolute value of 30% during winter months.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring winter, indoor AH in non-humidified grade schools varies substantially and often to levels that are very low.\n\n Indoor results are predicted by outdoor AH over a season and CO2 levels (which likely reflects human activity) during individual school days.\n\n Classroom humidification may be a feasible approach to increase indoor AH to levels that may decrease influenza virus survival and

survey in Belgium with local weather data.\n In the absence of a previous in-depth weather impact analysis of social contact patterns, we explored the possibilities and identified pitfalls.\n We found general dominance of day-type (weekend, holiday, working day) over weather conditions, but nonetheless observed an increase in long duration contacts (1 hour) on regular workdays with low temperatures, almost no precipitation and low absolute humidity of the air.\n Interestingly, these conditions are often assumed to be beneficial for virus survival and transmission.\n Further research is needed to establish the impact of the weather on social contacts.\n We recommend that future studies sample over a broad spectrum of weather conditions and day types and include a sufficiently

Three methodologies were used to evaluate the isolated association: time-series analysis using Poisson regression model, bidirectional case-crossover analysis matched by period, and case-crossover analysis matched by the confounding factor, i.\n\ne.\n\n, average temperature or pollutant concentration.\n\n The graphical representation of the response surface, generated by the interaction term between these factors added to the Poisson regression model, was interpreted to evaluate the synergistic effect of the risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo differences were observed between the results of the case-crossover and time-series analyses.\n\n The percentage change in the relative risk of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was 0.85% (0.45;1.25) and 1.60% (0.74;2.46), respectively, due to an increase of 10 ?g/m3 in the PM10 concentration.\n\n The pattern of correlation of the temperature with cardiovascular mortality was U-shaped and that with respiratory mortality was J-shaped, indicating an increased relative risk at high temperatures.\n\n The values for the interaction term indicated a higher relative risk for cardiovascular and respiratory mortalities at low temperatures and high temperatures, respectively, when the pollution levels reached approximately 60 ?g/m3.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe positive association standardized in the Poisson regression model for pollutant concentration is not confounded by temperature, and the effect of temperature is not confounded by the pollutant levels in the time-series analysis.\n\n The simultaneous exposure to different levels of environmental factors can create synergistic effects that are as disturbing as those caused by extreme concentrations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4285836","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Samya de Lara Lins de

2003 SARS epidemic","abstract":"Since the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, social scientists and sociologists of health and illness have been exploring the metaphorical framing of this infectious disease in its social context.\n Many have focused on the militaristic language used to report and explain this illness, a type of language that has permeated discourses of immunology, bacteriology and infection for at least a century.\n In this article, we examine how language and metaphor were used in the UK media's coverage of another previously unknown and severe infectious disease: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n SARS offers an opportunity to explore the cultural framing of a less extraordinary epidemic disease.\n It therefore provides an analytical counter-weight to the very extensive body of interpretation that has developed around HIV/AIDS.\n By analysing the total reporting on SARS of five major national newspapers during the epidemic of spring 2003, we investigate how the reporting of SARS in the UK press was framed, and how this related to media, public and governmental responses to the disease.\n We found that, surprisingly, militaristic language was largely absent, as was the judgemental discourse of plague.\n Rather, the main conceptual metaphor used was SARS as a killer.\n SARS as a killer was a single unified entity, not an army or force.\n We provide some tentative explanations for this shift in linguistic framing by relating it to local political concerns, media cultures, and spatial factors.\n","id":"PMC7117051","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Wallis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Brigitte","surname":"Nerlich","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.","id":"PMC7164482","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stephen M.","surname":"Kissler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Tedijanto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Tedijanto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward","surname":"Goldstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward","surname":"Goldstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yonatan H.","surname":"Grad","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yonatan H.","surname":"Grad","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Lipsitch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Lipsitch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid2609.202267","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effect of Environmental Conditions on SARS-CoV-2 Stability in Human Nasal Mucus and Sputum","abstract":"We found that environmental conditions affect the stability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in nasal mucus and sputum.\n The virus is more stable at low-temperature and low-humidity conditions, whereas warmer temperature and higher humidity shortened half-life.\n Although infectious virus was undetectable after 48 hours, viral RNA remained detectable for 7 days.\n","id":"PMC7454058","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"M.

2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

spreading across the world.\n\n As of March 26, 2020, there are more than 500,000 cases and more than 25,000 deaths related to COVID-19, and the numbers are increasing by the hour.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to explore the trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases in North Carolina, and to understand patterns in virtual visits related to symptoms of COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe conducted a cohort study of confirmed COVID-19 cases and patients using an on-demand, statewide virtual urgent care center.\n\n We collected data from February 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020. Institutional Review Board exemption was obtained prior to the study.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March, 18 2020, there were 92 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 733 total virtual visits.\n\n Of the total visits, 257 (35.1%) were related to COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n Of the COVID-19-like visits, the number of females was 178 (69.2%).\n\n People in the age groups of 30-39 years (n=67, 26.1%) and 40-49 years (n=64, 24.9%) were half of the total patients.\n\n Additionally, approximately 96.9% (n=249) of the COVID-like encounters came from within the state of North Carolina.\n\n Our study shows that virtual care can provide efficient triaging in the counties with the highest number of COVID-19 cases.\n\n We also confirmed that the largest spread of the disease occurs in areas with a high population density as well as in areas with major airports.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe use of virtual care presents promising potential in the fight against COVID-19. Virtual care is capable of reducing emergency room visits, conserving health care resources, and avoiding the spread of COVID-19 by treating patients remotely.\n\n We call for further adoption of virtual care by health systems across the United States and the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7162649","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yousef","surname":"Khader","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Travis","surname":"Sanchez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Danielle","surname":"McCarthy","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Danielle","surname":"McCarthy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pablo","surname":"Valente","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saif","surname":"Khairat","email":"saif@unc.edu","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Saif","surname":"Khairat","email":"saif@unc.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chenlu","surname":"Meng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chenlu","surname":"Meng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuxuan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yuxuan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Barbara","surname":"Edson","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Barbara","surname":"Edson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Gianforcaro","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Gianforcaro","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMe2002387","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Covid-19  Navigating the Uncharted","abstract":"","id":"PMC7121221","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anthony S.","surname":"Fauci","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"H.

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, outside Hubei provincethe epicentre of the outbreakhad been reported.\n\n Since late January, massive public health interventions have been implemented nationwide to contain the outbreak.\n\n We provide an impact assessment of the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 during the first wave in mainland Chinese locations outside Hubei.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, and the ten Chinese provinces that had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; and the confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou, and all 31 Chinese provinces.\n\n We used a susceptibleinfectiousrecovered model to show the potential effects of relaxing containment measures after the first wave of infection, in anticipation of a possible second wave.\n\n\nFindings\nIn all selected cities and provinces, the Rt decreased substantially since Jan 23, when control measures were implemented, and have since remained below 1. The cCFR outside Hubei was 0·98% (95% CI 0·821·16), which was almost five times lower than that in Hubei (5·91%, 5·736·09).\n\n Relaxing the interventions (resulting in Rt &gt;1) when the epidemic size was still small would increase the cumulative case count exponentially as a function of relaxation duration, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push disease prevalence back to the baseline level.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe first wave of COVID-19 outside of Hubei has abated because of aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\n However, given the substantial risk of viral reintroduction, particularly from overseas importation, close monitoring of Rt and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave to achieve an optimal balance between health and economic protection.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund, Hong Kong,

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·154·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·412·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Adam J","surname":"Kucharski","email":"adam.kucharski@lshtm.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy W","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charlie","surname":"Diamond","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Edmunds","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosalind M","surname":"Eggo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fiona","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Jit","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James D","surname":"Munday","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas","surname":"Davies","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Gimma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"van Zandvoort","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamish","surname":"Gibbs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joel","surname":"Hellewell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher I","surname":"Jarvis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Clifford","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Billy J","surname":"Quilty","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nikos I","surname":"Bosse","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Abbott","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Petra","surname":"Klepac","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Flasche","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41591-020-0822-7","date":"2020-03-09","title":"Estimating clinical severity of COVID-19 from the transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China","abstract":"id='Par2'>As of 29 February 2020 there were 79,394 confirmed cases and 2,838 deaths from COVID-19 in mainland China.\n Of these, 48,557 cases and 2,169 deaths occurred in the epicenter, Wuhan.\n A key public health priority during the emergence of a novel pathogen is estimating clinical severity, which requires properly adjusting for the case ascertainment rate and the delay between symptoms onset and death.\n Using public and published information, we estimate that the overall symptomatic case fatality risk (the probability of dying after developing symptoms) of COVID-19 in Wuhan was 1.4% (0.92.1%), which is substantially lower than both the corresponding crude or naïve confirmed case fatality risk (2,169/48,557?=?4.5%) and the approximator1 of deaths/deaths?+?recoveries (2,169/2,169?+?17,572?=?11%) as of 29 February 2020.

host, we show that aerosol spread of influenza virus is dependent upon both ambient relative humidity and temperature.\n Twenty experiments performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission.\n The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza epidemiology and

disease in its social context.\n Many have focused on the militaristic language used to report and explain this illness, a type of language that has permeated discourses of immunology, bacteriology and infection for at least a century.\n In this article, we examine how language and metaphor were used in the UK media's coverage of another previously unknown and severe infectious disease: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n SARS offers an opportunity to explore the cultural framing of a less extraordinary epidemic disease.\n It therefore provides an analytical counter-weight to the very extensive body of interpretation that has developed around HIV/AIDS.\n By analysing the total reporting on SARS of five major national newspapers during the epidemic of spring 2003, we investigate how the reporting of SARS in the UK press was framed, and how this related to media, public and governmental responses to the disease.\n We found that, surprisingly, militaristic language was largely absent, as was the judgemental discourse of plague.\n Rather, the main conceptual metaphor used was SARS as a killer.\n SARS as a killer was a single unified entity, not an army or force.\n We provide some tentative explanations for this shift in linguistic framing by relating it to local political concerns, media cultures, and spatial

under various definitions on non-accidental mortality in hot season (MaySeptember) in Wuhan, China during 20032010.\nResults\nid='Par3'>Heat waves defined by HW14 (daily mean temperature???99.0th percentile and duration???3 days) had the best predictive ability in assessing the mortality effects of heat wave with the relative risk of 1.63 (95% CI: 1.43, 1.89) for total mortality.\n\n The group-specific mortality risk using official heat wave definition of Chinese Meteorological Administration was much smaller than that using HW14. We also found that women, and the elderly (age???65) were more susceptible to heat wave effects which were stronger and longer lasting.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>These findings suggest that region specific heat wave definitions are crucial and necessary for developing efficient local heat warning systems and for providing evidence for policy makers to protect the vulnerable population.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s41256-017-0030-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5683448","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yunquan","surname":"Zhang","email":"Yun-quanZhang@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Renjie","surname":"Feng","email":"2014203050012@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ran","surname":"Wu","email":"wuran@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peirong","surname":"Zhong","email":"zhongpr_1993@126.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaodong","surname":"Tan","email":"xiaodongtan@yahoo.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kai","surname":"Wu","email":"uueng@hotmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Ma","email":"malu@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1007327","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The calendar of epidemics: Seasonal cycles of infectious diseases","abstract":"","id":"PMC6224126","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Micaela Elvira","surname":"Martinez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kimberly A.","surname":"Kline","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Kimberly A.","surname":"Kline","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kimberly A.","surname":"Kline","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Interpretation of Periodicity in Disease Prevalence","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0001296","date":"2007-10-19","title":"Global Patterns in Seasonal Activity of Influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1, and B from 1997 to 2005: Viral Coexistence and Latitudinal Gradients","abstract":"Despite a mass of research on the epidemiology of seasonal influenza, overall patterns of infection have not been fully described on broad geographic scales and for specific types and subtypes of the influenza virus.\n Here we provide a descriptive analysis of laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance data by type and subtype (A/H3N2, A/H1N1, and B) for 19 temperate countries in the Northern and Southern hemispheres from 1997 to 2005, compiled from a public database maintained by WHO (FluNet).\n Key findings include patterns of large scale co-occurrence of influenza type A and B, interhemispheric synchrony for subtype A/H3N2, and latitudinal gradients in epidemic timing for type A.\n These findings highlight the need for more countries to conduct year-round viral surveillance and report reliable incidence data at the type and subtype level, especially in the Tropics.\n","id":"PMC2117904","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Brian S.","surname":"Finkelman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cécile","surname":"Viboud","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Katia","surname":"Koelle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthew J.","surname":"Ferrari","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nita","surname":"Bharti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bryan T.","surname":"Grenfell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Landon","surname":"Myer","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Landon","surname":"Myer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pbio.1000316","date":"2010-01-20","title":"Absolute Humidity and the Seasonal Onset of Influenza in the Continental United States","abstract":"Here, the authors demonstrate that variations of absolute humidity explain both the onset of wintertime influenza transmission and the overarching seasonality of this pathogen in temperate regions.\n","id":"PMC2826374","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jeffrey","surname":"Shaman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Virginia E.","surname":"Pitzer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cécile","surname":"Viboud","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bryan T.","surname":"Grenfell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Lipsitch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neil M.","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neil M.","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Recurrent Outbreaks of Measles, Chickenpox and Mumps: I.

Publication of these data will allow for quantification of the effect of proximity to one or more such plant on cancer and all-cause mortality observed in nearby towns.\n\n However, as errors have been detected in the geocoding of many of the pollutant foci shown in the EPER, it was decided that a validation study should be conducted into the accuracy of these co-ordinates.\n\n EPER-Spain geographic co-ordinates were drawn from the European Environment Agency (EEA) server and the Spanish Ministry of the Environment (MOE).\n\n The Farm Plot Geographic Information System (Sistema de Información Geográfica de Parcelas Agrícolas) (SIGPAC) enables orthophotos (digitalized aerial images) of any territorial point across Spain to be obtained.\n\n Through a search of co-ordinates in the SIGPAC, all the industrial foci (except farms) were located.\n\n The quality criteria used to ascertain possible errors in industrial location were high, medium and low quality, where industries were situated at a distance of less than 500 metres, more than 500 metres but less than 1 kilometre, and more than 1 kilometre from their real locations, respectively.\n\n\nResults\nInsofar as initial registry quality was concerned, 84% of industrial complexes were inaccurately positioned (low quality) according to EEA data versus 60% for Spanish MOE data.\n\n The distribution of the distances between the original and corrected co-ordinates for each of the industries on the registry revealed that the median error was 2.55 kilometres for Spain overall (according to EEA data).\n\n The Autonomous Regions that displayed most errors in industrial geocoding were Murcia, Canary Islands, Andalusia and Madrid.\n\n Correct co-ordinates were successfully allocated to 100% of EPER-Spain industries.\n\n\nConclusion\nKnowing the exact location of pollutant foci is vital to obtain reliable and valid conclusions in any study where distance to the focus is a decisive factor, as in the case of the consequences of industrial pollution on the health of neighbouring

unicellular eukaryotic parasite transmitted by pool blood-feeding sand flies mainly to wild rodents, such as Psammomys obesus.\n\n The human beings who share the rodent and sand fly habitats can be subverted as both sand fly blood resource.\n\n ZCL is endemic in the Middle East, Central Asia, Subsaharan and North Africa.\n\n Like other vector-borne diseases, the incidence of ZCL displayed by humans varies with environmental and climate factors.\n\n However, so far no study has addressed the temporal dynamics or the impact of climate factors on the ZCL risk.\n\n\nPrincipal Findings\nSeasonality during the same epidemiologic year and interval between ZCL epidemics ranging from 4 to 7 years were demonstrated.\n\n Models showed that ZCL incidence is raising i) by 1.8% (95% confidence intervals CI:0.03.6%) when there is 1 mm increase in the rainfall lagged by 12 to 14 months ii) by 5.0% (95% CI: 0.89.4%) when there is a 1% increase in humidity from July to September in the same epidemiologic year.\n\n\nConclusion/Significance\nHigher rainfall is expected to result in increased density of chenopods, a halophytic plant that constitutes the exclusive food of Psammomys obesus.\n\n Consequently, following a high density of Psammomys obesus, the pool of Leishmania major transmissible from the rodents to blood-feeding female sand flies could lead to a higher probability of transmission to humans over the next season.\n\n These findings provide the evidence that ZCL is highly influenced by climate factors that could affect both Psammomys obesus and the sand fly population densities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3341328","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Amine","surname":"Toumi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sadok","surname":"Chlif","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jihene","surname":"Bettaieb","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nissaf

locally appropriate targeting of interventions to those most at risk.\n\n We have, therefore, undertaken a pooled analysis of existing data from multiple sites to enable a comprehensive overview of the age-patterns of malaria outcomes under different epidemiological conditions in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nA systematic review using PubMed and CAB Abstracts (19802005), contacts with experts and searching bibliographies identified epidemiological studies with data on the age distribution of children with P.\n\n falciparum clinical malaria, hospital admissions with malaria and malaria-diagnosed mortality.\n\n Studies were allocated to a 3×2 matrix of intensity and seasonality of malaria transmission.\n\n Maximum likelihood methods were used to fit five continuous probability distributions to the percentage of each outcome by age for each of the six transmission scenarios.\n\n The best-fitting distributions are presented graphically, together with the estimated median age for each outcome.\n\n Clinical malaria incidence was relatively evenly distributed across the first 10 years of life for all transmission scenarios.\n\n Hospital admissions with malaria were more concentrated in younger children, with this effect being even more pronounced for malaria-diagnosed deaths.\n\n For all outcomes, the burden of malaria shifted towards younger ages with increasing transmission intensity, although marked seasonality moderated this effect.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe most severe consequences of P.\n\n falciparum malaria were concentrated in the youngest age groups across all settings.\n\n Despite recently observed declines in malaria transmission in several countries, which will shift the burden of malaria cases towards older children, it is still appropriate to target strategies for preventing malaria mortality and severe morbidity at very young children who will continue to bear the brunt of malaria deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2813874","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ilona","surname":"Carneiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Arantxa","surname":"Roca-Feltrer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jamie

More than 40,000 R.\n aegyptiacus were found in the cave and were the sole bat species present.\n Between August 2008 and November 2009, 1,622 bats were captured and tested for Marburg virus.\n Q-RT-PCR analysis of bat liver/spleen tissues indicated ?2.5% of the bats were actively infected, seven of which yielded Marburg virus isolates.\n Moreover, Q-RT-PCR-positive lung, kidney, colon and reproductive tissues were found, consistent with potential for oral, urine, fecal or sexual transmission.\n The combined data for R.\n aegyptiacus tested from Python Cave and Kitaka mine indicate low level horizontal transmission throughout the year.\n However, Q-RT-PCR data show distinct pulses of virus infection in older juvenile bats (?six months of age) that temporarily coincide with the peak twice-yearly birthing seasons.\n Retrospective analysis of historical human infections suspected to have been the result of discrete spillover events directly from nature found 83% (54/65) events occurred during these seasonal pulses in virus circulation, perhaps demonstrating periods of increased risk of human infection.\n The discovery of two tags at Python Cave from bats marked at Kitaka mine, together with the close genetic linkages evident between viruses detected in geographically distant locations, are consistent with R.\n aegyptiacus bats existing as a large meta-population with associated virus circulation over broad geographic ranges.\n These findings provide a basis for developing Marburg hemorrhagic fever risk reduction strategies.\n","id":"PMC3464226","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Brian R.","surname":"Amman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Serena A.","surname":"Carroll","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zachary D.","surname":"Reed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tara K.","surname":"Sealy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Balinandi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Swanepoel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Kemp","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bobbie Rae","surname":"Erickson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James A.","surname":"Comer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shelley","surname":"Campbell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Deborah L.","surname":"Cannon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marina L.","surname":"Khristova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Atimnedi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher D.","surname":"Paddock","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rebekah J.","surname":"Kent Crockett","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Timothy D.","surname":"Flietstra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kelly L.","surname":"Warfield","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Unfer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edward","surname":"Katongole-Mbidde","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Downing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jordan W.","surname":"Tappero","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sherif R.","surname":"Zaki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierre E.","surname":"Rollin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas G.","surname":"Ksiazek","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stuart T.","surname":"Nichol","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan S.","surname":"Towner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yoshihiro","surname":"Kawaoka","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yoshihiro","surname":"Kawaoka","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1098/rspb.2006.0030","date":"2007-01-23","title":"Seasonality and the persistence and invasion of measles","abstract":"The critical community size (CCS) for measles, which separates persistent from extinction-prone populations, is arguably the best understood stochastic threshold in ecology.\n Using simple models, we explore a relatively neglected relationship of how the CCS scales with birth rate.\n A predominantly positive relationship of persistence with birth rate is complicated by the accompanying dynamical transitions of the underlying deterministic process.\n We show that these transitions imply a lower CCS for high birth rate less developed countries and contrary to the experience in lower birth rate, industrial countries, the CCS may increase after vaccination.\n We also consider the evolutionary implications of the CCS for the origin of measles;

areas, although there is renewed interest in understanding the seasonal drivers of respiratory viruses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe review geographic variations in seasonality of laboratory-confirmed influenza and RSV epidemics in 137 global locations based on literature review and electronic sources.\n\n We assessed peak timing and epidemic duration and explored their association with geography and study settings.\n\n We fitted time series model to weekly national data available from the WHO influenza surveillance system (FluNet) to further characterize seasonal parameters.\n\n\nResults\nInfluenza and RSV activity consistently peaked during winter months in temperate locales, while there was greater diversity in the tropics.\n\n Several temperate locations experienced semi-annual influenza activity with peaks occurring in winter and summer.\n\n Semi-annual activity was relatively common in tropical areas of Southeast Asia for both viruses.\n\n Biennial cycles of RSV activity were identified in Northern Europe.\n\n Both viruses exhibited weak latitudinal gradients in the timing of epidemics by hemisphere, with peak timing occurring later in the calendar year with increasing latitude (P&lt;0.03).\n\n Time series model applied to influenza data from 85 countries confirmed the presence of latitudinal gradients in timing, duration, seasonal amplitude, and between-year variability of epidemics.\n\n Overall, 80% of tropical locations experienced distinct RSV seasons lasting 6 months or less, while the percentage was 50% for influenza.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur review combining literature and electronic data sources suggests that a large fraction of tropical locations experience focused seasons of respiratory virus activity in individual years.\n\n Information on seasonal patterns remains limited in large undersampled regions, included Africa and Central America.\n\n Future studies should attempt to link the observed latitudinal gradients in seasonality of viral

Minimal important difference (MID) and Guyatt's responsiveness index were 10.3, 0.71 for the WURSS-21 and 18.5, 0.75 for the WURSS-44. Factorial analysis suggested an eight dimension structure for the WURSS-44 and a three dimension structure for the WURSS-21, with composite reliability coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.97, and Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.76 to 0.96. Both WURSS versions correlated significantly with the Jackson scale (W-21 R = 0.85; W-44 R = 0.88), with the SF-8 physical health (W-21 R = -0.79; W-44 R = -0.80) and SF-8 mental health (W-21 R = -0.55; W-44 R = -0.60).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe WURSS-44 and WURSS-21 perform well as illness-specific quality-of-life evaluative outcome instruments.\n\n Construct validity is supported by the data presented here.\n\n While the WURSS-44 covers more symptoms, the WURSS-21 exhibits similar performance in terms of reliability, responsiveness, importance-to-patients, and convergence with other measures.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2748069","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Bruce","surname":"Barrett","email":"bruce.barrett@fammed.wisc.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roger

selective trends in viral acute respiratory tract infections<","abstract":"Influenza A and B, and many unrelated viruses including rhinovirus, RSV, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and coronavirus share the same seasonality, since these viral acute respiratory tract infections (vARIs) are much more common in winter than summer.\n Unfortunately, early investigations that used recycled pedigree virus strains seem to have led microbiologists to dismiss the common folk belief that vARIs often follow chilling.\n Today, incontrovertible evidence shows that ambient temperature dips and host chilling increase the incidence and severity of vARIs.\n This review considers four possible mechanisms, M1 - 4, that can explain this link: (M1) increased crowding in winter may enhance viral transmission; (M2) lower temperatures may increase the stability of virions outside the body; (M3) chilling may increase host susceptibility; (M4) lower temperatures or host chilling may activate dormant virions.\n There is little evidence for M1 or M2, which are incompatible with tropical observations.\n Epidemiological anomalies such as the repeated simultaneous arrival of vARIs over wide geographical areas, the rapid cessation of influenza epidemics, and the low attack rate of influenza within families are compatible with M4, but not M3 (in its simple form).\n M4 seems to be the main driver of seasonality, but M3 may also play an important role.\n","id":"PMC7116927","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Patrick D.","surname":"Shaw

subtropical region: a 7-year surveillance in Okinawa, Japan","abstract":"Background\nThe epidemic patterns of influenza B infection and their association with climate conditions are not well understood.\n\n Influenza surveillance in Okinawa is important for clarifying transmission patterns in both temperate and tropical regions.\n\n Using surveillance data, collected over 7 years in the subtropical region of Japan, this study aims to characterize the epidemic patterns of influenza B infection and its association with ambient temperature and relative humidity, in a parallel comparison with influenza A.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom January 2007 until March 2014, two individual influenza surveillance datasets were collected from external sources.\n\n The first dataset, included weekly rapid antigen test (RAT) results from four representative general hospitals, located in the capital city of Okinawa.\n\n A nation-wide surveillance of influenza, diagnosed by RAT results and/or influenza-like illness symptoms, included the age distribution of affected patients and was used as the second dataset.\n\n To analyze the association between infection and local climate conditions, ambient temperature and relative humidity during the study period were retrieved from the Japanese Meteorological Agency website.\n\n\nResults\nAlthough influenza A maintained high number of infections from December through March, epidemics of influenza B infection were observed annually from March through July.\n\n The only observed exception was 2010, when the pandemic strain of 2009 dominated.\n\n During influenza B outbreaks, influenza patients aged 5 to 9 years old and 10 to 14 years old more frequently visited sentinel sites.\n\n Although both ambient temperature and relative humidity are inversely associated with influenza A infection, influenza B infection was found to be directly associated with high relative humidity.\n\n\nConclusion\nFurther studies are needed to elucidate the complex epidemiology of influenza B and its relationship with influenza A.\n\n In the subtropical setting of Okinawa, epidemics of influenza B infection occur from March to July following the influenza A epidemic, and primarily affect school-age children.\n\n These findings help to define unknown aspects of influenza B and can inform healthcare decisions for patients located outside temperate regions.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12879-016-1978-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

distinct patterns of circulating strains of the virus in different areas in India from 2009 to 2013.\nMethods\nPatients in ten cities presenting with influenza like illness in out-patient departments of dispensaries/hospitals and hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infections were enrolled.\n\n Nasopharangeal swabs were tested for influenza viruses by real-time RT-PCR, and subtyping; antigenic and genetic analysis were carried out using standard assays.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 44,127 ILI/SARI cases, 6,193 (14.0%) were positive for influenza virus.\n\n Peaks of influenza were observed during July-September coinciding with monsoon in cities Delhi and Lucknow (north), Pune (west), Allaphuza (southwest), Nagpur (central), Kolkata (east) and Dibrugarh (northeast), whereas Chennai and Vellore (southeast) revealed peaks in October-November, coinciding with the monsoon months in these cities.\n\n In Srinagar (Northern most city at 34°N latitude) influenza circulation peaked in January-March in winter months.\n\n The patterns of circulating strains varied over the years: whereas A/H1N1pdm09 and type B co-circulated in 2009 and 2010, H3N2 was the predominant circulating strain in 2011, followed by circulation of A/H1N1pdm09 and influenza B in 2012 and return of A/H3N2 in 2013. Antigenic analysis revealed that most circulating viruses were close to vaccine selected viral strains.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data shows that India, though physically located in northern hemisphere, has distinct seasonality that might be related to latitude and environmental factors.\n\n While cities with temperate seasonality will benefit from vaccination in September-October, cities with peaks in the monsoon season in July-September will benefit from vaccination in April-May.\n\n Continued surveillance is critical to understand regional differences in influenza seasonality at regional and sub-regional level, especially in countries with large latitude span.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4418715","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mandeep

Vaccinate?","abstract":"Background\nThe timing of the biannual WHO influenza vaccine composition selection and production cycle has been historically directed to the influenza seasonality patterns in the temperate regions of the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\n Influenza activity, however, is poorly understood in the tropics with multiple peaks and identifiable year-round activity.\n\n The evidence-base needed to take informed decisions on vaccination timing and vaccine formulation is often lacking for the tropics and subtropics.\n\n This paper aims to assess influenza seasonality in the tropics and subtropics.\n\n It explores geographical grouping of countries into vaccination zones based on optimal timing of influenza vaccination.\n\n\nMethods\nInfluenza seasonality was assessed by different analytic approaches (weekly proportion of positive cases, time series analysis, etc.\n\n) using FluNet and national surveillance data.\n\n In case of discordance in the seasonality assessment, consensus was built through discussions with in-country experts.\n\n Countries with similar onset periods of their primary influenza season were grouped into geographical zones.\n\n\nResults\nThe number and period of peak activity was ascertained for 70 of the 138 countries in the tropics and subtropics.\n\n Thirty-seven countries had one and seventeen countries had two distinct peaks.\n\n Countries near the equator had secondary peaks or even identifiable year-round activity.\n\n The main influenza season in most of South America and Asia started between April and June.\n\n The start of the main season varied widely in Africa (October and December in northern Africa, April and June in Southern Africa and a mixed pattern in tropical Africa).\n\n Eight influenza vaccination zones (two each in America and Asia, and four in Africa and Middle East) were defined with recommendations for vaccination timing and vaccine formulation.\n\n The main limitation of our study is that FluNet and national surveillance data may lack the granularity to detect sub-national variability in seasonality patterns.\n\n\nConclusion\nDistinct influenza seasonality patterns, though complex, could be ascertained for most countries in the tropics and subtropics using national surveillance data.\n\n It may be possible to group countries into zones based on similar recommendations for vaccine timing and

hypotheses.\n Traditional methods based on deterministic assumptions, such as ordinary differential equations (ODE), have been successful in those scenarios.\n However, noise caused by random variations rather than true differences is an intrinsic feature of the cellular/molecular/social world.\n Time series data from patients (in the case of clinical science) or number of infections (in the case of epidemics) can vary due to both intrinsic differences or incidental fluctuations.\n The use of traditional fitting methods for ODEs applied to noisy problems implies that deviation from some trend can only be due to error or parametric heterogeneity, that is noise can be wrongly classified as parametric heterogeneity.\n This leads to unstable predictions and potentially misguided policies or research programs.\n In this paper, we quantify the ability of ODEs under different hypotheses (fixed or random effects) to capture individual differences in the underlying data.\n We explore a simple (exactly solvable) example displaying an initial exponential growth by comparing state-of-the-art stochastic fitting and traditional least squares approximations.\n We also provide a potential approach for determining the limitations and risks of traditional fitting methodologies.\n Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the interpretation of data from the

caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·031·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·6112·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·024·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences;

Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively,

have been detected in bats, particularly those that reside in China, Europe, and Africa.\n To further understand the evolutionary relationship between SARS-CoV and its reservoirs, 334 bats were collected from Zhoushan city, Zhejiang province, China, between 2015 and 2017. PCR amplification of the conserved coronaviral protein RdRp detected coronaviruses in 26.65% of bats belonging to this region, and this number was influenced by seasonal changes.\n Full genomic analyses of the two new SL-CoVs from Zhoushan (ZXC21 and ZC45) showed that their genomes were 29,732 nucleotides (nt) and 29,802 nt in length, respectively, with 13 open reading frames (ORFs).\n These results revealed 81% shared nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs, which was more distant than that observed previously for bat SL-CoVs in China.\n Importantly, using pathogenic tests, we found that the virus can reproduce and cause disease in suckling rats, and further studies showed that the virus-like particles can be observed in the brains of suckling rats by electron microscopy.\n Thus, this study increased our understanding of the genetic diversity of the SL-CoVs carried by bats and also provided a new perspective to study the possibility of cross-species transmission of

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase

about the effect of artificial light on bats focused almost exclusively on non-migratory species, yet migratory animals such as birds are known to be largely affected by light pollution.\n Thus, we conducted a field experiment to evaluate if bat migration is affected by artificial light at night.\n In late summer, we presented artificial green light of 520 nm wavelength to bats that were migrating south along the shoreline of the Baltic Sea.\n Using a light on-off treatment, we observed that the activity of Pipistrellus nathusii and P.\n pygmaeus, the two most abundant migratory species at our site, increased by more than 50% in the light-on compared to the light-off treatment.\n We observed an increased number of feeding buzzes during the light-on compared to the light-off treatment for P.\n nathusii.\n However, feeding activity was low in general and did not increase disproportionately during the light-on treatment in relation to the overall echolocation call activity of bats.\n Further, P.\n nathusii were attracted towards the green light at a distance of about 23 m, which is way beyond the echolocation detection range for insects of Nathusius bats.\n We therefore infer that migratory bats were not attracted to artificial green light because of high insect densities, but instead by positive phototaxis.\n We conclude that artificial light at night may potentially impact bat migration in a yet unrecognized way.\n","id":"PMC5451015","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Christian

by red light but not by warm?white light: Implications for the protection of nocturnal migrants","abstract":"The replacement of conventional lighting with energy?saving light emitting diodes (LED) is a worldwide trend, yet its consequences for animals and ecosystems are poorly understood.\n Strictly nocturnal animals such as bats are particularly sensitive to artificial light at night (ALAN).\n Past studies have shown that bats, in general, respond to ALAN according to the emitted light color and that migratory bats, in particular, exhibit phototaxis in response to green light.\n As red and white light is frequently used in outdoor lighting, we asked how migratory bats respond to these wavelength spectra.\n At a major migration corridor, we recorded the presence of migrating bats based on ultrasonic recorders during 10?min light?on/light?off intervals to red or warm?white LED, interspersed with dark controls.\n When the red LED was switched on, we observed an increase in flight activity for Pipistrellus pygmaeus and a trend for a higher activity for Pipistrellus nathusii.\n As the higher flight activity of bats was not associated with increased feeding, we rule out the possibility that bats foraged at the red LED light.\n Instead, bats may have flown toward the red LED light source.\n When exposed to warm?white LED, general flight activity at the light source did not increase, yet we observed an increased foraging activity directly at the light source compared to the dark control.\n Our findings highlight a response of migratory bats toward LED light that was dependent on light color.\n The most parsimonious explanation for the response to red LED is phototaxis and for the response to warm?white LED foraging.\n Our findings call for caution in the application of red aviation lighting, particularly at wind turbines, as this light color might attract bats, leading eventually to an increased collision risk of migratory bats at wind turbines.\n","id":"PMC6194273","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Christian

changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·919·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·928·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·563·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·231·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·270·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·77·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·215·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·43·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·811·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·391·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·037·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Medical Research

Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage.\n\n China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production.\n\n However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic of China.\n\n Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy.\n\n\nFindings\nRegardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020).\n\n The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively.\n\n During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589·5, 49·3, and 37·5 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively.\n\n In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2·2 million.\n\n\nInterpretation\nImplementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage.\n\n Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks.\n\n These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic.\n\n To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers.\n\n The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions.\n\n Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7129293","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Huai-liang","surname":"Wu","email":"wuhuailiang@stu2014.jnu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Huang","email":"jian.huang@imperial.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Casper

Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 89 and a 5-min Apgar score of 910. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lanying","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David M.","surname":"Ojcius","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chungen","surname":"Pan","email":"chungenp@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shibo","surname":"Jiang","email":"shibojiang@fudan.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1164/rccm.2014P7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel Wuhan (2019-nCoV) coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.78.15.7863-7866.2004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus phylogeny: toward consensus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia (trial version 7) [J / OL].

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.101.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls.\n\n We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L) or lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L).\n\n\nFindings\nNormal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L), lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L), eosinopenia (&lt;0·02 109/L), and elevated hs-CRP (?4 mg/L) were presented in 95·0%, 52·2%, 74·7% and 86·7% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87·2%, 28·8%, 31·3% and 45·2% of the controls, respectively.\n\n The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74·7% and specificity of 68·7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0·717. The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67·9% and specificity of 78·2% (AUC=0·730).\n\n The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms.\n\n This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7196382","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qilin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiuli","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geqing","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heng-Gui","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fenghua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luming","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shijun","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"An","surname":"Pan","email":"panan@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Wang","email":"lin_wang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Wang","email":"zhengwang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017","date":"2020-03-09","title":"Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","abstract":"This case series study evaluates the association of underlying cardiovascular disease and myocardial injury on fatal outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n","id":"PMC7101506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongzhen","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hairong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinghuan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibing","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.

Prior to 2014, MERS-CoV was mostly associated with sporadic cases of human illness, of presumed zoonotic origin, though chains of person-to-person transmission in the healthcare setting were reported.\n In spring 2014, large healthcare-associated outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection occurred in Jeddah and Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n To date the epidemiological information published by public health investigators in affected jurisdictions has been relatively limited.\n However, it is important that the global public health community have access to information on the basic epidemiological features of the outbreak to date, including the basic reproduction number (R0) and best estimates of case-fatality rates (CFR).\n We sought to address these gaps using a publicly available line listing of MERS-CoV cases.\n\nMethods: R0 was estimated using the incidence decay with exponential adjustment (IDEA) method, while period-specific case fatality rates that incorporated non-attributed death data were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nResults: 707 cases were available for evaluation.\n 52% of cases were identified as primary, with the rest being secondary.\n IDEA model fits suggested a higher R0 in Jeddah (3.5-6.7) than in Riyadh (2.0-2.8); control parameters suggested more rapid reduction in transmission in the former city than the latter.\n The model accurately projected final size and end date of the Riyadh outbreak based on information available prior to the outbreak peak; for Jeddah, these projections were possible once the outbreak peaked.\n Overall case-fatality was 40%; depending on the timing of 171 deaths unlinked to case data, outbreak CFR could be higher, lower, or equivalent to pre-outbreak CFR.\n\nConclusions: Notwithstanding imperfect data, inferences about MERS-CoV epidemiology important for public health preparedness are possible using publicly available data sources.\n The R0 estimated in Riyadh appears similar to that seen for SARS-CoV, but CFR appears higher, and indirect evidence suggests control activities ended these outbreaks.\n These data suggest this disease should be regarded with equal or greater concern than the related SARS-CoV.\n","id":"PMC4322060","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maimuna S.","surname":"Majumder","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caitlin","surname":"Rivers","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Lofgren","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Fisman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

we set these thresholds at the country level, and then applied them to subnational locations.\n\n We applied a principal components analysis to construct the HAQ Index using all scaled cause values, providing an overall score of 0100 of personal health-care access and quality by location over time.\n\n We then compared HAQ Index levels and trends by quintiles on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary measure of overall development.\n\n As derived from the broader GBD study and other data sources, we examined relationships between national HAQ Index scores and potential correlates of performance, such as total health spending per capita.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2016, HAQ Index performance spanned from a high of 97·1 (95% UI 95·898·1) in Iceland, followed by 96·6 (94·997·9) in Norway and 96·1 (94·597·3) in the Netherlands, to values as low as 18·6 (13·124·4) in the Central African Republic, 19·0 (14·323·7) in Somalia, and 23·4 (20·226·8) in Guinea-Bissau.\n\n The pace of progress achieved between 1990 and 2016 varied, with markedly faster improvements occurring between 2000 and 2016 for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, whereas several countries in Latin America and elsewhere saw progress stagnate after experiencing considerable advances in the HAQ Index between 1990 and 2000. Striking subnational disparities emerged in personal health-care access and quality, with China and India having particularly large gaps between locations with the highest and lowest scores in 2016. In China, performance ranged from 91·5 (89·193·6) in Beijing to 48·0 (43·453·2) in Tibet (a 43·5-point difference), while India saw a 30·8-point disparity, from 64·8 (59·668·8) in Goa to 34·0 (30·338·1) in Assam.\n\n Japan recorded the smallest range in subnational HAQ performance in 2016 (a 4·8-point difference), whereas differences between subnational locations with the highest and lowest HAQ Index values were more than two times as high for the USA and three times as high for England.\n\n State-level gaps in the HAQ Index in Mexico somewhat narrowed from 1990 to 2016 (from a 20·9-point to 17·0-point difference), whereas in Brazil, disparities slightly increased across states during this time (a 17·2-point to 20·4-point difference).\n\n Performance on the HAQ Index showed strong linkages to overall development, with high and high-middle SDI countries generally having higher scores and faster gains for non-communicable diseases.\n\n Nonetheless, countries across the development spectrum saw substantial gains in some key health service areas from 2000 to 2016, most notably vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\n Overall, national performance on the HAQ Index was positively associated with higher levels of total health spending per capita, as well as health systems inputs, but these relationships were quite heterogeneous, particularly among low-to-middle SDI countries.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGBD 2016 provides a more detailed understanding of past success and current challenges in improving personal health-care access and quality worldwide.\n\n Despite substantial gains since 2000, many low-SDI and middle-SDI countries face considerable challenges unless heightened policy action and investments focus on advancing access to and quality of health care across key health services, especially non-communicable diseases.\n\n Stagnating or minimal improvements experienced by several low-middle to high-middle SDI countries could reflect the complexities of re-orienting both primary and secondary health-care services beyond the more limited foci of the Millennium Development Goals.\n\n Alongside initiatives to strengthen public health programmes, the pursuit of universal health coverage hinges upon improving both access and quality worldwide, and thus requires adopting a more comprehensive viewand subsequent provisionof quality health care for all populations.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates

We determined a crystal structure of the MP HA protein at 2.50 Å resolution and two structures of HP HA at 2.95 and 3.10 Å resolution.\n Residues 104 and 115 that modulate the acid stability of the HA

fusion.\n Consequently, the availability of activating proteases and the susceptibility of HA to protease activity represents key factors in facilitating virus infection.\n As such, understanding the intricacies of HA cleavage by various proteases is necessary to derive insights into the emergence of pandemic viruses.\n To examine these properties, we generated a panel of HAs that are representative of the 16 HA subtypes that circulate in aquatic birds, as well as HAs representative of the subtypes that have infected the human population over the last century.\n We examined the susceptibility of the panel of HA proteins to trypsin, as well as human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2).\n Additionally, we examined the pH at which these HAs mediated membrane fusion, as this property is related to the stability of the HA molecule and influences the capacity of influenza viruses to remain infectious in natural environments.\n Our results show that cleavage efficiency can vary significantly for individual HAs, depending on the protease, and that some HA subtypes display stringent selectivity for specific proteases as activators of fusion function.\n Additionally, we found that the pH of fusion varies by 0.7 pH units among the subtypes, and notably, we observed that the pH of fusion for most HAs from human isolates was lower than that observed from avian isolates of the same subtype.\n Overall, these data provide the first broad-spectrum analysis of cleavage-activation and membrane fusion characteristics for all of the IAV HA subtypes, and also show that there are substantial differences between the subtypes that may influence transmission among hosts and establishment in new

transmit efficiently among humans.\n The viral haemagglutinin (HA) protein is a known host range determinant since it mediates virus binding to host-specific cellular receptors13.\n Here, we therefore assessed the molecular changes in HA that would allow an H5 HA-possessing virus to transmit among mammals.\n We identified a reassortant virus with H5 HA possessing four mutations in a 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus backbone capable of droplet transmission in a ferret model.\n The transmissible H5 reassortant virus preferentially recognized human-type receptors, replicated efficiently in ferrets, caused lung lesions and weight loss, but it was not highly pathogenic and did not cause mortality.\n These results suggest that H5 HA can convert to an HA that supports efficient viral transmission in mammals.\n However, we do not know whether the four mutations in the H5 HA identified in this study would render a wholly avian H5N1 virus transmissible.\n The genetic origin of the remaining seven viral genes may also critically contribute to transmissibility in mammals.\n Nevertheless, as H5N1 viruses continue to evolve and infect humans, receptor-binding variants of H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential, including avian-human reassortant viruses as tested here, may emerge.\n Our findings emphasize the need for pandemic preparedness for H5 HA-possessing viruses and will

no consistent explanation for influenzas transmission patterns that applies to both temperate and tropical regions.\n This study aimed to determine the relationship between ambient humidity and viability of the influenza A virus (IAV) during transmission between hosts and to explain the mechanisms underlying it.\n We measured the viability of IAV in droplets consisting of various model media, chosen to isolate effects of salts and proteins found in respiratory fluid, and in human mucus, at relative humidities (RH) ranging from 17% to 100%.\n In all media and mucus, viability was highest when RH was either close to 100% or below ?50%.\n When RH decreased from 84% to 50%, the relationship between viability and RH depended on droplet composition: viability decreased in saline solutions, did not change significantly in solutions supplemented with proteins, and increased dramatically in mucus.\n Additionally, viral decay increased linearly with salt concentration in saline solutions but not when they were supplemented with proteins.\n There appear to be three regimes of IAV viability in droplets, defined by humidity: physiological conditions (?100% RH) with high viability, concentrated conditions (50% to near 100% RH) with lower viability depending on the composition of media, and dry conditions (&lt;50% RH) with high viability.\n This paradigm could help resolve conflicting findings in the literature on the relationship between IAV viability in aerosols and humidity, and results in human mucus could help explain influenzas seasonality in different

mediating virus infectivity.\n Using the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6, which has been suggested as a surrogate for influenza viruses and coronaviruses, we designed a study to discern whether AH, RH,

mid-range RHs (?60 to 85%).\n At an AH of less than 22 g · m?3, the loss in infectivity was less than 2 orders of magnitude; however, when the AH was greater than 22 g · m?3, the loss in infectivity was typically greater than 6 orders of magnitude.\n At a fixed RH of 75%, infectivity was very sensitive to temperature, decreasing two orders of magnitude between 19°C and 25°C.\n We used random forest modeling to identify the best environmental predictors for modulating virus infectivity.\n The model explained 83% of variation in Phi6 infectivity and suggested that RH is the most important

relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence

of airborne transmission via aerosols is increased at lower humidities and temperatures, conditions that prevail in wintertime.\n Recent work with a guinea pig model by Lowen et al.\n indicated that humidity and temperature do modulate airborne influenza virus transmission, and several investigators have interpreted the observed humidity dependence in terms of airborne virus survivability.\n This interpretation, however, neglects two key observations: the effect of ambient temperature on the viral growth kinetics within the animals, and the strong influence of the background airflow on transmission.\n Here we provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for assessing the probability of disease transmission via expiratory aerosols between test animals in laboratory conditions.\n The spread of aerosols emitted from an infected animal is modeled using dispersion theory for a homogeneous turbulent airflow.\n The concentration and size distribution of the evaporating droplets in the resulting Gaussian breath plume are calculated as functions of position, humidity, and temperature.\n The overall transmission probability is modeled with a combination of the time-dependent viral concentration in the infected animal and the probability of droplet inhalation by the exposed animal downstream.\n We demonstrate that the breath plume model is broadly consistent with the results of Lowen et al.\n, without invoking airborne virus survivability.\n The results also suggest that, at least for guinea pigs, variation in viral kinetics within the infected animals is the dominant factor

level.\n Further analysis shows that ferret transmission experiments have potential to identify influenza viruses of concern for epidemic spread in humans, though small sample sizes and biological uncertainties prevent definitive classification of human transmissibility.\n Thus, ferret transmission experiments provide valid predictions of pandemic potential of novel influenza strains, though results should continue to be corroborated by targeted virological and epidemiological research.\n","id":"PMC4586390","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael

by aerosols remains controversial, in part, because little is known about the quantity and size of potentially infectious airborne particles produced by people with influenza.\n In this study, the size and amount of aerosol particles produced by nine subjects during coughing were measured while they had influenza and after they had recovered, using a laser aerosol particle spectrometer with a size range of 0.35 to 10 ?m.\n Individuals with influenza produce a significantly greater volume of aerosol when ill compared with afterward (p = 0.0143).\n When the patients had influenza, their average cough aerosol volume was 38.3 picoliters (pL) of particles per cough (SD 43.7); after patients recovered, the average volume was 26.4 pL per cough (SD 45.6).\n The number of particles produced per cough was also higher when subjects had influenza (average 75,400 particles/cough, SD 97,300) compared with afterward (average 52,200, SD 98,600), although the difference did not reach statistical

fraction (SD 22%), indicating that these particles could reach the alveolar region of the lungs if inhaled by another person.\n This enhancement in aerosol generation during illness may play an important role in influenza transmission and suggests that a better understanding of this phenomenon is needed to predict the production and dissemination of influenza-laden aerosols by people

Dromedary camels are the only animal species for which there is convincing evidence that it is a host species for MERS?CoV and hence a potential source of human infections.\n However, only a small proportion of the primary cases have reported contact with camels.\n Other possible sources and vehicles of infection include food?borne transmission through consumption of unpasteurized camel milk

epidemiological investigations and studies designed to test hypothesis regarding sources of infection and risk factors for disease.\n Since the 1960s, there has been a radical change in dromedary camel farming practices in the Arabian Peninsula with an intensification of the production and a concentration of the production around cities.\n It is possible that the recent intensification of camel herding in the Arabian Peninsula has increased the virus' reproductive number and attack rate in camel herds while the urbanization of camel herding increased the frequency of zoonotic

transmission mode of many infectious diseases.\n Climate change affects infectious diseases directly and indirectly.\n Meteorological factors including temperature, precipitation, humidity and radiation influence infectious disease by modulating pathogen, host and transmission pathways.\n Meteorological disasters such as droughts and floods directly impact the outbreak and transmission of infectious diseases.\n Climate change indirectly impacts infectious diseases by altering the ecological system, including its underlying surface and vegetation distribution.\n In addition, anthropogenic activities are a driving force for climate change and an indirect forcing of infectious disease transmission.\n International travel and rural-urban migration are a root cause of infectious disease transmission.\n Rapid urbanization along with poor infrastructure and high disease risk in the rural-urban fringe has been changing the pattern of disease outbreaks and mortality.\n Land use changes, such as agricultural expansion and deforestation, have already changed the transmission of infectious disease.\n Accelerated air, road and rail transportation development may not only increase the transmission speed of outbreaks, but also enlarge the scope of transmission area.\n In addition, more frequent trade and other economic activities will also increase the potential risks of disease outbreaks and facilitate the spread of infectious diseases.\n","id":"PMC7104601","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"XiaoXu","surname":"Wu","email":"wuxx@bnu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"HuaiYu","surname":"Tian","email":"tianhuaiyu@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sen","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"LiFan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bing","surname":"Xu","email":"bingxu@tsinghua.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.1063699","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Climate

Heterogeneity between Japanese Encephalitis Incidence Distribution and Environmental Variables in Nepal","abstract":"Background\nTo identify potential environmental drivers of Japanese Encephalitis virus (JE) transmission in Nepal, we conducted an ecological study to determine the spatial association between 2005 Nepal JE incidence, and climate, agricultural, and land-cover variables at district level.\n\n\nMethods\nDistrict-level data on JE cases were examined using Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis to identify spatial clusters from 2004 to 2008 and 2005 data was used to fit a spatial lag regression model with climate, agriculture and land-cover variables.\n\n\nResults\nPrior to 2006, there was a single large cluster of JE cases located in the Far-West and Mid-West terai regions of Nepal.\n\n After 2005, the distribution of JE cases in Nepal shifted with clusters found in the central hill areas.\n\n JE incidence during the 2005 epidemic had a stronger association with May mean monthly temperature and April mean monthly total precipitation compared to mean annual temperature and precipitation.\n\n A parsimonious spatial lag regression model revealed, 1) a significant negative relationship between JE incidence and April precipitation, 2) a significant positive relationship between JE incidence and percentage of irrigated land 3) a non-significant negative relationship between JE incidence and percentage of grassland cover, and 4) a unimodal non-significant relationship between JE Incidence and pig-to-human ratio.\n\n\nConclusion\nJE cases clustered in the terai prior to 2006 where it seemed to shift to the Kathmandu region in subsequent years.\n\n The spatial pattern of JE cases during the 2005 epidemic in Nepal was significantly associated with low precipitation and the percentage of irrigated land.\n\n Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, it is still important to understand environmental drivers of JEV transmission since the enzootic cycle of JEV transmission is not likely to be totally interrupted.\n\n Understanding the spatial dynamics of JE risk factors may be useful in providing important information to the Nepal immunization program.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3141013","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniel

malaria incidence in these areas of unstable malaria transmission has been attributed to a variety of changes including global warming.\n To determine whether the reemergence of malaria in western Kenya could be attributed to changes in meteorologic conditions, we tested for trends in a continuous 30-year monthly malaria incidence dataset (19661995) obtained from complete hospital registers at a Kenyan tea plantation.\n Contemporary monthly meteorologic data (19661995) that originated from the tea estate meteorologic station and from global climatology records were also tested for trends.\n We found that total hospital admissions (malaria and nonmalaria) remained unchanged while malaria admissions increased significantly during the period.\n We also found that all meteorologic variables showed no trends for significance, even when combined into a monthly suitability index for malaria transmission.\n We conclude that climate changes have not caused the highland malaria

The sole isolate obtained from the cerebrospinal fluid showed unique changes in nsP1 (T301I), nsP2 (Y642N), and nsP3 (E460 deletion), not obtained from isolates from sera.\n\n In the structural proteins region, two noteworthy changes (A226V and D284E) were observed in the membrane fusion glycoprotein E1. Homology 3D modelling allowed mapping of these two changes to regions that are important for membrane fusion and virion assembly.\n\n Change E1-A226V was absent in the initial strains but was observed in &gt;90% of subsequent viral sequences from Réunion, denoting evolutionary success possibly due to adaptation to the mosquito vector.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe unique molecular features of the analyzed

performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission.\n The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence

the pathogen, vector, and host, the potential influence of climate change on vector-borne and zoonotic diseases (VBZDs) is poorly understood and difficult to predict.\n\n Climate effects on the nonvector-borne zoonotic diseases are especially obscure and have received scant treatment.\n\n\nObjective\nWe described known and potential effects of climate change on VBZDs and proposed specific studies to increase our understanding of these effects.\n\n The nonvector-borne zoonotic diseases have received scant treatment and are emphasized in this paper.\n\n\nData sources and synthesis\nWe used a review of the existing literature and extrapolations from observations of short-term climate variation to suggest potential impacts of climate change on VBZDs.\n\n Using public health priorities on climate change, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we developed six specific goals for increasing understanding of the interaction between climate and VBZDs and for improving capacity for predicting climate change effects on incidence and distribution of VBZDs.\n\n\nConclusions\nClimate change may affect the incidence of VBZDs through its effect on four principal characteristics of host and vector populations that relate to pathogen transmission to humans: geographic distribution, population density, prevalence of infection by zoonotic pathogens, and the pathogen load in individual hosts and vectors.\n\n These mechanisms may interact with each other and with other factors such as anthropogenic disturbance to produce varying effects on pathogen transmission within host and vector populations and to humans.\n\n Because climate change effects on most VBZDs act through wildlife hosts and vectors, understanding these effects will require multidisciplinary teams to conduct and interpret ecosystem-based studies of VBZD pathogens in host and vector populations and to identify the hosts, vectors, and pathogens with the greatest potential to affect human populations under climate change scenarios.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2974686","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"James

in the geographical distribution and abundance of the tick <italic>Ixodes ricinus </italic>during the past 30 years in Sweden","abstract":"Background\nIxodes ricinus is the main vector in Europe of human-pathogenic Lyme borreliosis (LB) spirochaetes, the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and other pathogens of humans and domesticated mammals.\n\n The results of a previous 1994 questionnaire, directed at people living in Central and North Sweden (Svealand and Norrland) and aiming to gather information about tick exposure for humans and domestic animals, suggested that Ixodes ricinus ticks had become more widespread in Central Sweden and the southern part of North Sweden from the early 1980s to the early 1990s.\n\n To investigate whether the expansion of the tick's northern geographical range and the increasing abundance of ticks in Sweden were still occurring, in 2009 we performed a follow-up survey 16 years after the initial study.\n\n\nMethods\nA questionnaire similar to the one used in the 1994 study was published in Swedish magazines aimed at dog owners, home owners, and hunters.\n\n The questionnaire was published together with a popular science article about the tick's biology and role as a pathogen vector in Sweden.\n\n The magazines were selected to get information from people familiar with ticks and who spend time in areas where ticks might be present.\n\n\nResults\nAnalyses of data from both surveys revealed that during the near 30-year period from the early 1980s to 2008, I.\n\n ricinus has expanded its distribution range northwards.\n\n In the early 1990s ticks were found in new areas along the northern coastline of the Baltic Sea, while in the 2009 study, ticks were reported for the first time from many locations in North Sweden.\n\n This included locations as far north as 66°N and places in the interior part of North Sweden.\n\n During this 16-year period the tick's range in Sweden was estimated to have increased by 9.9%.\n\n Most of the range expansion occurred in North Sweden (north of 60°N) where the tick's coverage area doubled from 12.5% in the early 1990s to 26.8% in 2008. Moreover, according to the respondents, the abundance of ticks had increased markedly in LB- and TBE-endemic areas in South (Götaland) and Central Sweden.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results suggest that I.\n\n ricinus has expanded its range in North Sweden and has become distinctly more abundant in Central and South Sweden during the last three decades.\n\n However, in the northern mountain region I.\n\n ricinus is still absent.\n\n The increased abundance of the tick can be explained by two main factors: First, the high availability of large numbers of important tick maintenance hosts, i.\n\ne.\n\n, cervids, particularly roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) during the last three decades.\n\n Second, a warmer climate with milder winters and a prolonged growing season that permits greater survival and proliferation over a larger geographical area of both the tick itself and deer.\n\n High reproductive potential of roe deer, high tick infestation rate and the tendency of roe deer to disperse great distances may explain the range expansion of I.\n\n ricinus and particularly the appearance of new TBEV foci far away from old TBEV-endemic localities.\n\n The geographical presence of LB in Sweden corresponds to the distribution of I.\n\n ricinus.\n\n Thus, LB is now an emerging disease risk in many parts of North Sweden.\n\n Unless countermeasures are undertaken to keep the deer populations, particularly C.\n\n capreolus and Dama dama, at the relatively low levels that prevailed before the late 1970s - especially in and around urban areas where human population density is high - by e.\n\ng.\n\n reduced hunting of red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and lynx (Lynx lynx), the incidences of human LB and TBE are expected to continue to be high or even to increase in Sweden in coming decades.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3311093","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas

35?±?1°C), 75?±?5% relative humidity.\n\n Upon emergence into imagoes, individual adult females were either left at their larval temperature or placed at a different temperature within the range

temperature is one of the keys to understanding the current and future dynamics and distribution of vector-borne diseases such as malaria.\n\n Many process-based models use mean air temperature to estimate larval development times, and hence adult vector densities and/or malaria risk.\n\n\nMethods\nWater temperatures in three different-sized water pools, as well as the adjacent air temperature in lowland and highland sites in western Kenya were monitored.\n\n Both air and water temperatures were fed into a widely-applied temperature-dependent development model for Anopheles gambiae immatures, and subsequently their impact on predicted vector abundance was assessed.\n\n\nResults\nMean water temperature in typical mosquito breeding sites was 4-6°C higher than the mean temperature of the adjacent air, resulting in larval development rates, and hence population growth rates, that are much higher than predicted based on air temperature.\n\n On the other hand, due to the non-linearities in the relationship between temperature and larval development rate, together with a marginal buffering in the increase in water temperature compared with air temperature, the relative increases in larval development rates predicted due to climate change are substantially less.\n\n\nConclusions\nExisting models will tend to underestimate mosquito population growth under current

Orbiviruses in <italic>Culicoides</italic> Biting Midges","abstract":"Background\nThe rate at which viruses replicate and disseminate in competent arthropod vectors is limited by the temperature of their environment, and this can be an important determinant of geographical and seasonal limits to their transmission by arthropods in temperate regions.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nHere, we present a novel statistical methodology for estimating the relationship between temperature and the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) and apply it to both published and novel data on virus replication for three internationally important orbiviruses (African horse sickness virus (AHSV), bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV)) in their Culicoides vectors.\n\n Our analyses show that there can be differences in vector competence for different orbiviruses in the same vector species and for the same orbivirus in different vector species.\n\n Both the rate of virus replication (approximately 0.017-0.021 per degree-day) and the minimum temperature required for replication (11-13°C), however, were generally consistent for different orbiviruses and across different Culicoides vector species.\n\n The estimates obtained in the present study suggest that previous publications have underestimated the replication rate and threshold temperature because the statistical methods they used included an implicit assumption that all negative vectors were infected.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nRobust estimates of the temperature dependence of arbovirus replication are essential for building accurate models of transmission and for informing policy decisions about seasonal relaxations to movement restrictions.\n\n The methodology developed in this study provides the required robustness and is superior to methods used previously.\n\n Importantly, the methods are generic and can readily be applied to other arbovirus-vector systems, as long as the assumptions described in the text are valid.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3220716","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Carpenter","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anthony","surname":"Wilson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James","surname":"Barber","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eva","surname":"Veronesi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philip","surname":"Mellor","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gert","surname":"Venter","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Gubbins","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gavin

With spatiotemporal transmission along each route, genetic distances to isolate A/goose/Guangdong/1996 are becoming significantly larger, leading to a more challenging situation in certain regions

and present a serious threat to the health of humans and wild birds.\n Noncommercial poultry operations, such as backyard poultry facilities in China, are potential sources of virus exchange between commercial poultry and wild birds.\n It is particularly critical in wetland areas where backyard poultry have close contact with commercial poultry and migratory birds, therefore increasing the risk of contracting infectious diseases.\n To evaluate the transmission risks, a cross-sectional study was undertaken in the Poyang Lake area, China, involving 309 residents in the backyard poultry farms in three counties (Region A, B, and C) of Jiangxi Province.\n We examined the backyard poultry population, poultry species, presence of poultry deaths from infectious diseases, food sources, and biosecurity practices.\n Region B ranked highest for biosecurity while region C ranked lowest.\n The risks of infectious diseases were assessed by adjusted odds ratio based on multivariate logistic regression analysis.\n Potential risk factors in the three regions of the study site were compared.\n In Region A, significant factor was contact of poultry with wild birds (OR: 6.573, 95% CI: 2.14820.115, P=0.001).\n In Region B, the most significant factor was contact of poultry with neighboring backyard waterfowls (OR: 3.967, 95% CI: 1.55510.122, P=0.004).\n In Region C, significant factors were poultry purchase from local live bird markets (OR: 3.740, 95% CI: 1.24311.255, P=0.019), and contact of poultry with wild birds (OR: 3.379, 95% CI: 1.05810.791, P=0.040).\n In summary, backyard poultry was significantly affected by neighboring commercial poultry and close contact with wild birds.\n The results are expected to improve our understanding of the transmission risks of infectious diseases in a typical backyard poultry environment in rural China, and address the need to improve local farming practices and take preventive

climate change, but there are competing views on what responsibilities and obligations this willor shouldinclude in different nations.\n This study aims to: (1) examine how national-level public health adaptation is occurring in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries; (2) examine the roles national governments are taking in public health adaptation; and (3) critically appraise three key governance dimensions of national-level health adaptationcross-sectoral collaboration, vertical coordination and national health adaptation planningand identify practical examples suited to different contexts.\n We systematically reviewed publicly available public health adaptation to climate change documents and webpages by national governments in ten OECD countries using systematic web searches, assessment of self-reporting, and content analysis.\n Our findings suggest national governments are primarily addressing infectious disease and heat-related risks posed by climate change, typically emphasizing capacity building or information-based groundwork initiatives.\n We find national governments are taking a variety of approaches to public health adaptation to climate change that do not follow expected convergence and divergence by governance structure.\n We discuss practical options for incorporating cross-sectoral collaboration, vertical coordination and national health adaptation planning into a variety of contexts and identify leaders national governments can look to to inform their public health adaptation planning.\n Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement and subsequent increased momentum for adaptation, research tracking adaptation is needed to define what health adaptation looks like in practice, reveal insights that

population ageing are significant public health challenges.\n\n Understanding which health problems are affected by temperature is important for preventing heat and cold-related deaths and illnesses, particularly in the elderly.\n\n Here we present a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of ambient hot and cold temperature (excluding heat/cold wave only studies) on elderly (65 + years) mortality and morbidity.\n\n\nMethods\nTime-series or case-crossover studies comprising cause-specific cases of elderly mortality (n = 3,933,398) or morbidity (n = 12,157,782) were pooled to obtain a percent change (%) in risk for temperature exposure on cause-specific disease outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis.\n\n\nResults\nA 1 °C temperature rise increased cardiovascular (3.44%, 95% CI 3.103.78), respiratory (3.60%, 3.184.02), and cerebrovascular (1.40%, 0.062.75) mortality.\n\n A 1 °C temperature reduction increased respiratory (2.90%, 1.843.97) and cardiovascular (1.66%, 1.192.14) mortality.\n\n The greatest risk was associated with cold-induced pneumonia (6.89%, 2012.99) and respiratory morbidity (4.93% 1.548.44).\n\n A 1 °C temperature rise

performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission.\n The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza epidemiology and

Megacity of China","abstract":"Background\nMany studies have found extreme temperature can increase the risk of mortality.\n\n However, it is not clear whether extreme diurnal temperature range (DTR) is associated with daily disease-specific mortality, and how season might modify any association.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo better understand the acute effect of DTR on mortality and identify whether season is a modifier of the DTR effect.\n\n\nMethods\nThe distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was applied to assess the non-linear and delayed effects of DTR on deaths (non-accidental mortality (NAD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory disease (RD) and cerebrovascular disease (CBD)) in the full year, the cold season and the warm season.\n\n\nResults\nA non-linear relationship was consistently found between extreme DTR and mortality.\n\n Immediate effects of extreme low DTR on all types of mortality were stronger than those of extreme high DTR in the full year.\n\n The cumulative effects of extreme DTRs increased with the increment of lag days for all types of mortality in cold season, and they were greater for extreme high DTRs than those of extreme low DTRs.\n\n In hot season, the cumulative effects for extreme low DTRs increased with the increment of lag days, but for extreme high DTR they reached maxima at a lag of 13 days for all types of mortality except

Three methodologies were used to evaluate the isolated association: time-series analysis using Poisson regression model, bidirectional case-crossover analysis matched by period, and case-crossover analysis matched by the confounding factor, i.\n\ne.\n\n, average temperature or pollutant concentration.\n\n The graphical representation of the response surface, generated by the interaction term

the case-crossover and time-series analyses.\n\n The percentage change in the relative risk of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was 0.85% (0.45;1.25) and 1.60% (0.74;2.46), respectively, due to an increase of 10 ?g/m3 in the PM10 concentration.\n\n The pattern of correlation of the temperature with cardiovascular mortality was U-shaped and that with respiratory mortality was J-shaped,

2003 SARS epidemic","abstract":"Since the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, social scientists and sociologists of health and illness have been exploring the metaphorical framing of this infectious disease in its social context.\n Many have focused on the militaristic language used to report and explain this illness, a type of language that has permeated discourses of immunology, bacteriology and infection for at least a century.\n In this article, we examine how language and metaphor were used in the UK media's coverage of another previously unknown and severe infectious disease: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n SARS offers an opportunity to explore the cultural framing of a less extraordinary epidemic disease.\n It therefore provides an analytical counter-weight to the very extensive body of interpretation that has developed around HIV/AIDS.\n By analysing the total reporting on SARS of five major national newspapers during the epidemic of spring 2003, we investigate how the reporting of SARS in the UK press was framed, and how this related to media, public and governmental responses to the disease.\n We found that, surprisingly, militaristic language was largely absent, as was the judgemental discourse of plague.\n Rather, the main conceptual metaphor used was SARS as a killer.\n SARS as a killer was a single unified entity, not an army or force.\n We provide some tentative explanations for this shift in linguistic framing by relating it to local political concerns, media cultures, and spatial factors.\n","id":"PMC7117051","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Wallis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Brigitte","surname":"Nerlich","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration.\n To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d.\n The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 4060 ng/mL (100150 nmol/L).\n For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful.\n Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.\n","id":"PMC7231123","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"William B.","surname":"Grant","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Henry","surname":"Lahore","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Henry","surname":"Lahore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sharon L.","surname":"McDonnell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carole A.","surname":"Baggerly","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christine B.","surname":"French","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Christine B.","surname":"French","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jennifer L.","surname":"Aliano","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jennifer L.","surname":"Aliano","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Harjit P.","surname":"Bhattoa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Panorama Rio de Janeiro","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ventilation of wards and nosocomial outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome among healthcare workers","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138513","date":"2020-04-05","title":"Impact of meteorological factors on the COVID-19 transmission: A multi-city study in China","abstract":"The purpose of the present study is to explore the associations between novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case counts and meteorological factors in 30 provincial capital cities of China.\n We compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, ambient temperature (AT), diurnal temperature range (DTR), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) for each city during the period of January 20th to March 2nd, 2020.

enveloped bacteriophage Phi6, which has been suggested as a surrogate for influenza viruses and coronaviruses, we designed a study to discern whether AH, RH, or temperature is a better predictor of virus survival in droplets.\n Our results show that Phi6 survived best at high (&gt;85%) and low (&lt;60%) RHs, with a significant decrease in infectivity at mid-range RHs (?60 to 85%).\n At an AH of less than 22 g · m?3, the loss in infectivity was less than 2 orders of magnitude; however, when the AH was greater than 22 g · m?3, the loss in infectivity was typically greater than 6 orders of magnitude.\n At a fixed RH of 75%, infectivity was very sensitive to temperature, decreasing two orders of magnitude between 19°C and 25°C.\n We used random forest modeling to identify the best environmental predictors for modulating virus infectivity.\n The model explained 83% of variation in Phi6 infectivity and suggested that RH is the most important factor in controlling virus

specific humidity conditions facilitate the airborne survival and transmission of the influenza virus in temperate regions, resulting in annual winter epidemics.\n However, this relationship is unlikely to account for the epidemiology of influenza in tropical and subtropical regions where epidemics often occur during the rainy season or transmit year-round without a well-defined season.\n We assessed the role of specific humidity and other local climatic variables on influenza virus seasonality by modeling epidemiological and climatic information from 78 study sites sampled globally.\n We substantiated that there are two types of environmental conditions associated with seasonal influenza epidemics: cold-dry and humid-rainy.\n For sites where monthly average specific humidity or temperature decreases below thresholds of approximately 1112 g/kg and 1821°C during the year, influenza activity peaks during the cold-dry season (i.\ne.\n, winter) when specific humidity and temperature are at minimal levels.\n For sites where specific humidity and temperature do not decrease below these thresholds, seasonal influenza activity is more likely to peak in months when average precipitation totals are maximal and greater than 150 mm per month.\n These findings provide a simple climate-based model rooted in empirical data that accounts for the diversity of seasonal influenza

South-East Queensland, Australia: an observational study","abstract":"Objective\nFoodborne illnesses in Australia, including salmonellosis, are estimated to cost over $A1.25 billion annually.\n\n The weather has been identified as being influential on salmonellosis incidence, as cases increase during summer, however time series modelling of salmonellosis is challenging because outbreaks cause strong autocorrelation.\n\n This study assesses whether switching models is an improved method of estimating weathersalmonellosis associations.\n\n\nDesign\nWe analysed weather and salmonellosis in South-East Queensland between 2004 and 2013 using 2 common regression models and a switching model, each with 21-day lags for temperature and precipitation.\n\n\nResults\nThe switching model best fit the data, as judged by its substantial improvement in deviance information criterion over the regression models, less autocorrelated residuals and control of seasonality.\n\n The switching model estimated a 5°C increase in mean temperature and 10?mm precipitation were associated with increases in salmonellosis cases of 45.4% (95% CrI 40.4%, 50.5%) and 24.1% (95% CrI 17.0%, 31.6%), respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nSwitching models improve on traditional time series models in quantifying weathersalmonellosis associations.\n\n A better understanding of how temperature and precipitation influence salmonellosis may identify where interventions can be made to lower the health and economic costs of salmonellosis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4769393","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dimity

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

The implementation of strict measures for social distancing is challenging, including in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) due to its level of urbanization, its social and religious norms and its annual hosting of high visibility international religious mass gatherings.\n KSA started introducing decisive social distancing measures early before the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Kingdom.\n These ranged from suspension or cancelations of religious, entertainment and sporting mass gatherings and events such as the Umrah, temporary closure of educational establishments and mosques and postponing all non-essential gatherings, to imposing a curfew.\n These measures were taken in spite of their socio-economic, political and religious challenges in the interest of public and global health.\n The effect of these actions on the epidemic curve of the Kingdom and on the global fight against COVID-19 remains to be seen.\n However, given the current COVID-19 situation, further bold and probably unpopular measures are likely to be introduced in the future.\n","id":"PMC7172679","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Saber","surname":"Yezli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anas","surname":"Khan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 89 and a 5-min Apgar score of 910. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

context, understanding the factors contributing to SARS-CoV-2 persistence on surfaces will enable a more accurate estimation of the risk of contact transmission and inform mitigation strategies.\n To this end, we have developed a simple mathematical model that can be used to estimate virus decay on nonporous surfaces under a range of conditions and which may be utilized operationally to identify

To better inform vaccination policy, we used mathematical models to evaluate the effect of prospective vaccination against EV-A71-associated HFMD and the potential risk of serotype replacement by CV-A16. We also extended the model to address the co-circulation, and implications for vaccination, of additional non-EV-A71, non-CV-A16 serotypes of enterovirus.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nWeekly reports of HFMD incidence from 31 provinces in Mainland China from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013 were used to fit multi-serotype time series susceptibleinfectedrecovered (TSIR) epidemic models.\n\n We obtained good model fit for the two-serotype TSIR with cross-protection, capturing the seasonality and geographic heterogeneity of province-level transmission, with strong correlation between the observed and simulated epidemic series.\n\n The national estimate of the basic reproduction number, R\n0, weighted by provincial population size, was 26.63 for EV-A71 (interquartile range [IQR]: 23.14, 30.40) and 27.13 for CV-A16 (IQR: 23.15, 31.34), with considerable variation between provinces (however, predictions about the overall impact of vaccination were robust to this variation).\n\n EV-A71 incidence was projected to decrease monotonically with higher coverage rates of EV-A71 vaccination.\n\n Across provinces, CV-A16 incidence in the post-EV-A71-vaccination period remained either comparable to or only slightly increased from levels prior to vaccination.\n\n The duration and strength of cross-protection following infection with EV-A71 or CV-A16 was estimated to be 9.95 wk (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.31, 23.40) in 68% of the population (95% CI: 37%, 96%).\n\n Our predictions are limited by the necessarily short and under-sampled time series and the possible circulation of unidentified serotypes, but, nonetheless, sensitivity analyses indicate that our results are robust in predicting that the vaccine should drastically reduce incidence of EV-A71 without a substantial competitive release of CV-A16.\nConclusions\nThe ability of our models to capture the observed epidemic cycles suggests that herd immunity is driving the epidemic dynamics caused by the multiple serotypes of enterovirus.\n\n Our results predict that the EV-A71 and CV-A16 serotypes provide a temporary immunizing effect against each other.\n\n Achieving high coverage rates of EV-A71 vaccination would be necessary to eliminate the ongoing transmission of EV-A71, but serotype replacement by CV-A16 following EV-A71 vaccination is likely to be transient and minor compared to the corresponding reduction in the burden of EV-A71-associated HFMD.\n\n Therefore, a mass EV-A71 vaccination program of infants and young children should provide significant benefits in terms of a reduction in overall HFMD burden.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4755668","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Saki","surname":"Takahashi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qiaohong","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas P.","surname":"Van Boeckel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weijia","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junling","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Victor Y.","surname":"Hsiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"C.

context, understanding the factors contributing to SARS-CoV-2 persistence on surfaces will enable a more accurate estimation of the risk of contact transmission and inform mitigation strategies.\n To this end, we have developed a simple mathematical model that can be used to estimate virus decay on nonporous surfaces under a range of conditions and which may be utilized operationally to identify

contagious disease and simulate its spatiotemporal transmission dynamics via the Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) method.\n The BME reveals that SARS outbreaks show autocorrelation within certain spatial and temporal distances.\n We use BME to fit a theoretical covariance model that has a sine hole spatial component and exponential temporal component and obtain the weights of geographical and temporal autocorrelation factors.\n Using the covariance model, SARS dynamics were estimated and simulated under the most probable conditions.\n Our study suggests that SARS transmission varies in its epidemiological characteristics and SARS outbreak distributions exhibit palpable clusters on both spatial and temporal scales.\n In addition, the BME modelling demonstrates that SARS transmission features are affected by spatial heterogeneity, so we analyze potential causes.\n This may benefit epidemiological control of pandemic infectious

Transmission Is Dependent on Relative Humidity and Temperature","abstract":"Using the guinea pig as a model host, we show that aerosol spread of influenza virus is dependent upon both ambient relative humidity and temperature.\n Twenty experiments performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission.\n The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza epidemiology and evolution.\n","id":"PMC2034399","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anice

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 2324, 2020.

The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·87·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227805), 113 (57193), 98 (49168), 111 (56191), and 80 (40139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 12 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.21037/jtd.2020.02.64","date":"2020-02-28","title":"Modified SEIR and AI prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in China under public health interventions","abstract":"Background\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak originating in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, coincided with chunyun, the period of mass migration for the annual Spring Festival.\n\n To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23 2020.

performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission.\n The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence

Three methodologies were used to evaluate the isolated association: time-series analysis using Poisson regression model, bidirectional case-crossover analysis matched by period, and case-crossover analysis matched by the confounding factor, i.\n\ne.\n\n, average temperature or pollutant concentration.\n\n The graphical representation of the response surface, generated by the interaction term between these factors added to the Poisson regression model, was interpreted to evaluate the synergistic effect of the risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo differences were observed between the results of the case-crossover and time-series analyses.\n\n The percentage change in the relative risk of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was 0.85% (0.45;1.25) and 1.60% (0.74;2.46), respectively, due to an increase of 10 ?g/m3 in the PM10 concentration.\n\n The pattern of correlation of the temperature with cardiovascular mortality was U-shaped and that with respiratory mortality was J-shaped, indicating an increased relative risk at high temperatures.\n\n The values for the interaction term indicated a higher relative risk for cardiovascular and respiratory mortalities at low temperatures

concentration is not confounded by temperature, and the effect of temperature is not confounded by the pollutant levels in the time-series analysis.\n\n The simultaneous exposure to different levels of environmental factors can create synergistic effects that are as disturbing as those caused by extreme

2003 SARS epidemic","abstract":"Since the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, social scientists and sociologists of health and illness have been exploring the metaphorical framing of this infectious disease in its social context.\n Many have focused on the militaristic language used to report and explain this illness, a type of language that has permeated discourses of immunology, bacteriology and infection for at least a century.\n In this article, we examine how language and metaphor were used in the UK media's coverage of another previously unknown and severe infectious disease: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n SARS offers an opportunity to explore the cultural framing of a less extraordinary epidemic disease.\n It therefore provides an analytical counter-weight to the very extensive body of interpretation that has developed around HIV/AIDS.\n By analysing the total reporting on SARS of five major national newspapers during the epidemic of spring 2003, we investigate how the reporting of SARS in the UK press was framed, and how this related to media, public and governmental responses to the disease.\n We found that, surprisingly, militaristic language was largely absent, as was the judgemental discourse of plague.\n Rather, the main conceptual metaphor used was SARS as a killer.\n SARS as a killer was a single unified entity, not an army or force.\n We provide some tentative explanations for this shift in linguistic framing by relating it to local political concerns, media cultures, and spatial factors.\n","id":"PMC7117051","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Wallis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Brigitte","surname":"Nerlich","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

countries with declining numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, lockdown measures are gradually being lifted.\n\n However, even if most physical distancing measures are continued, other public health measures will be needed to control the epidemic.\n\n Contact tracing via conventional methods or mobile app technology is central to control strategies during de-escalation of physical distancing.\n\n We aimed to identify key factors for a contact tracing strategy to be successful.\n\n\nMethods\nWe evaluated the impact of timeliness and completeness in various steps of a contact tracing strategy using a stochastic mathematical model with explicit time delays between time of infection and symptom onset, and between symptom onset, diagnosis by testing, and isolation (testing delay).\n\n The model also includes tracing of close contacts (eg, household members) and casual contacts, followed by testing regardless of symptoms and isolation if testing positive, with different tracing delays and coverages.\n\n We computed effective reproduction numbers of a contact tracing strategy (RCTS) for a population with physical distancing measures and various scenarios for isolation of index cases and tracing and quarantine of their contacts.\n\n\nFindings\nFor the most optimistic scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days and tracing coverage of 100%), and assuming that around 40% of transmissions occur before symptom onset, the model predicts that the estimated effective reproduction number of 1·2 (with physical distancing only) will be reduced to 0·8 (95% CI 0·70·9) by adding contact tracing.\n\n The model also shows that a similar reduction can be achieved when testing and tracing coverage is reduced to 80% (RCTS 0·8, 95% CI 0·71·0).\n\n A testing delay of more than 1 day requires the tracing delay to be at most 1 day or tracing coverage to be at least 80% to keep RCTS below 1. With a testing delay of 3 days or longer, even the most efficient strategy cannot reach RCTS values below 1. The effect of minimising tracing delay (eg, with app-based technology) declines with decreasing coverage of app use, but app-based tracing alone remains more effective than conventional tracing alone even with 20% coverage, reducing the reproduction number by 17·6% compared with 2·5%.\n\n The proportion of onward transmissions per index case that can be prevented depends on testing and tracing delays, and given a 0-day tracing delay, ranges from up to 79·9% with a 0-day testing delay to 41·8% with a 3-day testing delay and 4·9% with a 7-day testing delay.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn our model, minimising testing delay had the largest impact on reducing onward transmissions.\n\n Optimising testing and tracing coverage and minimising tracing delays, for instance with app-based technology, further enhanced contact tracing effectiveness, with the potential to prevent up to 80% of all transmissions.\n\n Access to testing should therefore be optimised, and mobile app technology might reduce delays in the contact tracing process and optimise contact tracing coverage.\n\n\nFunding\nZonMw, Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, and EU Horizon 2020 RECOVER.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7365652","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mirjam E","surname":"Kretzschmar","email":"m.e.e.kretzschmar@umcutrecht.nl","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ganna","surname":"Rozhnova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Martin C J","surname":"Bootsma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michiel","surname":"van Boven","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Janneke H H M","surname":"van de Wijgert","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc J M","surname":"Bonten","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.7326/M20-0504","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Incubation Period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) From Publicly Reported Confirmed Cases: Estimation and Application","abstract":"Background:\nA novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019.

family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis

We used a counterfactual approach that first estimated the LRTI incidence, hospitalisations, and mortality and then attributed a fraction of those outcomes to influenza.\n\n\nFindings\nInfluenza LRTI was responsible for an estimated 145?000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 99?000200?000) deaths among all ages in 2017. The influenza LRTI mortality rate was highest among adults older than 70 years (16·4 deaths per 100?000 [95% UI 11·621·9]), and the highest rate among all ages was in eastern Europe (5·2 per 100?000 population [95% UI 3·57·2]).\n\n We estimated that influenza LRTIs accounted for 9?459?000 (95% UI 3?709?00022?935?000) hospitalisations due to LRTIs and 81?536?000 hospital days (24?330?000259?851?000).\n\n We estimated that 11·5% (95% UI 10·012·9) of LRTI episodes were attributable to influenza, corresponding to 54?481?000 (38?465?00073?864?000) episodes and 8?172?000 severe episodes (5?000?00013?296?000).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis comprehensive assessment of the burden of influenza LRTIs shows the substantial annual effect of influenza on global health.\n\n Although preparedness planning will be important for potential pandemics, health loss due to seasonal influenza LRTIs should not be overlooked, and vaccine use should be considered.\n\n Efforts to improve influenza prevention measures are needed.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates

variations in seasonality of laboratory-confirmed influenza and RSV epidemics in 137 global locations based on literature review and electronic sources.\n\n We assessed peak timing and epidemic duration and explored their association with geography and study settings.\n\n We fitted time series model to weekly national data available from the WHO influenza surveillance system (FluNet) to further characterize seasonal parameters.\n\n\nResults\nInfluenza and RSV activity consistently peaked during winter months in temperate locales, while there was greater diversity in the tropics.\n\n Several temperate locations experienced semi-annual influenza activity with peaks occurring in winter and summer.\n\n Semi-annual activity was relatively common in tropical areas of Southeast Asia for both viruses.\n\n Biennial cycles of RSV activity were identified in Northern Europe.\n\n Both viruses exhibited weak latitudinal gradients in the timing of epidemics by hemisphere, with peak timing occurring later in the calendar year with increasing latitude (P&lt;0.03).\n\n Time series model applied to influenza data from 85 countries confirmed the presence of latitudinal gradients in timing, duration, seasonal amplitude, and between-year variability of epidemics.\n\n Overall, 80% of tropical locations experienced distinct RSV seasons lasting 6 months or less, while the percentage was 50% for influenza.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur review combining literature and electronic data sources suggests that a large fraction of tropical locations experience focused seasons of respiratory virus activity in individual years.\n\n Information on seasonal patterns remains limited in large undersampled regions, included Africa and Central America.\n\n Future studies should attempt to link the observed latitudinal gradients in seasonality of viral epidemics with climatic and population factors, and explore regional differences in disease transmission dynamics and attack rates.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3573019","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kimberly","surname":"Bloom-Feshbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wladimir

Tropical Regions","abstract":"Background\nDespite the significant disease burden of the influenza virus in humans, our understanding of the basis for its pronounced seasonality remains incomplete.\n\n Past observations that influenza epidemics occur in the winter across temperate climates, combined with insufficient knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza in the tropics, led to the perception that cool and dry conditions were a necessary, and possibly sufficient, driver of influenza epidemics.\n\n Recent reports of substantial levels of influenza virus activity and well-defined seasonality in tropical regions, where warm and humid conditions often persist year-round, have rendered previous hypotheses insufficient for explaining global patterns of influenza.\n\n\nObjective\nIn this review, we examined the scientific evidence for the seasonal mechanisms that potentially explain the complex seasonal patterns of influenza disease activity observed globally.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this review we assessed the strength of a range of hypotheses that attempt to explain observations of influenza seasonality across different latitudes and how they relate to each other.\n\n We reviewed studies describing population-scale observations, mathematical models, and ecological, laboratory, and clinical experiments pertaining to influenza seasonality.\n\n The literature review includes studies that directly mention the topic of influenza seasonality, as well as other topics we believed to be relevant.\n\n We also developed an analytical framework that highlights the complex interactions among environmental stimuli, mediating mechanisms, and the seasonal timing of influenza epidemics and identify critical areas for further research.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe central questions in influenza seasonality remain unresolved.\n\n Future research is particularly needed in tropical localities, where our understanding of seasonality remains poor, and will require a combination of experimental and observational studies.\n\n Further understanding of the environmental factors that drive influenza circulation also may be useful to predict how dynamics will be affected at regional levels by global climate

epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

Virus Transmission Is Dependent on Relative Humidity and Temperature","abstract":"Using the guinea pig as a model host, we show that aerosol spread of influenza virus is dependent upon both ambient relative humidity and temperature.\n Twenty experiments performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission.\n The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding

depends on humidity.\n Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms by which humidity might influence transmissibility via the aerosol route have not been elucidated.\n We hypothesize that airborne concentrations of infectious influenza A viruses (IAVs) vary with humidity through its influence on virus inactivation rate and respiratory droplet size.\n To gain insight into the mechanisms by which humidity might influence aerosol transmission, we modeled the size distribution and dynamics of IAVs emitted from a cough in typical residential and public settings over a relative humidity (RH) range of 1090%.\n The model incorporates the size transformation of virus-containing droplets due to evaporation and then removal by gravitational settling, ventilation, and virus inactivation.\n The predicted concentration of infectious IAVs in air is 2.4 times higher at 10% RH than at 90% RH after 10 min in a residential setting, and this ratio grows over time.\n Settling is important for removal of large droplets containing large amounts of IAVs, while ventilation and inactivation are relatively more important for removal of IAVs associated with droplets &lt;5 µm.\n The inactivation rate increases linearly with RH; at the highest RH, inactivation can remove up to 28% of IAVs in 10 min.\n Humidity is an important variable in aerosol transmission of IAVs because it both induces droplet size transformation and affects IAV inactivation rates.\n Our model advances a mechanistic understanding of the aerosol transmission route, and results complement recent studies on the relationship between humidity and influenza's seasonality.\n Maintaining a high indoor RH and ventilation rate may help reduce chances of IAV infection.\n","id":"PMC3123350","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linsey

and delayed impacts of climate on dengue risk in Barbados: A modelling study","abstract":"Background\nOver the last 5 years (20132017), the Caribbean region has faced an unprecedented crisis of co-occurring epidemics of febrile illness due to arboviruses transmitted by the Aedes sp.\n\n mosquito (dengue, chikungunya, and Zika).\n\n Since 2013, the Caribbean island of Barbados has experienced 3 dengue outbreaks, 1 chikungunya outbreak, and 1 Zika fever outbreak.\n\n Prior studies have demonstrated that climate variability influences arbovirus transmission and vector population dynamics in the region, indicating the potential to develop public health interventions using climate information.\n\n The aim of this study is to quantify the nonlinear and delayed effects of climate indicators, such as drought and extreme rainfall, on dengue risk in Barbados from 1999 to 2016.\nMethods and findings\nDistributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) coupled with a hierarchal mixed-model framework were used to understand the exposurelagresponse association between dengue relative risk and key climate indicators, including the standardised precipitation index (SPI) and minimum temperature (Tmin).\n\n The model parameters were estimated in a Bayesian framework to produce probabilistic predictions of exceeding an island-specific outbreak threshold.\n\n The ability of the model to successfully detect outbreaks was assessed and compared to a baseline model, representative of standard dengue surveillance practice.\n\n Drought conditions were found to positively influence dengue relative risk at long lead times of up to 5 months, while excess rainfall increased the risk at shorter lead times between 1 and 2 months.\n\n The SPI averaged over a 6-month period (SPI-6), designed to monitor drought and extreme rainfall, better explained variations in dengue risk than monthly precipitation data measured in millimetres.\n\n Tmin was found to be a better predictor than mean and maximum temperature.\n\n Furthermore, including bidimensional exposurelagresponse functions of these indicatorsrather than linear effects for individual lagsmore appropriately described the climatedisease associations than traditional modelling approaches.\n\n In prediction mode, the model was successfully able to distinguish outbreaks from nonoutbreaks for most years, with an overall proportion of correct predictions (hits and correct rejections) of 86% (81%:91%) compared with 64% (58%:71%) for the baseline model.\n\n The ability of the model to predict dengue outbreaks in recent years was complicated by the lack of data on the emergence of new arboviruses, including chikungunya and Zika.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe present a modelling approach to infer the risk of dengue outbreaks given the cumulative effect of climate variations in the months leading up to an outbreak.\n\n By combining the dengue prediction model with climate indicators, which are routinely monitored and forecasted by the Regional Climate Centre (RCC) at the Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH), probabilistic dengue outlooks could be included in the Caribbean Health-Climatic Bulletin, issued on a quarterly basis to provide climate-smart decision-making guidance for Caribbean health practitioners.\n\n This flexible modelling approach could be extended to model the risk of dengue and other arboviruses in the Caribbean region.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6049902","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rachel","surname":"Lowe","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Gasparrini","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Gasparrini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cédric

this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza epidemiology and evolution.\n","id":"PMC2034399","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anice C","surname":"Lowen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samira","surname":"Mubareka","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Steel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Palese","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1518977113","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Differential and enhanced response to climate forcing in diarrheal disease due to rotavirus across a megacity of the developing world","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.puhe.2019.02.006","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Studying the influence of mass media and environmental factors on influenza virus transmission in the US Midwest","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1004591","date":"2014-11-25","title":"Environmental Drivers of the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Respiratory Syncytial Virus in the United States","abstract":"Epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are known to occur in wintertime in temperate countries including the United States, but there is a limited understanding of the importance of climatic drivers in determining the seasonality of RSV.\n In the United States, RSV activity is highly spatially structured, with seasonal peaks beginning in Florida in November through December and ending in the upper Midwest in February-March, and prolonged disease activity in the southeastern US.\n Using data on both age-specific hospitalizations and laboratory reports of RSV in the US, and employing a combination of statistical and mechanistic epidemic modeling, we examined the association between environmental variables and state-specific measures of RSV seasonality.\n Temperature, vapor pressure, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration (PET) were significantly associated with the timing of RSV activity across states in univariate exploratory analyses.\n The amplitude and timing of seasonality in the transmission rate was significantly correlated with seasonal fluctuations in PET, and negatively correlated with mean vapor pressure, minimum temperature, and precipitation.\n States with low mean vapor pressure and the largest seasonal variation in PET tended to experience biennial patterns of RSV activity, with alternating years of early-big and late-small epidemics.\n Our model for the transmission dynamics of RSV was able to replicate these biennial transitions at higher amplitudes of seasonality in the transmission rate.\n This successfully connects environmental drivers to the epidemic dynamics of RSV;

specific humidity conditions facilitate the airborne survival and transmission of the influenza virus in temperate regions, resulting in annual winter epidemics.\n However, this relationship is unlikely to account for the epidemiology of influenza in tropical and subtropical regions where epidemics often occur during the rainy season or transmit year-round without a well-defined season.\n We assessed the role of specific humidity and other local climatic variables on influenza virus seasonality by modeling epidemiological and climatic information from 78 study sites sampled globally.\n We substantiated that there are two types of environmental conditions associated with seasonal influenza epidemics: cold-dry and humid-rainy.\n For sites where monthly average specific humidity or temperature decreases below thresholds of approximately 1112 g/kg and 1821°C during the year, influenza activity peaks during the cold-dry season (i.\ne.\n, winter) when specific humidity and temperature are at minimal levels.\n For sites where specific humidity and temperature do not decrease below these thresholds, seasonal influenza activity is more likely to peak in months when average precipitation totals are maximal and greater than 150 mm per month.\n These findings provide a simple climate-based model rooted in empirical data that accounts for the diversity of seasonal influenza

and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","abstract":"Background\nSince Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak.\n\n Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 2324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·472·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·87·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227805), 113 (57193), 98 (49168), 111 (56191), and 80 (40139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 12 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong,

effect of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on the daily death counts of COVID-19.

However, both 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 death in lag 3 and lag 5, with the greatest decrease both in lag 3 [?7.50% (95% CI: ?10.99%,

estimated the incidence of RSV-associated ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality ratios with incidence estimates from hospital-based reports from published and unpublished studies and identifying studies with population-based data for RSV seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2005, an estimated 33·8 (95% CI 19·346·2) million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years (22% of ALRI episodes), with at least 3·4 (2·84·3) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission.\n\n We estimated that 66?000199?000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV-associated ALRI in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries.\n\n Incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year in any one setting.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGlobally, RSV is the most common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of admission to hospital as a result of severe ALRI.\n\n Mortality data suggest that RSV is an important cause of death in childhood from ALRI, after pneumococcal pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older

levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis

records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 89 and a 5-min Apgar score of 910. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.
