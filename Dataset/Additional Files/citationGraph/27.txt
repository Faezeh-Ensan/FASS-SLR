Three neonates were born prematurely.\n\n There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events.\n\n All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative.\n\n No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period.\n\n\nConclusions\nBoth epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive.\n\n Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7090434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bi-heng","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhong-yuan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                          Qing-tao","surname":"Meng","email":"mengqingtao2018@126.com","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30079-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

particularly during certain aerosol-generating medical procedures.\n We investigated a possible cluster of SARS-CoV infections in healthcare workers who used contact and droplet precautions during attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a SARS patient.\n Unlike previously reported instances of transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, the index case-patient was unresponsive, and the intubation procedure was performed quickly and without difficulty.\n However, before intubation, the patient was ventilated with a bag-valve-mask that may have contributed to aerosolization of SARS-CoV.\n On the basis of the results of this investigation and previous reports of SARS transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, a systematic approach to the problem is outlined, including the use of the following: 1) administrative controls, 2) environmental engineering controls, 3) personal protective equipment, and 4) quality

proposed and tested a new protocol for cardiac arrest in a patient with SARS.\n\n The protocol was rapidly and effectively instituted by teamwork training using high-fidelity simulation.\n\n\nMethods\nPhase 1 was a curriculum design of a SARS-specific cardiac arrest protocol in three steps: planning the new protocol, repeated simulations of this protocol in a classroom, and a subsequent simulation of a cardiac arrest on a hospital ward.\n\n Phase 2 was the training of 275 healthcare workers (HCWs) using the new protocol.\n\n Training involved a seminar, practice in wearing the mandatory personal protection system (PPS), and cardiac arrest simulations with subsequent debriefing.\n\n\nResults\nSimulation provided insights that had not been considered in earlier phases of development.\n\n For example, a single person can don a PPS worn for the SARS patient in 1 1/2 minutes.\n\n However, when multiple members of a cardiac arrest team were dressing simultaneously, the time to don the PPS increased to between 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 minutes.\n\n Errors in infection control as well as in medical management of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) were corrected.\n\n\nConclusion\nDuring the SARS crisis, real-time use of a high-fidelity simulator allowed the training of 275 HCWs in 2 weeks, with debriefing and error management.\n\n HCWs were required to manage the SARS cardiac arrest wearing unfamiliar equipment and following a modified ACLS protocol.\n\n The insight gained from this experience will be valuable for future infectious disease challenges in critical care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1550819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Simon

acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK.\n\n We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification.\n\n We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes.\n\n\nFindings\nA 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid.\n\n Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2?×?106 copies per mL).\n\n Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay).\n\n One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL).\n\n No virus was detected in blood.\n\n The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation.\n\n The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union; German Centre for Infection Research; German Research Council; and German Ministry for

coronavirus: estimation of pandemic risk","abstract":"Background\nThe new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection shares many clinical, epidemiological, and virological similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV.\n\n We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks.\n\n To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS.\n\n We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data.\n\n\nResults\nWith our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R0 to be 0·69 (95% CI 0·50–0·92); by contrast, the R0 for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 0·80 (0·54–1·13).\n\n Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R0 of 0·60 (0·42–0·80).\n\n Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient.\n\n Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R0 would exceed 1—ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential.\n\n We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.\n\n\nFunding\nAgence Nationale de la Recherche (Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases), and the European Community's

general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

Zika virus is a TORCH infection that produces a congenital malformation syndrome and pediatric neurodevelopmental abnormalities.\n Production of efficacious vaccines has been a public health priority for both infections.\n Unfortunately, during the clinical trials and subsequent deployment of a vaccine for the Ebola virus, pregnant and lactating women were, and continue to be, excluded from receiving the life-saving vaccine.\n The most serious consequence of Zika virus infection, congenital Zika syndrome, results from fetal infection during pregnancy.\n Thus, pregnant women have a major stake in the ongoing development of a vaccine for Zika virus.\n The exclusion of pregnant women from the development, clinical trials and administration of a potential Zika vaccine unfairly deprives them and their infants of the protection they need against this potentially catastrophic intrauterine infection.\n When creating policy about these issues, it is important to critically evaluate vaccine safety in pregnancy in the context of the substantial risk of infection for the pregnant woman and her fetus in the absence of immunization.\n","id":"PMC6313913","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Schwartz","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/vaccines8010038","date":"2020-01-19","title":"Being Pregnant during the Kivu Ebola Virus Outbreak in DR Congo: The rVSV-ZEBOV Vaccine and Its Accessibility by Mothers and Infants during Humanitarian Crises and in Conflict Areas","abstract":"The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that began in Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in July 2018 is the second largest in history.\n It is also the largest and most deadly of the ten Ebola outbreaks to occur in DRC, the country where Ebola was first identified during the 1976 Yambuku outbreak.\n The Kivu region is one of the most challenging locations in which to organize humanitarian assistance.\n It is an active conflict zone in which numerous armed groups are conducting violent acts, often directed against the inhabitants, healthcare and relief workers and peacekeepers.\n EVD has been especially problematic in pregnancy—previous outbreaks both in DRC and other countries have resulted in very high mortality rates among pregnant women and especially their infants, with maternal mortality in some outbreaks reaching over 90% and perinatal mortality 100%.\n The development and implementation of the Merck rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine for Ebola infection has been a tremendous public health advance in preventing EVD, being used successfully in both the West Africa Ebola epidemic and the Équateur DRC Ebola outbreak.\n But from the start of the Kivu outbreak, policy decisions had resulted in excluding pregnant and lactating women and their infants from receiving it during extensive ring vaccination efforts.\n In June 2019, this policy was reversed, 10 months after the start of the outbreak.\n Pregnant and lactating women are now permitted not only the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in the continuing Kivu outbreak but also the newly implemented Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN vaccine.\n","id":"PMC7157486","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Schwartz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s40475-019-00195-w","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Maternal and infant death and the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine through three recent Ebola virus epidemics-West Africa, DRC Equateur and DRC Kivu: 4 years of excluding pregnant and lactating women and their infants from immunization","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"CEPI to Fund Three Programmes to Develop Vaccines against the Novel Coronavirus, nCoV-2019. 23 January 2020","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A Dozen Vaccine Programs Underway as WHO Declares Coronavirus Public Health Emergency.

study","abstract":"Background\nSince June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has, worldwide, caused 104 infections in people including 49 deaths, with 82 cases and 41 deaths reported from Saudi Arabia.\n\n In addition to confirming diagnosis, we generated the MERS-CoV genomic sequences obtained directly from patient samples to provide important information on MERS-CoV transmission, evolution, and origin.\n\n\nMethods\nFull genome deep sequencing was done on nucleic acid extracted directly from PCR-confirmed clinical samples.\n\n Viral genomes were obtained from 21 MERS cases of which 13 had 100%, four 85–95%, and four 30–50% genome coverage.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 sequences, combined with nine published MERS-CoV genomes, was done.\n\n\nFindings\nThree distinct MERS-CoV genotypes were identified in Riyadh.\n\n Phylogeographic analyses suggest the MERS-CoV zoonotic reservoir is geographically disperse.\n\n Selection analysis of the MERS-CoV genomes reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the S protein.\n\n The genetic diversity in the Al-Hasa cluster suggests that the hospital outbreak might have had more than one virus introduction.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe present the largest number of MERS-CoV genomes (21) described so far.\n\n MERS-CoV full genome sequences provide greater detail in tracking transmission.\n\n Multiple introductions of MERS-CoV are identified and suggest lower R0 values.\n\n Transmission within Saudi Arabia is consistent with either movement of an animal reservoir, animal products, or movement of infected people.\n\n Further definition of the exposures responsible for the sporadic introductions of MERS-CoV into human populations is urgently needed.\n\n\nFunding\nSaudi Arabian Ministry of Health, Wellcome Trust, European Community, and National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research

different areas of China.\n However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV.\n Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China.\n The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei-Ping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Yi","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia-Zheng","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Zhi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong-Sheng","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Niang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.06882-11","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence for a common evolutionary origin of coronavirus spike protein receptor-binding subunits","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.1116480","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ff14SB: improving the accuracy of protein side chain and backbone parameters from ff99SB","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature12005","date":"2013-02-13","title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature12005) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7095326","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"V.

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 was determined by mapping the conditions listed in GBD 2017 to those listed in guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and the USA.\n\n We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity.\n\n To help interpretation of the degree of risk among those at increased risk, we also estimated the number of individuals at high risk (defined as those that would require hospital admission if infected) using age-specific infection–hospitalisation ratios for COVID-19 estimated for mainland China and making adjustments to reflect country-specific differences in the prevalence of underlying conditions and frailty.\n\n We assumed males were twice at likely as females to be at high risk.\n\n We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at increased risk because of their age, using minimum ages from 50 to 70 years.\n\n We generated uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates by running low and high scenarios using the lower and upper 95% confidence limits for country population size, disease prevalences, multimorbidity fractions, and infection–hospitalisation ratios, and plausible low and high estimates for the degree of clustering, informed by multimorbidity studies.\n\n\nFindings\nWe estimated that 1·7 billion (UI 1·0–2·4) people, comprising 22% (UI 15–28) of the global population, have at least one underlying condition that puts them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 if infected (ranging from &lt;5% of those younger than 20 years to &gt;66% of those aged 70 years or older).\n\n We estimated that 349 million (186–787) people (4% [3–9] of the global population) are at high risk of severe COVID-19 and would require hospital admission if infected (ranging from &lt;1% of those younger than 20 years to approximately 20% of those aged 70 years or older).\n\n We estimated 6% (3–12) of males to be at high risk compared with 3% (2–7) of females.\n\n The share of the population at increased risk was highest in countries with older populations, African countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence, and small island nations with high diabetes prevalence.\n\n Estimates of the number of individuals at increased risk were most sensitive to the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAbout one in five individuals worldwide could be at increased risk of severe COVID-19, should they become infected, due to underlying health conditions, but this risk varies considerably by age.\n\n Our estimates are uncertain, and focus on underlying conditions rather than other risk factors such as ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and obesity, but provide a starting point for considering the number of individuals that might need to be shielded or vaccinated as the global pandemic unfolds.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Department for International Development, Wellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Medical Research Council, and National Institute for

We explored reasons for hesitancy in qualitative data using a framework analysis.\n\n\nFindings\n11,584 HCWs were included in the cohort analysis.\n\n 23% (2704) reported vaccine hesitancy.\n\n Compared to White British HCWs (21.3% hesitant), HCWs from Black Caribbean (54.2%), Mixed White and Black Caribbean (38.1%), Black African (34.4%), Chinese (33.1%), Pakistani (30.4%), and White Other (28.7%) ethnic groups were significantly more likely to be hesitant.\n\n In adjusted analysis, Black Caribbean (aOR 3.37, 95% CI 2.11 - 5.37), Black African (aOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.49 - 2.82), White Other ethnic groups (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19 - 1.84) were significantly more likely to be hesitant.\n\n Other independent predictors of hesitancy were younger age, female sex, higher score on a COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs scale, lower trust in employer, lack of influenza vaccine uptake in the previous season, previous COVID-19, and pregnancy.\n\n Qualitative data from 99 participants identified the following contributors to hesitancy: lack of trust in government and employers, safety concerns due to the speed of vaccine development, lack of ethnic diversity in vaccine studies, and confusing and conflicting information.\n\n Participants felt uptake in ethnic minority communities might be improved through inclusive communication, involving HCWs in the vaccine rollout, and promoting vaccination through trusted networks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nDespite increased risk of COVID-19, HCWs from some ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant than their White British colleagues.\n\n Strategies to build trust and dispel myths surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine in these communities are urgently required.\n\n Emphasis should be placed on the safety and benefit of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnancy and in those with previous COVID-19.

This guide offers practical guidance for those who wish to apply the TDF to assess implementation problems and support intervention design.\n\n It presents a brief rationale for using a theoretical approach to investigate and address implementation problems, summarises the TDF and its development, and describes how to apply the TDF to achieve implementation objectives.\n\n Examples from the implementation research literature are presented to illustrate relevant methods and practical considerations.\n\n\nMethods\nResearchers from Canada, the UK and Australia attended a 3-day meeting in December 2012 to build an international collaboration among researchers and decision-makers interested in the advancing use of the TDF.\n\n The participants were experienced in using the TDF to assess implementation problems, design interventions, and/or understand change processes.\n\n This guide is an output of the meeting and also draws on the authors’ collective experience.\n\n Examples from the implementation research literature judged by authors to be representative of specific applications of the TDF are included in this guide.\n\n\nResults\nWe explain and illustrate methods, with a focus on qualitative approaches, for selecting and specifying target behaviours key to implementation, selecting the study design, deciding the sampling strategy, developing study materials,

and ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 adenoviral vector vaccines have been rapidly rolled out in the UK from December, 2020. We aimed to determine the factors associated with vaccine coverage for both vaccines and documented the vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a cohort of health-care workers undergoing regular asymptomatic testing.\n\n\nMethods\nThe SIREN study is a prospective cohort study among staff (aged ?18 years) working in publicly-funded hospitals in the UK.\n\n Participants were assigned into either the positive cohort (antibody positive or history of infection [indicated by previous positivity of antibody or PCR tests]) or the negative cohort (antibody negative with no previous positive test) at the beginning of the follow-up period.\n\n Baseline risk factors were collected at enrolment, symptom status was collected every 2 weeks, and vaccination status was collected through linkage to the National Immunisations Management System and questionnaires.\n\n Participants had fortnightly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and monthly antibody testing, and all tests (including symptomatic testing) outside SIREN were captured.\n\n Data cutoff for this analysis was Feb 5, 2021. The follow-up period was Dec 7, 2020, to Feb 5, 2021. The primary outcomes were vaccinated participants (binary ever vacinated variable; indicated by at least one vaccine dose recorded by at least one of the two vaccination data sources) for the vaccine coverage analysis and SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a PCR test for the vaccine effectiveness analysis.\n\n We did a mixed-effect logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with vaccine coverage.\n\n We used a piecewise exponential hazard mixed-effects model (shared frailty-type model) using a Poisson distribution to calculate hazard ratios to compare time-to-infection in unvaccinated and vaccinated participants and estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine on all PCR-positive infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic).\n\n This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN11041050, and is ongoing.\n\n\nFindings\n23?324 participants from 104 sites (all in England) met the inclusion criteria for this analysis and were enrolled.\n\n Included participants had a median age of 46·1 years (IQR 36·0–54·1) and 19?692 (84%) were female; 8203 (35%) were assigned to the positive cohort at the start of the analysis period, and 15?121 (65%) assigned to the negative cohort.\n\n Total follow-up time was 2 calendar months and 1?106?905 person-days (396?318 vaccinated and 710?587 unvaccinated).\n\n Vaccine coverage was 89% on Feb 5, 2021, 94% of whom had BNT162b2 vaccine.\n\n Significantly lower coverage was associated with previous infection, gender, age, ethnicity, job role, and Index of Multiple Deprivation score.\n\n During follow-up, there were 977 new infections in the unvaccinated cohort, an incidence density of 14 infections per 10?000 person-days; the vaccinated cohort had 71 new infections 21 days or more after their first dose (incidence density of eight infections per 10?000 person-days) and nine infections 7 days after the second dose (incidence density four infections per 10?000 person-days).\n\n In the unvaccinated cohort, 543 (56%) participants had typical COVID-19 symptoms and 140 (14%) were asymptomatic on or 14 days before their PCR positive test date, compared with 29 (36%) with typical COVID-19 symptoms and 15 (19%) asymptomatic in the vaccinated cohort.\n\n A single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine showed vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 55–85) 21 days after first dose and 85% (74–96) 7 days after two doses in the study population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings show that the BNT162b2 vaccine can prevent both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in working-age adults.\n\n This cohort was vaccinated when the dominant variant in circulation was B1.1.7 and shows effectiveness against this variant.\n\n\nFunding\nPublic Health England, UK Department of Health and Social Care, and the National Institute

thematic analysis.\n\n Multivariable logistic regression tested the association of demographic characteristics with vaccination unwillingness.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 911 respondents (response rate = 79.4%), 75.9% reported willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, 42.7% had unconditional willingness, and 33.3% were conditionally willing, of which the majority (80.7%) were willing if experts deemed vaccination safe and recommended.\n\n Preferred vaccine information sources were medical organizations (42.3%; CDC, WHO) and health care professionals (31.7%).\n\n Frequent concerns with vaccination included side effects (36.2%) and efficacy (20.1%).\n\n Race predicted vaccination unwillingness (Black: odds ratio = 3.31; and Asian: odds ratio = .\n\n46, compared with white, p &lt;

disruptions to social relationships and health services resulting from mitigation efforts instituted by public health authorities.\n\n This study examined the relationship between trust in the government and trust in COVID-19 health information from the US CDC, state health departments, and social media on the experience of COVID-19 social and health services-related disruptions.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>People living with HIV (N =?459) recruited through social media advertisements and chain referrals completed confidential surveys delivered through an online platform.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Participants experienced high-levels of disruptions to social relationships and health services attributable to COVID-19 mitigation efforts.\n\n We also observed high-rates of inaccurate information and low-levels of trust in government and sources of COVID-19 information.\n\n Greater disruptions to social relationships were predicted by more concern about

time, both decision-makers and the general population have high hopes for COVID-19 vaccination.\n Drawing from qualitative interview data collected in October 2020 as part of the pan-European SolPan study, this study explores early and anticipatory expectations, hopes and fears regarding COVID-19 vaccination across seven European countries.\n We find that stances towards COVID-19 vaccines were shaped by personal lived experiences, but participants also aligned personal and communal interests in their considerations.\n Trust, particularly in expert institutions, was an important prerequisite for vaccine acceptance, but participants also expressed doubts about the rapid vaccine development process.\n Our findings emphasise the need to move beyond the study of factors driving vaccine hesitancy, and instead to focus on how people personally perceive vaccination in their particular social and political

COVID-19: Implications for public health communications","abstract":"Background\nNegative attitudes towards vaccines and an uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations are major barriers to managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term.\n\n We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults.\n\n\nMethods\nData were cross-sectional and from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study.\n\n Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity.\n\n Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19.\nFindings\n16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust about vaccines across one or more domains.\n\n Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines.\n\n Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 23% were unsure.\n\n The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low-income groups (&lt; £16,000, a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children.\n\n Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of mistrust of vaccine benefit and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19.\nInterpretation\nNegative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern in the UK.\n\n General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination.\n\n Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns and specifically to women, ethnic minorities, and people with lower levels of education and incomes.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Nuffield Foundation [WEL/FR-000022583], the MARCH Mental

&lt;10 years in the UK) to the UK with precarious immigration status between September 2020 and March 2021, seeking their input into strategies to strengthen COVID-19 vaccine delivery and uptake.\n\n We used the ‘Three Cs’ model (confidence, complacency and convenience) to explore COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, barriers and access.\n\n Data were analysed using a thematic framework approach.\n\n Data collection continued until data saturation was reached, and no novel concepts were arising.\n\n The study was approved by the University of London ethics committee (REC 2020.00630).\n\n\nResults\nWe approached 20 migrant support groups nationwide, recruiting 32 migrants (mean age 37.1 years; 21 [66%] female; mean time in the UK 5.6 years [SD 3.7 years]), including refugees (n = 3), asylum seekers (n = 19), undocumented migrants (n = 8) and migrants with limited leave to remain (n = 2) from 15 different countries (5 WHO regions).\n\n 23 (72%) of 32 migrants reported being hesitant about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine and two (6%) would definitely not accept a vaccine.\n\n Participants communicated concerns over vaccine content, side-effects, lack of accessible information in an appropriate language, lack of trust in the health system and low perceived need.\n\n A range of barriers to accessing the COVID-19 vaccine were reported and concerns expressed that their communities would be excluded from or de-prioritised in the roll-out.\n\n Undocumented migrants described fears over being charged and facing immigration checks if they present for a vaccine.\n\n Participants (n = 10) interviewed after recent government announcements that COVID-19 vaccines can be accessed without facing immigration checks remained unaware of this.\n\n Participants stated that convenience of access would be a key factor in their decision around whether to accept a vaccine and proposed alternative access points to primary care services (for example, walk-in centres in trusted places such as foodbanks, community centres and charities), alongside promoting registration with primary care for all, and working closely with communities to produce accessible information on COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n\nConclusions\nPrecarious migrants may be hesitant about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine and face multiple and unique barriers to access, requiring simple but innovative solutions to ensure equitable access and uptake.\n\n Vaccine hesitancy and low awareness around entitlement and relevant access points could be easily addressed with clear, accessible, and tailored information campaigns, co-produced and delivered by trusted sources within marginalised migrant communities.\n\n These findings have immediate relevance to the COVID-19 vaccination initiatives in the UK and in other European and high-income countries with diverse migrant populations.\n\n\nFunding\nNIHR.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8154190","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Deal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sally E","surname":"Hayward","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mashal","surname":"Huda","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Felicity","surname":"Knights","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alison F","surname":"Crawshaw","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jessica","surname":"Carter","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Osama B","surname":"Hassan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yasmin","surname":"Farah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yusuf","surname":"Ciftci","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"May","surname":"Rowland-Pomp","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kieran","surname":"Rustage","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lucy","surname":"Goldsmith","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Monika","surname":"Hartmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sandra","surname":"Mounier-Jack","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rachel","surname":"Burns","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Miller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fatima","surname":"Wurie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ines","surname":"Campos-Matos","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Azeem","surname":"Majeed","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sally","surname":"Hargreaves","email":"s.hargreaves@sgul.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0246941","date":"2021-01-29","title":"Attitudes, current behaviours and barriers to public health measures that reduce COVID-19 transmission: A qualitative study to inform public health messaging","abstract":"Public health measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission include masking in public places, physical distancing, staying home when ill, avoiding high-risk locations, using a contact tracing app, and being willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine.\n However, adoption of these measures varies greatly.\n We aimed to improve health messaging to increase adherence to public health behaviours to reduce COVID-19 transmission by: 1) determining attitudes towards public health measures and current behaviours;

vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records","abstract":"Background\nPrevious studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and Technology Plan, Wuhan University Medical Development Plan.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159281","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Huijun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuechen","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiafu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dongchi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huixia","surname":"Yang","email":"yanghuixia@bjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Hou","email":"houwei@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuanzhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyuanzhen@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evolution of the novel coronavirus from the ongoing Wuhan outbreak and modeling of its spike protein for risk of human transmission","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Wuhan coronavirus has strong ability to infect humans","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effects of intrauterine exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids on fetal, newborn, and infant hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in humans: a systematic review","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Summary of probable SARS cases with onset of illness from 1 November 2002 to 31 July 2003","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of women with severe acute respiratory syndrome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy are limited to small case series.\n\n\nObjective\nTo evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes in pregnancy and the vertical transmission potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.\n\n\nStudy Design\nClinical records were retrospectively reviewed for 116 pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia from 25 hospitals in China between January 20, 2020, and March 24, 2020. Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal pharyngeal swab samples.\n\n\nResults\nThe median gestational age on admission was 38+0 (interquartile range, 36+0–39+1) weeks.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (50.9%, 59/116) and cough (28.4%, 33/116); 23.3% (27/116) patients presented without symptoms.\n\n Abnormal radiologic findings were found in 96.3% (104/108) of cases.\n\n Of the 116 cases, there were 8 cases (6.9%) of severe pneumonia but no maternal deaths.\n\n One of 8 patients who presented in the first trimester and early second trimester had a missed spontaneous abortion.\n\n Of 99 patients, 21 (21.2%) who delivered had preterm birth, including 6 with preterm premature rupture of membranes.\n\n The rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks’ gestation was 6.1% (6/99).\n\n One case of severe neonatal asphyxia resulted in neonatal death.\n\n Furthermore, 86 of the 100 neonates tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had negative results; of these, paired amniotic fluid and cord blood samples from 10 neonates used to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had negative results.\n\n\nConclusion\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and spontaneous preterm birth.\n\n There is no evidence of vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection when the infection manifests during the third trimester of pregnancy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7177142","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cuifang","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juan","surname":"Juan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuechen","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiafu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chunyan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huijun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Qiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Di","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoping","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengyi","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wencong","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qiumei","surname":"Pang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoling","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Suqing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dunjin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuanzhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liona C.","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                          Huixia","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30154-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was

delivered in the acute stage of SARS, there were increases in intervillous or subchorionic fibrin which might be related to disturbances in maternal placental blood flow due to the hypoxic respiratory

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak.\n The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV.\n Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus.\n Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV.\n In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients.\n

retrospective review of medical records","abstract":"Background\nPrevious studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and Technology Plan, Wuhan University Medical Development Plan.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159281","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Huijun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuechen","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiafu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dongchi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huixia","surname":"Yang","email":"yanghuixia@bjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Hou","email":"houwei@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuanzhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyuanzhen@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JCM.00941-20","date":"2020-05-06","title":"Performance
