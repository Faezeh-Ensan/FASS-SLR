study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention.\n On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern.\n The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century.\n As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO.\n Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to ?-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host.\n The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract.\n Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe.\n The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms.\n The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm.\n Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.\n In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.\n","id":"PMC7068984","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan-Rong","surname":"Guo","email":"guoyr5@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qing-Dong","surname":"Cao","email":"Cqd8866@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong-Si","surname":"Hong","email":"hongzhs@mail.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yang","surname":"Tan","email":"tanyy29@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shou-Deng","surname":"Chen","email":"chenshd5@mail.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong-Jun","surname":"Jin","email":"jinhj3@mail.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kai-Sen","surname":"Tan","email":"enttks@nus.edu.sg","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"De-Yun","surname":"Wang","email":"entwdy@nus.edu.sg","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Yan","email":"yanyan35@mail.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tissue

Twenty-three healthy subjects received nasal LTB4 in a randomized and sham-controlled design.\n\n Symptoms were scored and nasal lavages carried out.\n\n Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and ?-defensins were monitored as indices of neutrophil activity.\n\n IL-8, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and ?2-macroglobulin were measured as indices of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, eosinophil activity, and plasma exudation.\n\n 2. Supernatants from neutrophils activated by LTB4 in vitro were assayed for virucidal activity against respiratory viruses.\n\n 3. In 38 healthy individuals, nasal inoculation with human rhinovirus-16 (HRV-16) was performed.\n\n In a preliminary study, intervention with LTB4 was given in a randomized and controlled design.\n\n Symptoms, virus replication, and antibody-titres were monitored.\n\n\nResults\n1. LTB4 produced statistically significant increases in MPO and ?-defensins, whereas IL-8, ECP, and ?2-macroglobulin were unaffected.\n\n 2. The supernatants efficiently killed human coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza B virus.\n\n 3. HRV-16 replication was lower in subjects receiving LTB4, but this difference failed to reach statistical significance.\n\n Common cold symptoms and incidence of seroconversion were unaffected.\n\n\nConclusion\nNasal LTB4 induces a selective recruitment/activation of neutrophils.\n\n LTB4 can condition neutrophils to exert virucidal effects in vitro and may reduce virus

China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

and outcome of oral squamous cell carcinoma: Evidence from cohort studies and functional analyses","abstract":"Background\nPA28? was suggested to play a role in malignant progression.\n\n This paper aimed to investigate the association between PA28? and the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in cohort studies.\n\n\nMethods\nThe PA28? expression level was assessed by immunohistochemistry in a total of 368 OSCC patients from three independent cohorts.\n\n The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine multivariate hazard ratios for Overall Survival (OS).\n\n Model discrimination was measured using C Statistic.\n\n Additionally, OS was analyzed in Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set.\n\n Functional analyses were conducted both in-vitro and in-vivo.\n\n\nFindings\nThe median follow-up times of patients in the three studies were 60, 52, and 51 months.\n\n High expression of PA28? was identified in tumors from 179 of 368 patients (48.6%).\n\n Compared with low expression, high expression of PA28? was strongly associated with worse OS, with relative risks of 5.14 (95% CI, 2.51–10.5; P &lt; 0.001), 2.82 (95% CI, 1.73–4.61; P &lt; 0.001), and 3.85 (95% CI, 1.59–9.37; P = 0.003).\n\n PA28? expression was also associated with disease-free survival in all three cohorts (P &lt; 0.005).\n\n These findings are consistent with TCGA HNSCC data (P &lt; 0.006).\n\n The prediction of all-cause mortality was significantly improved when PA28? was added to the traditional clinical factors (Model 3, C statistic value: 0.78 VS 0.73, P = 0.016).\n\n In functional analyses, we found that PA28? silencing dramatically inhibited the growth, proliferation and mobility of OSCC cells in vitro and reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis in tumor-bearing mice.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPA28? overexpression is associated with adverse prognosis in patients with OSCC.\n\n The aberrant expression of PA28? may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of OSCC.\n\n\nResearch in context\nOSCC is one of the most common HNSCC, which have a high lethally rate.\n\n However, few prognostic markers have been applied in the clinical practice.\n\n We found that PA28? in OSCC tumor tissues were significantly high expression than those in normal tissues.\n\n As the results of the three cohorts from two independent research centers and from an additional validation cohort from a US population in the TCGA dataset, we demonstrate PA28? is a good predictor of the risk of death in OSCC.\n\n Meanwhile, we demonstrate PA28? have a potential role in OSCC tumorigenesis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4563126","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaodong","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chongkun","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Zeng","email":"zengxin22@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hao","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Taiwen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruinan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xikun","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongxia","surname":"Dan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Ji","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ga","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dunfang","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yunfeng","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xinhua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Longjiang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhi","surname":"Wang","email":"wangzhi0506@vip.163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qianming","surname":"Chen","email":"qmchen@scu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ejca.2008.11.012","date":"1970-01-01","title":"RACK1, an excellent predictor for poor clinical outcome in oral squamous carcinoma, similar to Ki67","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Forrest, A.

The Sniffin-Sticks test and the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center orthonasal olfaction test were used to objectively evaluate the olfactory function.\n Results: This study included 774 patients, of these 481 (62.1%) presented olfactory dysfunction (OD): 280 were hyposmic and 201 were anosmic.\n There was a significant difference between self-reported anosmia/hyposmia and psychophysical test results (p = 0.006).\n Patients with gastroesophageal disorders reported a significantly higher probability of presenting hyposmia (OR 1.86; p = 0.015) and anosmia (OR 2.425; p &lt; 0.001).\n Fever, chest pain, and phlegm significantly increased the likelihood of having hyposmia but not anosmia or an olfactory disturbance.\n In contrast, patients with dyspnea, dysphonia, and severe-to-critical COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have no anosmia, while these symptoms had no effect on the risk of developing hyposmia or an OD.\n Conclusions: Psychophysical assessment represents a significantly more accurate assessment tool for olfactory function than patient self-reported clinical outcomes.\n Olfactory disturbances appear to be largely independent from the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the patients.\n The non-association with rhinitis symptoms and the high prevalence as a presenting symptom make olfactory disturbances an important symptom in the differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and common flu.\n","id":"PMC7827350","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Luigi

sources\nPubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and medRxiv from inception to 3 October 2021.\nReview methods\nTwo blinded reviewers selected observational studies of adults (?18 years) with

extraction and synthesis\nTwo reviewers extracted data, evaluated study bias using QUIPS, and appraised evidence quality using GRADE, following PRISMA and MOOSE reporting guidelines.\n\n Using iterative numerical algorithms, time-to-event individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed and pooled to retrieve distribution-free summary survival curves, with recovery rates reported at 30 day intervals for participants who remained alive.\n\n To estimate the proportion with persistent smell and taste dysfunction, cure fractions from Weibull non-mixture cure models of plateaued survival curves were logit transformed and pooled in a two stage meta-analysis.\n\n Conventional aggregate data meta-analysis was performed to explore unadjusted associations of prognostic factors with recovery.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nThe primary outcomes were the proportions of patients remaining with smell or taste dysfunction.\n\n Secondary outcomes were the odds ratios of prognostic variables associated with recovery of smell and taste.\n\n\nResults\n18 studies (3699 patients) from 4180 records were included in reconstructed IPD meta-analyses.\n\n Risk of bias was low to moderate; conclusions remained unaltered after exclusion of four high risk studies.\n\n Evidence quality was moderate to high.\n\n Based on parametric cure modelling, persistent self-reported smell

syndrome?coronavirus?2 (SARS?CoV?2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19), is responsible for the largest pandemic since the 1918 influenza A virus subtype H1N1 influenza outbreak.\n\n The symptoms presently recognized by the World Health Organization are cough, fever, tiredness, and difficulty breathing.\n\n Patient?reported smell and taste loss has been associated with COVID?19 infection, yet no empirical olfactory testing on a cohort of COVID?19 patients has been performed.\n\n\nMethods\nThe University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a well?validated 40?odorant test, was administered to 60 confirmed COVID?19 inpatients and 60 age? and sex?matched controls to assess the magnitude and frequency of their olfactory dysfunction.\n\n A mixed effects analysis of variance determined whether meaningful differences in test scores existed between the 2 groups and if the test scores were differentially influenced by sex.\n\n\nResults\nFifty?nine (98%) of the 60 patients exhibited some smell dysfunction (mean [95% CI] UPSIT score: 20.98 [19.47, 22.48]; controls: 34.10 [33.31, 34.88]; p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Thirty?five of the 60 patients (58%) were either anosmic (15/60; 25%) or severely microsmic (20/60; 33%); 16 exhibited moderate microsmia (16/60; 27%), 8 mild microsmia (8/60; 13%), and 1 normosmia (1/60; 2%).\n\n Deficits were evident for all 40 UPSIT odorants.\n\n No meaningful relationships between the test scores and sex, disease severity, or comorbidities were found.\n\n\nConclusion\nQuantitative smell testing demonstrates that decreased smell function, but not always anosmia, is a major marker for SARS?CoV?2 infection and suggests the possibility that smell testing may help, in some cases, to identify COVID?19 patients in need of early treatment or quarantine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7262123","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shima T.","surname":"Moein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Seyed

(OD), assessed with psychophysical tests, and the viral load on the rhino?pharyngeal swab determined with a direct method, in patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19).\n\n\nStudy design\nProspective cohort study.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients underwent psychophysical olfactory assessment with Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center test and determination of the normalized viral load on nasopharyngeal swab within 10?days of the clinical onset of COVID?19.\nResults\nSixty COVID?19 patients were included in this study.\n\n On psychophysical testing, 12 patients (20% of the cohort) presented with anosmia, 11 (18.3%) severe hyposmia, 13 (18.3%) moderate hyposmia, and 10 (16.7%) mild hyposmia with an overall prevalence of OD of 76.7%.\n\n The overall median olfactory score was 50 (interquartile range [IQR] 30–72.5) with no significant differences between clinical severity subgroups.\n\n The median normalized viral load detected in the series was 2.56E+06 viral copies/106 copies of human beta?2microglobulin mRNA present in the sample (IQR 3.17E+04–1.58E+07) without any significant correlations with COVID?19 severity.\n\n The correlation between viral load

The mean body mass index of the patients was 25.54 ± 4.63 Kg/m2.\n\n The majority of patients had, at least, one comorbidity and among 75% symptomatic patients, about 50% had, at least, three symptoms namely, fever (40.7%), cough (39.8%), myalgia (28.7%), and anosmia and/or ageusia (20.4%).\n\n From biological analyzes, we noticed lymphopenia and an elevated protein C reactive and lactate

SARS-CoV-2 appears equally, or even more, infectious for the olfactory epithelium (OE) than for the respiratory epithelium in the nasal cavity.\n In light of the small area of the OE relative to the respiratory epithelium, the high prevalence of olfactory dysfunctions (ODs) in COVID-19 has been bewildering and has attracted much attention.\n This review aims to first examine the cytological and molecular biological characteristics of the OE, especially the microvillous apical surfaces of sustentacular cells and the abundant SARS-CoV-2 receptor molecules thereof, that may underlie the high susceptibility of this neuroepithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection and damages.\n The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, or the lack of it, is then analyzed with regard to the expression of the receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) or priming protease (transmembrane serine protease 2), and cellular targets of infection.\n Neuropathology of COVID-19 in the OE, olfactory bulb, and other related neural structures are also reviewed.\n Toward the end, we present our perspectives regarding possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis and ODs, in the absence of substantial viral infection of neurons.\n Plausible causes for persistent ODs in some COVID-19 convalescents are also

or nasal corticosteroids (NC) as an add-on to olfactory training (OT) versus OT alone in patients with olfactory dysfunction (OD) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n Methods: Patients with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 and OD were prospectively recruited from March 22 to December 15, 2020 from 4 European hospitals.\n Patients had confirmed OD on psychophysical testing.\n All patients undertook OT, with add-on 10 days of OC (group 1: OC + OT), or 1 month of NC (group 2: NC + OT) or olfactory training alone (group 3: OT).\n Olfactory evaluations (Sniffin’Sticks tests) were carried out at the time of inclusion, 1 and 2 months after the start of the therapeutic course.\n Results: A total of 152 hyposmic or anosmic patients completed the study.\n Group 1, 2 and 3 included 59, 22 and 71 patients, respectively and all patient groups were comparable regarding baseline Sniffin’Sticks tests.\n The median Sniffin’Sticks test values significantly improved from pre- to post-intervention in all groups.\n The increase of Sniffin’Sticks test values was higher in group 1 (OC + OT) compared with groups 2 and 3 (p &lt; 0.001) at one month after treatment but did not remain so at 2 months.\n Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, presented parosmia in 20/71 (28.2%), 9/22 (40.9%) and 42/71 (59.2%) patients.\n This difference was statistically significant between group 1 and 3 (p &lt; 0.001).\n There were no patients with a worsening of the disease or an increase of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms.\n Conclusions: The use of OCs in patients with OD related to mild COVID-19 is generally well-tolerated without any case of deterioration of symptoms.\n OC is associated with greater improvement in psychophysical olfactory evaluations at 1-month post-treatment but there was no difference at 2 months.\n Parosmia may be reduced following treatment with OC and NC.\n On the basis of these preliminary results, it is possible to state that considering the 2 months efficacy of OC and NC with respect to the OT alone and the risk-benefit ratio, the benefit to start a specific treatment of COVID-19 related OD cannot be demonstrated and there is a need for a

Aims: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR?) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of using GD as a triage symptom prior to RT-PCR.\n Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched up to 20 June 2021.

manuscript, we report the cross-sectional data (first assessment) of a longitudinal study (6-month follow-up) examining smell, taste, and chemesthesis in participants affected by long-term COVID-19 (COVID+) and participants without COVID-19 (COVID?) by means of both self-reported and direct psychophysical methods.\n In total, 208 Italian participants (COVID+ n = 133; COVID? n = 75) completed the Smell and Taste Check developed by the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research (GCCR), which includes self-reports on smell, taste, and chemesthetic abilities as well as direct intensity ratings of unstandardized smell, taste, and chemesthetic household items.\n Furthermore, all participants completed SCENTinel, a validated direct smell test.\n We found a positive association between the self-reported, unstandardized direct test and the validated direct test for smell, indicating moderate to large agreement across measures.\n Furthermore, the performance on SCENTinel was significantly associated with self-reported smell loss.\n A positive association between the self-reports and the intensity of household items was also retrieved for taste and chemesthesis.\n The time relative to COVID-19 onset (267.3 ± 113.9 days) did not modulate the chemosensory performance of self-reported abilities, intensity ratings, and SCENTinel.\n All in all, we confirm the impairment of three

disorders (OD) in COVID-19 are limited.\n Method.\n ANOSVID is a retrospective study in Nord Franche-Comté Hospital (France) that included COVID-19 patients from the first wave.\n The aim was to describe OD evolution, especially in patients with persistent OD (p-OD group) in comparison with patients with resolved OD (r-OD group).\n Results.\n Among 354 COVID-19 patients, 229 reported OD were included.\n Eighty-five percent of patients (n = 195) recovered from their OD within 90 days.\n However, 9.5 months (in average) after symptoms onset, OD were persisting in 93 patients (40.6%) and resolved in 136 patients (59.4%).\n In the p-OD group (n = 93), the mean age was 51.4 years (19–98) ± 20.2, and 65 patients (69.9%) were female; the three main comorbidities in the p-OD group were: asthma (20.4%, n = 19), allergic rhinitis (19.4%, n = 18), and arterial hypertension (16.1%, n = 15).\n Eleven patients (12%) presented anosmia, and 82 patients (88%) presented hyposmia.\n Asthma was more described in p-OD group than r-OD group (19 (20.4%) versus 10 (7.4%), p = 0.006).\n Cacosmia was more described in p-OD group than r-OD group (27 (29.0%) versus 18 (13.2%), p = 0.005).\n There was no significant difference between the two groups concerning other comorbidities and symptoms, clinical, biological, and imaging findings, and outcome or about the impact of OD on the quality of life of the patients between the p-OD group and r-OD group.\n sQOD-NS brief version score was 10.7 ± 5.89 and 12.0 ± 6.03, respectively (p = 0.137).\n Conclusion.\n Forty-one percent of patients with OD reported OD persistence 9.5 months after COVID-19 (hyposmia in 88% of cases).\n Asthma and cacosmia could be predictive factors of OD

Different therapeutic options, including mometasone nasal spray, have been recommended, only some of which have been validated for post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction.\n In this study we psychophysically assessed the effect of intranasally applied mometasone furoate on the recovery of olfaction.\n The spray was applied with a long applicator so that the olfactory cleft could be reached effectively.\n After olfactory dysfunction had been confirmed psychophysically using Sniffin’ Sticks, patients were randomly assigned to two different treatment arms: the study group (n = 40) underwent olfactory training and intranasal administration of mometasone furoate twice daily, whereas the control group (n = 46) performed olfactory training only.\n After a study duration of three months, psychophysical testing of olfaction was repeated using Sniffin’ Sticks.\n We found no benefit of an additional topical administration of mometasone furoate compared to olfactory training alone.\n These results psychophysically confirm two previous studies which were based on patients’ subjective self-ratings.\n Our findings are in contrast to current recommendations for the management of olfactory dysfunction post-COVID-19, which might have to be adapted accordingly.\n","id":"PMC9605508","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Constantin

All patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020.\nResults\nThe median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients (46%) were men.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]), cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]).\n\n Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients).\n\n As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%.\n\n According to the lowest SpO2 during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2?90% group (n=55) and the SpO2&lt;90% group (n=14).\n\n All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2&lt;90% group.\n\n Compared with SpO2?90% group, patients of the SpO2&lt;90% group were older, and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c reactive protein.\n\n Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate.\n\n\nConclusions\nCOVID-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5%.\n\n Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184452","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhongliang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bohan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianwen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Wen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiguang","surname":"Zhang","email":"zrg27@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19):China, 2020","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Smell and taste disorders","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The olfactory nerve: a shortcut for influenza and other viral diseases into the central nervous system","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection causes neuronal death in the absence of encephalitis in mice transgenic for human ACE2","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"High expression of ACE2 receptor of 2019-nCoV on the epithelial cells of oral mucosa","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Development of the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test: a standardized microencapsulated test of olfactory function","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.03.23.20041889","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coincidence of COVID-19 epidemic and olfactory dysfunction outbreak","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Position paper on olfactory dysfunction","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Re-establishment of olfactory and taste functions","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Smell and taste disorders","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Biopsies of human olfactory epithelium","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":" World Health Organization.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS?CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS?CoV?2 (previously known as 2019?nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world.\n This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS?CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS?CoV and MERS?CoV.\n The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID?19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously.\n Additionally, some patients with COVID?19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases.\n The infection of SARS?CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected.\n Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse?connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways.\n Considering the high similarity between SARS?CoV and SARS?CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS?CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID?19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS?CoV?2?induced respiratory failure.\n","id":"PMC7228394","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan?Chao","surname":"Li","email":"liyanchao@jlu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tsutomu","surname":"Hashikawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.22.20026500","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Neurological manifestations of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective case series study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.3786","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in different types of clinical specimens","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

consensus we described five clinical patterns.\n\n We later described the association of these patterns with patient demographics, the timing in relation to symptoms of the disease, the severity and the prognosis.\n\n\nResults\nThe lesions may be classified as acral areas of erythema with vesicles or pustules (pseudo?chilblain) (19%), other vesicular eruptions (9%), urticarial lesions (19%), maculopapular eruptions (47%) and livedo or necrosis (6%).\n\n Vesicular eruptions appear early in the course of the disease (15% before other symptoms).\n\n The pseudo?chilblain pattern frequently appears late in the evolution of the COVID?19 disease (59% after other symptoms), while the rest tend to appear with other symptoms of COVID?19.

unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaolin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xingwang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuelei","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangfa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongmeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Wang","email":"wangjw28@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"caobin_ben@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

weeks.\n A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative.\n Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected.\n There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected.\n The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend.\n If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30?000 infected patients.\n Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks.\n If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3–4 days, departing from the exponential trend.\n However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.\n","id":"PMC7102589","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Andrea","surname":"Remuzzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Remuzzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/jmv.25721","date":"2020-02-22","title":"Combination of RT?qPCR testing and clinical features for diagnosis of COVID?19 facilitates management of SARS?CoV?2 outbreak","abstract":"","id":"PMC7233289","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yishan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hanyujie","surname":"Kang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuefeng","surname":"Liu","email":"xuefeng.liu@georgetown.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhaohui","surname":"Tong","email":"tongzhaohuicy@sina.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhaohui","surname":"Tong","email":"tongzhaohuicy@sina.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/RLI.0000000000000670","date":"2020-02-19","title":"Chest CT Findings in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Its Relationship With Clinical Features","abstract":"Objectives\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate its relationship with clinical features.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy sample consisted of 80 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 from January to February 2020.

Females Contribute to Sex-Related Differences in the Innate Immune Response","abstract":"Females have a longer lifespan and better general health than males.\n Considerable number of studies also demonstrated that, after trauma and sepsis, females present better outcomes as compared to males indicating sex-related differences in the innate immune response.\n The current notion is that differences in the immuno-modulatory effects of sex hormones are the underlying causative mechanism.\n However, the field remains controversial and the exclusive role of sex hormones has been challenged.\n Here, we propose that polymorphic X-linked immune competent genes, which are abundant in the population are important players in sex-based immuno-modulation and play a key role in causing sex-related outcome differences following trauma or sepsis.\n We describe the differences in X chromosome (ChrX) regulation between males and females and its consequences in the context of common X-linked polymorphisms at the individual as well as population level.\n We also discuss the potential pathophysiological and immune-modulatory aspects of ChrX cellular mosaicism, which is unique to females and how this may contribute to sex-biased immune-modulation.\n The potential confounding effects of ChrX skewing of cell progenitors at the bone marrow is also presented together with aspects of acute trauma-induced de novo ChrX skewing at the periphery.\n In support of the hypothesis, novel observations indicating ChrX skewing in a female trauma cohort as well as case studies depicting the temporal relationship between trauma-induced cellular skewing and the clinical course are also described.\n Finally, we list and discuss a selected set of polymorphic X-linked genes, which are frequent in the population and have key regulatory or metabolic functions in the innate immune response and, therefore, are primary candidates for mediating sex-biased immune responses.\n We conclude that sex-related differences in a variety of disease processes including the innate inflammatory response to injury and infection may be related to the abundance of X-linked polymorphic immune-competent genes, differences in ChrX regulation, and inheritance patterns between the sexes and the presence of X-linked cellular mosaicism, which is unique to females.\n","id":"PMC5694032","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zoltan","surname":"Spolarics","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Geber","surname":"Peña","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert

stimulation in prepubescent children","abstract":"Background\nGender influences clinical presentations and markers in inflammatory diseases.\n\n In many chronic conditions, frequency of complications is greater in females, suggesting that continuous inflammatory reaction may induce greater damage in targeted organs and functions.\n\n\nMethods\nTo investigate gender dimorphism at a cellular level, we evaluated the production of cytokines implicated in inflammatory processes (IL -1, IL- 6, PGE-2 and TNF alpha), in healthy prepubescent children of both sex and Turner's syndrome (TS) patients (genotype XO).\n\n We used stimulation by LPS (0.2 and 1 ng/ml) and Pokeweed Mitogen (PWM) on overnight cultures from whole blood samples, collected in 57 subjects: 22 girls/26 boys (5-96 months), and 9 TS patients (6-15 years).\n\n The primary outcome was to evaluate if gender influences the production of cytokines, with potential relation to X chromosome monosomy.\n\n Secondary endpoints were to relate different cytokines level productions and conditions.\n\n\nResults\nWe confirm the male over female increased cytokine productions already observed in adults.\n\n This is contrasting with numerous observations obtained in vivo about increased production of inflammatory markers in females (CRP, ESR and neutrophil counts), as we recently reported in children.\n\n Relative variations of the dimorphism according to stimulus, its concentration and cytokine type are discussed, presenting IL6 with a modulating function that could be more potent in males.\n\n TS subjects follow mostly the male pattern of reactivity, sustaining the role of some gene expression differing with X chromosome monosomy and disomy.\n\n\nConclusions\nPersistence of the latter dimorphism throughout life casts doubts on its direct relationship with individual hormonal status, as already documented by others in vitro, and supports the need for alternative hypothesis, such as the influence of X chromosome gene products escaping X inactivation in females and absent in subjects with X monosomy (males, TS).\n\n\n","id":"PMC2890631","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Georges

small for gestational (SGA) infants and appropriate (AGA) healthier counterparts.\n\n\nDesign\nA hospital based prospective observational study was performed at a perinatal center.\n\n Echocardiograms were performed on the first postnatal day and again at 48?h age.\n\n Term SGA infants were compared with those AGA newborns matched for the GA and mode of delivery.\n\n\nResults\nEighteen SGA infants were compared with 18 AGA infants [gestation 38?±?1.5 vs.\n\n 38?±?1.2 weeks, p?&gt;?0.05 and birthweight 2331?±?345 vs.\n\n 3332?±?405 grams, p?&lt;?0.05, respectively].\n\n Maternal weight and body mass index was higher among non-affected pregnancies, 61% infants were born vaginally, and no differences in cord blood pH at birth were noted.\n\n SGA infants had higher systolic and mean blood pressure at both time points, lower indices of right ventricular (RV) performance [TAPSE (tricuspid annular peak systolic excursion) 7.4?±?2.8 vs.\n\n 9.3?±?0.7 on day 1, 7.2?±?2.8 vs.\n\n 9.2?±?0.5 on day 2, p?=?0.001], lower pulmonary acceleration time (PAAT) suggestive of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance [56.4?±?10.5 vs.\n\n 65.7?±?13.2 on day 1, 61.4?±?12.5 vs.\n\n 71.5?±?15.7 on day 2, p?=?0.01] and higher left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction [62.1?±?7.8 vs.\n\n 54.9?±?5.5 on day 1, 61.9?±?7.6 vs.\n\n 55.8?±?4.9 on day 2, p?=?0.003].\n\n\nConclusions\nSGA infants had evidence of higher pulmonary vascular resistance, and lower RV performance during the postnatal transition.\n\n The relevance and impact of these changes to hemodynamic disease states during the postnatal transition requires prospective investigation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9884809","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura
