Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients of ?18 years; 2) patients who were pregnant; 3) length of ICU stay of ?24 h; 4) insufficient medical information available.\n\n Patients' characteristics and clinical information were obtained from electronic medical and nursing records.\n\n The nutritional risk for each patient was assessed at their ICU admission using the mNUTRIC score.\n\n A score of ?5 indicated high nutritional risk.\n\n Mortality was calculated according to patients’ outcomes following 28 days of hospitalization in ICU.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 136 critically ill COVID-19 patients with a median age of 69 years (IQR: 57–77), 86 (63%) males and 50 (37%) females, were included in the study.\n\n Based on the mNUTRIC score at ICU admission, a high nutritional risk (?5 points) was observed in 61% of the critically ill COVID-19 patients, while a low nutritional risk (&lt;5 points) was observed in 39%.\n\n The mortality of ICU 28-day was significantly higher in the high nutritional risk group than in the low nutritional risk group (87% vs 49%, P ?0.001).\n\n Patients in the high nutritional risk group exhibited significantly higher incidences of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, secondary infection, shock and use of vasopressors.\n\n Additionally, use of a multivariate Cox analysis showed that patients with high nutritional risk had a higher probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk (adjusted HR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22–3.32, P = 0.006).\n\n\nConclusions\nA large proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients had a high nutritional risk, as revealed by their mNUTRIC score.\n\n Patients with high nutritional risk at ICU admission exhibited significantly higher mortality of ICU 28-day, as well as twice the probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk.\n\n Therefore, the mNUTRIC score may be an appropriate tool for nutritional risk assessment and prognosis prediction for critically ill COVID-19 patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7273137","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Zhigang","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yikuan","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianmin","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shusheng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"                            Yi","surname":"Bian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30154-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included

molecular biology which can aid in the production of effective anti-coronaviral agents for both human CoVs and enzootic CoVs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6537279","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dewald","surname":"Schoeman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Burtram

2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China.\n Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization.\n We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes.\n Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV.\n The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses.\n However, the external subdomain of Spike’s receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses.\n Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein.\n Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.\n Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for

cellular functions.\n When overwhelming the antioxidant defense system, the excess of ROS induces oxidative stress.\n Viral infections lead to diseases characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms, with oxidative stress being one of their hallmarks.\n In many cases, ROS can, in turn, enhance viral replication leading to an amplification loop.\n Another important parameter for viral replication and pathogenicity is the nutritional status of the host.\n Viral infection simultaneously increases the demand for micronutrients and causes their loss, which leads to a deficiency that can be compensated by micronutrient supplementation.\n Among the nutrients implicated in viral infection, selenium (Se) has an important role in antioxidant defense, redox signaling and redox homeostasis.\n Most of biological activities of selenium is performed through its incorporation as a rare amino acid selenocysteine in the essential family of selenoproteins.\n Selenium deficiency, which is the main regulator of selenoprotein expression, has been associated with the pathogenicity of several viruses.\n In addition, several selenoprotein members, including glutathione peroxidases (GPX), thioredoxin reductases (TXNRD) seemed important in different models of viral replication.\n Finally, the formal identification of viral selenoproteins in the genome of molluscum contagiosum and

Against Hepatitis C Virus Which Is Blunted by Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids","abstract":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication.\n In this study, we aimed to further characterize the role of macrophage-derived EVs in immune responses against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the potential of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to modulate this modality of innate immunity.\n To this end, EVs were isolated from interferon-stimulated macrophage cultures or from serum of patients with acute or chronic hepatitis C.\n EVs were characterized by electron microscopy, flow cytometry, RNA-sequencing, and Western blot analysis.\n The effect of EVs on replication of HCV was assessed in coculture models.\n Functional analyses were performed to assess the impact of PUFAs on EV-mediated antiviral immunity.\n We found that macrophages secreted various cytokines shortly after stimulation with type I and II IFN, which orchestrated a fast but short-lasting antiviral state.\n This rapid innate immune answer was followed by the production of macrophage-derived EVs, which induced a late, but long-lasting inhibitory effect on HCV replication.\n Of note, exposure of macrophages to PUFAs, which are important regulators of immune responses, dampened EV-mediated antiviral immune responses.\n Finally, EVs from patients with hepatitis C exhibited long-lasting antiviral activities during IFN therapy as well.\n The antiviral effect of EVs from Caucasian and Japanese patients differed, which may be explained by different nutritional uptake of PUFAs.\n In conclusion, our data indicate that macrophage-derived EVs mediate long-lasting inhibitory effects on HCV replication, which may bridge the time until efficient adaptive immune responses are established, and which can be blunted by PUFAs.\n","id":"PMC5906748","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chengcong","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin","surname":"Koch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kenichi","surname":"Morikawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Goki","surname":"Suda","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Naoya","surname":"Sakamoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sabrina","surname":"Rueschenbaum","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sami","surname":"Akhras","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Julia","surname":"Dietz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eberhard","surname":"Hildt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Zeuzem","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christoph","surname":"Welsch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian

will discuss the current limitations of checkpoint inhibitors in clinical practice and the mechanisms at the basis of a potential application of T?1 in combination

entire genomic RNA and interacts with viron structural proteins, thus playing important roles in the process of virus particle assembly and release.\n Protein–protein interaction analysis using bioinformatics tools indicated that SARS_NP may bind to human cyclophilin A (hCypA), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology revealed this binding with the equilibrium dissociation constant ranging from 6 to 160 nM.\n The probable binding sites of these two proteins were detected by modeling the three-dimensional structure of the SARS_NP–hCypA complex, from which the important interaction residue pairs between the proteins were deduced.\n Mutagenesis experiments were carried out for validating the binding model, whose correctness was assessed by the observed effects on the binding affinities between the proteins.\n The reliability of the binding sites derived by the molecular modeling was confirmed by the fact that the computationally predicted values of the relative free energies of the binding for SARS_NP (or hCypA) mutants to the wild-type hCypA (or SARS_NP) are in good agreement with the data determined by SPR.\n Such presently observed SARS_NP–hCypA

disease.\n The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 has demonstrated human vulnerability to (Coronavirus) CoV epidemics.\n Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are available against human and animal CoVs.\n Knowledge of host cell proteins that take part in pivotal virus-host interactions could define broad-spectrum antiviral targets.\n In this study, we used a systems biology approach employing a genome-wide yeast-two hybrid interaction screen to identify immunopilins (PPIA, PPIB, PPIH, PPIG, FKBP1A, FKBP1B) as interaction partners of the CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1).\n These molecules modulate the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation.\n Overexpression of NSP1 and infection with live SARS-CoV strongly increased signalling through the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway and enhanced the induction of interleukin 2, compatible with late-stage immunopathogenicity and long-term cytokine dysregulation as observed in severe SARS cases.\n Conversely, inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A (CspA) blocked the replication of CoVs of all genera, including SARS-CoV, human CoV-229E and -NL-63, feline CoV, as well as avian infectious bronchitis virus.\n Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of CspA might serve as broad-range CoV inhibitors applicable against emerging CoVs as well as ubiquitous pathogens of

Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model.\n Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.\n","id":"PMC5844999","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria L.","surname":"Agostini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Erica L.","surname":"Andres","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy C.","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rachel L.","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy P.","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotao","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Everett Clinton","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James Brett","surname":"Case","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joy Y.","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Jordan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Adrian S.","surname":"Ray","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tomas","surname":"Cihlar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dustin","surname":"Siegel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard L.","surname":"Mackman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael O.","surname":"Clarke","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark R.","surname":"Denison","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kanta","surname":"Subbarao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kanta","surname":"Subbarao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001191","date":"1970-01-01","title":"First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States","abstract":"An outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that began in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries.\n We report the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the United States and describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the patient’s initial mild symptoms at presentation with progression to pneumonia on day 9 of illness.\n This case highlights the importance of close coordination between clinicians and public health authorities at the local, state, and federal levels, as well as the need for rapid dissemination of clinical information related to the care of patients with this emerging infection.\n","id":"PMC7092802","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Michelle L.","surname":"Holshue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chas","surname":"DeBolt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Scott","surname":"Lindquist","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy H.","surname":"Lofy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Wiesman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hollianne","surname":"Bruce","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Spitters","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Keith","surname":"Ericson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sara","surname":"Wilkerson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ahmet","surname":"Tural","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George","surname":"Diaz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amanda","surname":"Cohn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"LeAnne","surname":"Fox","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anita","surname":"Patel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan I.","surname":"Gerber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lindsay","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suxiang","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyan","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Steve","surname":"Lindstrom","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark A.","surname":"Pallansch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"William C.","surname":"Weldon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Holly M.","surname":"Biggs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy M.","surname":"Uyeki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Satish K.","surname":"Pillai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.2165/00003495-199856010-00013","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nelfinavir.

IBV replicates not only in respiratory tissues (including the nose, trachea, lungs and airsacs, causing respiratory disease), but also in the kidney (associated with minor or major nephritis), oviduct, and in many parts of the alimentary tract—the oesophagus, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, bursa of Fabricius, caecal tonsils, rectum and cloaca, usually without clinical effects.\n The virus can persist, being re-excreted at the onset of egg laying (4 to 5 months of age), believed to be a consequence of the stress of coming into lay.\n Genetic lines of chickens differ in the extent to which IBV causes mortality in chicks, and in respect of clearance of the virus after the acute phase.\n Live attenuated (by passage in chicken embryonated eggs) IBV strains were introduced as vaccines in the 1950s, followed a couple of decades later by inactivated vaccines for boosting protection in egg-laying birds.\n Live vaccines are usually applied to meat-type chickens at 1 day of age.\n In experimental situations this can result in sterile immunity when challenged by virulent homologous virus.\n Although 100% of chickens may be protected (against clinical signs and loss of ciliary activity in trachea), sometimes 10% of vaccinated chicks may not respond with a protective immune response.\n Protection is short lived, the start of the decline being apparent 9 weeks after vaccination with vaccines based on highly attenuated strains.\n IBV exists as scores of serotypes (defined by the neutralization test), cross-protection often being poor.\n Consequently, chickens may be re-vaccinated, with the same or another serotype, two or three weeks later.\n Single applications of inactivated virus has generally led to protection of &lt;50% of chickens.\n Two applications have led to 90 to 100% protection in some reports, but remaining below 50% in others.\n In practice in the field, inactivated vaccines are used in laying birds that have previously been primed with two or three live attenuated virus vaccinations.\n This increases protection of the laying birds against egg production losses and induces a sustained level of serum antibody, which is passed to progeny.\n The large spike glycoprotein (S) comprises a carboxy-terminal S2 subunit (approximately 625 amino acid residues), which anchors S in the virus envelope, and an amino-terminal S1 subunit (approximately 520 residues), believed to largely form the distal bulbous part of S.\n The S1 subunit (purified from IBV virus, expressed using baculovirus or expressed in birds from a fowlpoxvirus vector) induced virus neutralizing antibody.\n Although protective immune responses were induced, multiple inoculations were required and the percentage of protected chickens was too low (&lt;50%) for commercial application.\n Remarkably, expression of S1 in birds using a non-pathogenic fowl adenovirus vector induced protection in 90% and 100% of chickens in two experiments.\n Differences of as little as 5% between the S1 sequences can result in poor cross-protection.\n Differences in S1 of 2 to 3% (10 to 15 amino acids) can change serotype, suggesting that a small number of epitopes are immunodominant with respect to neutralizing antibody.\n Initial studies of the role of the IBV nucleocapsid protein (N) in immunity suggested that immunization with bacterially expressed N, while not inducing protection directly, improved the induction of protection by a subsequent inoculation with inactivated IBV.\n In another study, two intramuscular immunizations of a plasmid expressing N induced protective immunity.\n The basis of immunity to IBV is not well understood.\n Serum antibody levels do not correlate with protection, although local antibody is believed to play a role.\n Adoptive transfer of IBV-infection-induced ?? T cells bearing CD8 antigen protected chicks from challenge infection.\n In conclusion, live attenuated IBV vaccines induce good, although short-lived, protection against homologous challenge, although a minority of individuals may respond poorly.\n Inactivated IBV vaccines are insufficiently efficacious when applied only once and in the absence of priming by live vaccine.\n Two applications of inactivated IBV are much more efficacious, although this is not a commercially viable proposition in the poultry industry.\n However, the cost and logistics of multiple application of a SARS inactivated vaccine would be more acceptable for the protection of human populations, especially if limited to targeted groups (e.\ng.\n health care workers and high-risk contacts).\n Application of a SARS vaccine is perhaps best limited to a minimal number of targeted individuals who can be monitored, as some vaccinated persons might, if infected by SARS coronavirus, become asymptomatic excretors of virus, thereby posing a risk to non-vaccinated people.\n Looking further into the future, the high efficacy of the fowl adenovirus vector expressing the IBV S1 subunit provides optimism for a live SARS vaccine, if that were deemed to be necessary, with the possibility of including the N protein gene.\n","id":"PMC7154303","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dave","surname":"Cavanagh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.virol.2014.01.002","date":"2014-01-03","title":"Protection from SARS coronavirus conferred by live measles vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein","abstract":"The recent identification of a novel human coronavirus responsible of a SARS-like illness in the Middle-East a decade after the SARS pandemic, demonstrates that reemergence of a SARS-like coronavirus from an animal reservoir remains a credible threat.\n Because SARS is contracted by aerosolized contamination of the respiratory tract, a vaccine inducing mucosal long-term protection would be an asset to control new epidemics.\n To this aim, we generated live attenuated recombinant measles vaccine (MV) candidates expressing either the membrane-anchored SARS-CoV spike (S) protein or its secreted soluble ectodomain (Ssol).\n In mice susceptible to measles virus, recombinant MV expressing the anchored full-length S induced the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies and fully protected immunized animals from intranasal infectious challenge with SARS-CoV.\n As compared to immunization with adjuvanted recombinant Ssol protein, recombinant MV induced stronger and Th1-biased responses, a hallmark of live attenuated viruses and a highly desirable feature for an antiviral vaccine.\n","id":"PMC7111909","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Escriou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benoît","surname":"Callendret","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Valérie","surname":"Lorin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chantal","surname":"Combredet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Marianneau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michèle","surname":"Février","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frédéric","surname":"Tangy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.virol.2018.05.028","date":"2018-05-31","title":"Live-attenuated bivalent measles virus-derived vaccines targeting Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus induce robust and multifunctional T cell responses against both viruses in an appropriate mouse model","abstract":"Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continue to occur, making it one of the WHO´s targets for accelerated vaccine development.\n One vaccine candidate is based on live-attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccine encoding the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (MERS-S).\n MVvac2-MERS-S(H) induces robust humoral and cellular immunity against MERS-S mediating protection.\n Here, the induction and nature of immunity after vaccination with MVvac2-MERS-S(H) or novel MVvac2-MERS-N were further characterized.\n We focused on the necessity for vector replication and the nature of induced T cells, since functional CD8+ T cells contribute importantly to clearance of MERS-CoV.\n While no immunity against MERS-CoV or MV was detected in MV-susceptible mice after immunization with UV-inactivated virus, replication-competent MVvac2-MERS-S(H) triggered robust neutralizing antibody titers also in adult mice.\n Furthermore, a significant fraction of MERS CoV-specific CD8+ T cells and MV-specific CD4+ T cells simultaneously expressing IFN-?

patients: a single center feasibility trial of the PEP uP protocol","abstract":"Introduction\nThe purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of a new feeding protocol designed to enhance the delivery of enteral nutrition (EN).\n\n\nMethods\nIn a prospective before and after study, we evaluated a new protocol compared to our standard feeding protocol.\n\n Innovative elements of the new protocol included setting daily volume based goals instead of hourly rate targets, initiating motility agents and protein supplements on Day 1, liberalizing the gastric residual volume threshold, and the option to use trophic feeds.\n\n Bedside nurses filled out questionnaires to assess the acceptability of the new approach and we assessed patients' nutritional and clinical outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nWe enrolled 20 mechanically ventilated patients who stayed in the Intensive Care Unit for more than three days in the before group and 30 such patients in the after group.\n\n On a scale where 1 = totally unacceptable and 10 = totally acceptable, 30 nurses rated the new protocol as 7.1 (range 1 to 10) and no incidents compromising patient safety were observed.\n\n In the before group, on average, patients received 58.8% of their energy and 61.2% of their protein requirements by EN compared to 67.9% and 73.6% in the after group (P = 0.33 and 0.13).\n\n When the subgroup of patients prescribed to receive full volume feeds in the after group were evaluated (n = 18), they received 83.2% and 89.4% of their energy and protein requirements by EN respectively (P = 0.02 for energy and 0.002 for protein compared to the before group).\n\n The rates of vomiting, regurgitation, aspiration, and pneumonia were similar between the two groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis new feeding protocol seems to be safe and acceptable to critical care nurses.\n\n The adoption of this protocol may be associated with enhanced delivery of EN but further trials are warranted to evaluate its effect on nutritional and clinical endpoints.\n\n\nTrial registration\nClinicalTrials.\n\ngov

However, most studies use predictive equations, demonstrated to be inaccurate to target energy intake.\n\n We sought to examine the outcome of a large cohort of ICU patients in relation to the percent of administered calories divided by resting energy expenditure (% AdCal/REE) obtained by indirect calorimetry (IC) and to protein intake.\n\n\nMethods\nIncluded patients were hospitalized from 2003 to 2015 at a 16-bed ICU at a university affiliated, tertiary care hospital, and had IC measurement to assess caloric targets.\n\n Data were drawn from a computerized system and included the % AdCal/REE and protein intake and other variables.\n\n A Cox proportional hazards model for 60-day mortality was used, with the % AdCal/REE modeled to accommodate non-linearity.\n\n Length of stay (LOS) and length of ventilation (LOV) were also assessed.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 1171 patients were included.\n\n The % AdCal/REE had a significant non-linear (p?&lt;?0.01) association with mortality after adjusting for other variables (p?&lt;?0.01).\n\n Increasing the percentage from zero to 70 % resulted in a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.98 (CI 0.97–0.99) pointing to reduced mortality, while increases above 70 % suggested an increase in mortality with a HR of 1.01 (CI 1.01–1.02).\n\n Increasing protein intake was also associated with decreased mortality (HR 0.99, CI 0.98–0.99, p?=?0.02).\n\n An AdCal/REE &gt;70 % was associated with an increased LOS and LOV.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe findings of this study suggest that both underfeeding and overfeeding appear to be harmful to critically ill patients, such that achieving an Adcal/REE of 70 % had a survival advantage.\n\n A higher caloric intake may also be associated with harm in the form of increased LOS and LOV.\n\n The optimal way to define caloric goals therefore requires an exact estimate, which is ideally performed using indirect calorimetry.\n\n These findings may provide a basis for future randomized controlled trials comparing specific nutritional regimens based on indirect calorimetry measurements.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5105237","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Oren","surname":"Zusman","email":"orenzu1@clalit.org.il","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Miriam","surname":"Theilla","email":"miriamt@clalit.org.il","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Miriam","surname":"Theilla","email":"miriamt@clalit.org.il","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan","surname":"Cohen","email":"jonatanc@clalit.org.il","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ilya","surname":"Kagan","email":"ilyak@clalit.org.il","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Itai","surname":"Bendavid","email":"itaibd@clalit.org.il","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Singer","email":"psinger@clalit.org.il","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jamda.2013.05.021","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence-based

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/hdi.12549","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Monocyte/lymphocyte ratio as a better predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients: a prospective cohort study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte counts-rapid and simple parameter of systemic inflammation and stress in critically ill","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2147/TCRM.S206930","date":"2019-05-08","title":"Neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio as an early new marker in AIV-H7N9-infected patients: a retrospective study","abstract":"Background: Avian AIV-H7N9 influenza progresses rapidly and has a high fatality rate.\n However, it lacks an early effective biomarker to predict disease severity and fatal outcomes successfully.\n Our study aimed to explore whether the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) taken within 24 h after admission can predict disease severity and fatality in AIV-H7N9-infected patients.\n","id":"PMC6661995","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pengfei","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hainv","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meifang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Yi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianhe","surname":"Gan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinzhong","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weihong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenhong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lanjuan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World Health Organization.

Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia have not previously been described in detail.\n\n\nPurpose\nTo investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging 2019-nCoV pneumonia in humans.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nFifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women; age range 16–76 years) with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction underwent thin-section CT.\n\n The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nFifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China.\n\n Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms.\n\n Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count.\n\n CT images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients.\n\n GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients.\n\n Forty-four of 51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral.\n\n There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n Follow-up CT in 13 patients showed improvement in seven (54%) patients and progression in four (31%) patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nPatients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground-glass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images, combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure, are highly suspected of having 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

The area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) in the 50 mg/kg dose (27?498 ?g?×?days per mL) is comparable to the AUC that was associated with efficacy in a preclinical model.\n\n\nInterpretation\nSingle infusions of SAB-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well tolerated in healthy participants.\n\n Human immunoglobulin derived from transchromosomic cattle could offer a new platform technology to produce fully human polyclonal IgG antibodies for other medical conditions.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5871563","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"John H","surname":"Beigel","email":"jbeigel@niaid.nih.gov","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jocelyn","surname":"Voell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Parag","surname":"Kumar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kanakatte","surname":"Raviprakash","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jin-An","surname":"Jiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eddie","surname":"Sullivan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Luke","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard T","surname":"Davey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30266-X","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Safety and immunogenicity of an anti-Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus DNA vaccine: a phase 1, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation trial","abstract":"Background\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus causes a highly fatal lower-respiratory tract infection.\n\n There are as yet no licensed MERS vaccines or therapeutics.\n\n This study (WRAIR-2274) assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine in healthy adults.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study was a phase 1, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study of GLS-5300 done at the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research Clinical Trials Center (Silver Spring, MD, USA).\n\n We enrolled healthy adults aged 18–50 years; exclusion criteria included previous infection or treatment of MERS.\n\n Eligible participants were enrolled sequentially using a dose-escalation protocol to receive 0·67 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg GLS-5300 administered by trained clinical site staff via a single intramuscular 1 mL injection at each vaccination at baseline, week 4, and week 12 followed immediately by co-localised intramuscular electroporation.\n\n Enrolment into the higher dose groups occurred after a safety monitoring committee reviewed the data following vaccination of the first five participants at the previous lower dose in each group.\n\n The primary outcome of the study was safety, assessed in all participants who received at least one study treatment and for whom post-dose study data were available, during the vaccination period with follow-up through to 48 weeks after dose 3. Safety was measured by the incidence of adverse events; administration site reactions and pain; and changes in safety laboratory parameters.\n\n The secondary outcome was immunogenicity.\n\n This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov (number NCT02670187) and is completed.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Feb 17 and July 22, 2016, we enrolled 75 individuals and allocated 25 each to 0·67 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg GLS-5300. No vaccine-associated serious adverse events were reported.\n\n The most common adverse events were injection-site reactions, reported in 70 participants (93%) of 75. Overall, 73 participants (97%) of 75 reported at least one solicited adverse event; the most common systemic symptoms were headache (five [20%] with 0·67 mg, 11 [44%] with 2 mg, and seven [28%] with 6

self-limiting.\n\n Unsolicited symptoms were reported for 56 participants (75%) of 75 and were deemed treatment-related for 26 (35%).\n\n The most common unsolicited adverse events were infections, occurring in 27 participants (36%); six (8%) were deemed possibly related to study treatment.\n\n There were no laboratory abnormalities of grade 3 or higher that were related to study treatment; laboratory abnormalities were uncommon, except for 15 increases in creatine phosphokinase in 14 participants (three participants in the 0·67 mg group, three in the 2 mg group, and seven in the 6 mg group).\n\n Of these 15 increases, five (33%) were deemed possibly related to study treatment (one in the 2 mg group and four in the 6 mg group).\n\n Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 59

focus on diagnostics","abstract":"Diagnostics play a central role in the early detection and control of outbreaks and can enable a more nuanced understanding of the disease kinetics and risk factors for the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), one of the high-priority pathogens identified by the WHO.\n In this review we identified sources for molecular and serological diagnostic tests used in MERS-CoV detection, case management and outbreak investigations, as well as surveillance for humans and animals (camels), and summarised the performance of currently available tests, diagnostic needs, and associated challenges for diagnostic test development and implementation.\n A more detailed understanding of the kinetics of infection of MERS-CoV is needed in order to optimise the use of existing assays.\n Notably, MERS-CoV point-of-care tests are needed in order to optimise supportive care and to minimise transmission risk.\n However, for new test development, sourcing clinical material continues to be a major challenge to achieving assay validation.\n Harmonisation and standardisation of laboratory methods are essential for surveillance and for a rapid and effective international response to emerging diseases.\n Routine external quality assessment, along with well-characterised and up-to-date proficiency panels, would provide insight into MERS-CoV diagnostic performance worldwide.\n A defined set of Target Product Profiles for diagnostic technologies will be developed by WHO to address these gaps in MERS-CoV outbreak management.\n","id":"PMC6361340","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cassandra","surname":"Kelly-Cirino","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laura

implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences,

distribution and correlates of serum albumin levels among individuals with motor disorders have not been reported until now.\n\n Therefore, we examined the distribution and correlates of serum albumin levels among individuals with motor disorders.\n\n\nSUBJECTS/METHODS\nA cross-sectional study on 249 individuals with motor disabilities (144 men, mean age: 51.4 years; 105 women, mean age: 51.4 years) was conducted at five institutions in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan in 2008. The results were compared with data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean serum albumin levels were 4.0 ± 0.4 g/dL for men and 3.8 ± 0.5 g/dL for women.\n\n Overall, 17 (11.8%) men and 25 (23.8%) women had hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin level ? 3.5 g/dL); these proportions were greater than those among healthy Japanese adults (? 1%).\n\n Low serum albumin level was related with female sex, older age, low calf circumference, low relative daily energy intake, low hemoglobin (Hb), low blood platelet count, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low HbA1c, and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.\n\n The strongest correlates, based on standardized betas, were Hb (0.321), CRP (-0.279), and HDL-C (0.279) levels.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results indicate that the prevalence of hypoalbuminemia is higher in individuals with motor disabilities than in healthy individuals and that inflammation is a strong negative correlate of serum albumin levels.\n\n Therefore, inflammation should be examined for the assessment of hypoalbuminemia among institutionalized individuals with motor disabilities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5300948","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hiroko","surname":"Ohwada","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Takeo","surname":"Nakayama","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuki","surname":"Kanaya","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuki","surname":"Tanaka","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Identification of feeding risk factors for impaired nutrition status in paediatric patients with cerebral palsy","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Feeding method and health outcomes of children with cerebral palsy","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Characteristics and management of feeding problems of young children with cerebral palsy","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Impact of feeding problems on nutritional intake and growth: Oxford Feeding Study II","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Dysphagia in the elderly: management and nutritional considerations","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Malnutrition and dehydration after stroke","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nutrition in the stroke patient","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Growth patterns in a population of children and adolescents with cerebral palsy","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"An unexpected finding in an eight-year-old child with cerebral palsy and weight loss","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Weight loss after stroke: a population-based study from the Lund Stroke Register","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Questions &amp; answers from the JCAHO.

anxiety and depression (PSSCAN).\n\n No information on cut-off scores or their meaning for diagnosis was available when PSSCAN was first described.\n\n Needed were additional analyses to recommend empirically justified cut-off scores as well as data norms for healthy adult samples so as to lend meaning to the recommended cut-off scores.\n\n\nMethods\nWe computed sensitivity/specificity indices based on a sample of 101 cancer patients who had provided PSSCAN data on anxiety and depression and who had completed another standardized instrument with strong psychometrics.\n\n Next, we compared mean scores for four samples with known differences in health status, a healthy community sample (n = 561), a sample of patients with a representative mix of cancer subtypes (n = 570), a more severely ill sample of in-patients with cancer (n = 78), and a community sample with a chronic illness other than cancer (n = 85).\n\n\nResults\nSensitivity/specificity analyses revealed that an excellent balance of sensitivity/specificity was achievable with 92%/98% respectively for clinical anxiety and 100% and 86% respectively for clinical depression.\n\n Newly diagnosed patients with cancer were no more anxious than healthy community controls but showed elevations in depression scores.\n\n Both, patients with chronic illness other than cancer and those with longer-standing cancer diagnoses

the last.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the long-term psychiatric morbidities in survivors of SARS.\n\n\nMethod\nThis is a cohort study designed to investigate psychiatric complications among SARS survivors treated in the United Christian Hospital 30 months after the SARS outbreak.\n\n Psychiatric morbidities were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Impact of Events Scale–Revised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n\n Functional outcomes were assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey.\n\n\nResults\nNinety subjects were recruited, yielding a response rate of 96.8%.\n\n Post-SARS cumulative incidence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was 58.9%.\n\n Current prevalence for any psychiatric disorder at 30 months post-SARS was 33.3%.\n\n One-fourth of the patients had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 15.6% had depressive disorders.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe outbreak of SARS can be regarded as a mental health catastrophe.\n\n PTSD was the most prevalent long-term psychiatric condition, followed by depressive disorders.\n\n Our results highlight the need to enhance preparedness and competence of health care professionals in detecting and managing the psychological sequelae of future comparable infectious disease outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112501","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ivan Wing
