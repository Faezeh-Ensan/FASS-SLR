Besides, an increase up to 69% was observed in individuals with a medical history of CVD.\n\n Conclusion: Despite interesting results, the association was not statistically significant.\n\n A possible explanation to this result can be that the population affected by the flood was probably too small to provide the statistical power to answer the question, and leaves open a substantial possibility for a real and large effect.\n\n","id":"PMC4772188","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alain","surname":"Vanasse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Alan","surname":"Cohen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Josiane","surname":"Courteau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Patrick","surname":"Bergeron","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Roxanne","surname":"Dault","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Pierre","surname":"Gosselin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Claudia","surname":"Blais","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Diane","surname":"Bélanger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Louis","surname":"Rochette","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Fateh","surname":"Chebana","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jan","surname":"Semenza","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"                           Jan","surname":"Semenza","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Climat Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Making Flood Insurable for Canadian Homeowners: A Discussion Paper","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ouranos Vers, L'adaptation.

examined associations of stressful life events (SLE) and social strain with incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke (overall, and for hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes) independent of sociodemographic characteristics, and we evaluated whether these relationships were explained by traditional behavioral and biological risk factors.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nData from approximately 82 000 Women's Health Initiative Observational Study participants were used for the SLE and social strain analyses, respectively.\n\n Participants were followed for events for up to 18.0 years (median, 14.0).\n\n Separate Cox proportional hazards models were generated to estimate associations of each stress measure with incident CVD.\n\n After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and depressive symptoms, higher SLE and social strain were associated with higher incident CHD and stroke (each P trend &lt;0.05).\n\n Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 1.12 (1.01, 1.25) for incident CHD and 1.14 (1.01, 1.28) for incident stroke among participants reporting high versus low SLE.\n\n Findings were similar for social strain.\n\n Associations were attenuated with further adjustment for mediating behavioral and biological risk factors.\n\n Findings were similar for associations of SLE with ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, but social strain was only associated with ischemic stroke.\n\n\nConclusions\nHigher SLE and social strain were associated with higher incident CVD independent of sociodemographic factors and depressive symptoms, but not behavioral and biological risk factors.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4309050","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kiarri

Disease Hospitalizations in Louisiana Parishes’ Elderly before, during and after Hurricane Katrina","abstract":"The research on how health and health care disparities impact response to and recovery from a disaster, especially among diverse and underserved populations is in great need for a thorough evaluation.\n\n The time series analysis utilizing most complete national databases of medical records is an indispensable tool in assessing the destruction and health toll brought about by natural disasters.\n\n In this study, we demonstrated such an application by evaluating the impact of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 on cardiovascular disease (CVD), a primary cause of mortality among older adults that can be aggravated by natural disasters.\n\n We compared CVD hospitalizations before, during and after Katrina between white and black residents of three most populated parishes in Louisiana: Orleans and Jefferson, which were severely affected by the landfall and subsequent floods, and East Baton Rouge, which hosted many of the evacuees.\n\n We abstracted 383,552 CVD hospitalization records for Louisiana’s patients aged 65+ in 2005–2006 from the database maintained by the Center of Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.\n\n Daily time series of CVD-related hospitalization rates at each study parish were compiled, and the changes were characterized using segmented regression.\n\n In Orleans Parish, directly affected by the hurricane, hospitalization rates peaked on the 6th day after landfall with an increase (mean ± SD) from 7.25 ± 2.4 to 18.5 ± 17.3 cases/day per 10,000 adults aged 65+ (p &lt; 0.001) and returned to pre-landfall level after ~2 months.\n\n Disparities in CVD rates between black and white older adults were exacerbated during and following landfall.\n\n In Orleans Parish, a week after landfall, the CVD rates increased to 26.3 ± 23.7 and 16.6 ± 11.7 cases/day per 10,000 people (p &lt; 0.001) for black and white patients, respectively.\n\n The abrupt increase in CVDs is likely due to psychosocial and post-traumatic stress caused by the disaster and inadequate response.\n\n Inequities in resource allocation and access have to be addressed in disaster preparation and mitigation.\n\n","id":"PMC6339087","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ninon

natural disasters.\n\n Iran, a developing country in Asia, is prone to earthquakes and is ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries in the world in this respect.\n\n The medical response in disasters is accompanied by managerial, logistic, technical, and medical challenges being also the case in the Bam earthquake in Iran.\n\n Our objective was to explore the medical response to the Bam earthquake with specific emphasis on pre-hospital medical management during the first days.\n\n\nMethods\nThe study was performed in 2008; an interview based qualitative study using content analysis.\n\n We conducted nineteen interviews with experts and managers responsible for responding to the Bam earthquake, including pre-hospital emergency medical services, the Red Crescent, and Universities of Medical Sciences.\n\n The selection of participants was determined by using a purposeful sampling method.\n\n Sample size was given by data saturation.\n\n\nResults\nThe pre-hospital medical service was divided into three categories; triage, emergency medical care and transportation, each category in turn was identified into facilitators and obstacles.\n\n The obstacles identified were absence of a structured disaster plan, absence of standardized medical teams, and shortage of resources.\n\n The army and skilled medical volunteers were identified as facilitators.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe most compelling, and at the same time amenable obstacle, was the lack of a disaster management plan.\n\n It was evident that implementing a comprehensive plan would

to continue in response to international disasters.\n\n As part of a national survey, this study was designed to evaluate Australian DMAT experience in relation to the human resources issues associated with deployment.\n\n\nMethods\nData was collected via an anonymous mailed survey distributed via State and Territory representatives on the Australian Health Protection Committee, who identified team members associated with Australian DMAT deployments from the 2004 South East Asian Tsunami disaster.\n\n\nResults\nThe response rate for this survey was 50% (59/118).\n\n Most personnel had deployed to the Asian Tsunami affected areas with DMAT members having significant clinical and international experience.\n\n While all except one respondent stated they received a full orientation prior to deployment, only 34% of respondents (20/59) felt their role was clearly defined pre deployment.\n\n Approximately 56% (33/59) felt their actual role matched their intended role and that their clinical background was well suited to their tasks.\n\n Most respondents were prepared to be available for deployment for 1 month (34%, 20/59).\n\n The most common period of notice needed to deploy was 6–12 hours for 29% (17/59) followed by 12–24 hours for 24% (14/59).\n\n The preferred period of overseas deployment was 14–21 days (46%, 27/59) followed by 1 month (25%, 15/59) and the optimum shift period was felt to be 12 hours by 66% (39/59).\n\n The majority felt that there was both adequate pay (71%, 42/59) and adequate indemnity (66%, 39/59).\n\n Almost half (49%, 29/59) stated it was better to work with people from the same hospital and, while most felt their deployment could be easily covered by staff from their workplace (56%, 33/59) and caused an inconvenience to their colleagues (51%, 30/59), it was less likely to interrupt service delivery in their workplace (10%, 6/59) or cause an inconvenience to patients (9%, 5/59).\n\n Deployment was felt to benefit the affected community by nearly all (95%, 56/59) while less (42%, 25/59) felt that there was a benefit for their own local community.\n\n Nearly all felt their role was recognised on return (93%, 55/59) and an identical number (93%, 55/59) enjoyed the experience.\n\n All stated they would volunteer again, with 88% strongly agreeing with this statement.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study of Australian DMAT members provides significant insights into a number of human resources issues and should help guide future deployments.\n\n The preferred ‘on call’ arrangements, notice to deploy, period of overseas deployment and shift length are all identified.\n\n This extended period of operations needs to be supported by planning and provision of rest cycles, food, temporary accommodation and rest areas for staff.\n\n The study also suggests that more emphasis should be placed on team selection and clarification of roles.\n\n While the majority felt that there was both adequate pay and adequate indemnity, further work clarifying this, based on national conditions of service should be, and are, being explored currently by the state based teams in Australia.\n\n Importantly, the deployment was viewed positively by team members who all stated they would volunteer again, which allows the development of an experienced cohort of team members.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3366111","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Aitken","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Leggat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hazel","surname":"Harley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Speare","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Muriel","surname":"Leclercq","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/currents.dis.8297b528bd45975bc6291804747ee5db","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hospitals Safety from Disasters in I.R.Iran: The Results from Assessment of 224 Hospitals","abstract":"Background and objective: Iran’s hospitals have been considerably affected by disasters during last decade.\n To address this, health system of I.\nR.\nIran has taken an initiative to assess disaster safety of the hospitals using an adopted version of Hospital Safety Index (HSI).\n This article presents the results of disaster safety assessment in 224 Iran’s hospitals.\n\nMethods: A self-assessment approach was applied to assess the disaster safety in 145 items categorized in 3 components including structural, non-structural and functional capacity.\n For each item, safety level was categorized to 3 levels: not safe (0), average safe (1) and high safe (2).\n A raw score was tallied for each safety component and its elements by a simple sum of all the corresponding scores.\n All scores were normalized on a 100 point scale.\n Hospitals were classified to three safety classes according to their normalized total score: low (?34.0), average (34.01-66.0) and high (&gt;66.0).\n\nResults: The average score of all safety components were 32.4 out of 100 (± 12.7 SD).\n 122 hospitals (54.5%) were classified as low safe and 102 hospitals (45.5%) were classified as average safe.\n No hospital was placed in the high safe category.\n Average safety scores out of 100 were 27.3 (±14.2 SD) for functional capacity, 36.0 (±13.9 SD) for non-structural component and 36.0 (±19.0 SD) for structural component.\n Neither the safety classes nor the scores of safety components were significantly associated with types of hospitals in terms of affiliation, function and size (P&gt;0.05).\n\nConclusions: To enhance the hospitals safety for disaster in Iran, we recommend: 1) establishment of a national committee for hospital safety in disasters; 2) supervision on implementation of the safety standards in construction of new hospitals; 3) enhancement of functional readiness and safety of non-structural components while structural retrofitting of the existing hospitals is being taken into consideration, whenever is cost-effective; 4) considering the disaster safety status as the criteria for licensing and accreditation of the hospitals.\n\nKey words: Hospital, safety, disaster, emergency, Iran\nCorrespondence to: Ali Ardalan MD, PhD.\n Tehran University of Medical Sciences,

outcome, particularly because of the delay in obtaining definitive mortality results.\n\n Since emergency department (ED) activity reflects the global increase of patients' health problems during this period, the profile of patients referred to EDs might be a basis to detect an excess mortality in the catchment area.\n\n Our objective was to develop a real-time surveillance model based on ED data to detect excessive heat-related mortality as early as possible.\n\n\nMethods\nA day-to-day composite indicator was built using simple and easily obtainable variables related to patients referred to the ED during the 2003 heat-wave period.\n\n The design involved a derivation and validation study based on a real-time surveillance system of two EDs at Cochin Hospital and Hôtel-Dieu Hospital, Paris, France.\n\n The participants were 99,976 adult patients registered from 1 May to 30 September during 2001, 2002 and 2003. Among these participants, 3,297, 3,580 and 3,851 patients were referred to the EDs from 3 August to 19 August for 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.\n\n Variables retained for the indicator were selected using the receiver operating characteristic curve methodology and polynomial regression.\n\n\nResults\nThe indicator was composed of only three variables: the percentage of patients older than 70 years, the percentage of patients with body temperature above 39°C, and the percentage of patients admitted to or who died in the ED.\n\n The curve of the indicator with time appropriately fitted the overall mortality that occurred in the region of interest.\n\n\nConclusion\nA composite and simple index based on real-time surveillance was developed according to the profile of patients who visited the ED.\n\n It appeared suitable for determining the overall mortality in the corresponding region submitted to the 2003 heat wave.\n\n This index should help early warning of excessive mortality and monitoring the efficacy of public health interventions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1794460","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yann-Erick","surname":"Claessens","email":"yann-erick.claessens@cch.ap-hop-paris.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Taupin","email":"taupin@necker.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gérald","surname":"Kierzek","email":"gerald.kierzek@htd.ap-hop-paris.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Louis","surname":"Pourriat","email":"jlpourriat@invivo.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michel","surname":"Baud","email":"michel.baud@htd.ap-hop-paris.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Ginsburg","email":"christine.ginsburg@cch.ap-hop-paris.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jean-Philippe","surname":"Jais","email":"jais@necker.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Jougla","email":"Eric.Jougla@vesinet.inserm.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Riou","email":"bruno.riou@psl.ap-hop-paris.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jean-François","surname":"Dhainaut","email":"president@univ-paris5.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Landais","email":"landais@necker.fr","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Mortality and morbidity in Birmingham during the 1976 heatwave","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1093/epirev/mxf007","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Relation between Elevated Ambient Temperature and Mortality: A Review of the Epidemiologic Evidence","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1289/ehp.1205223","date":"2012-10-02","title":"Climate Change and Older Americans: State of the Science","abstract":"Background: Older adults make up 13% of the U.\nS.\n population, but are projected to account for 20% by 2040.

Among people aged over 74 years, daily hospital admissions for disorders of fluid and electrolyte balance, acute renal failure, and heat stroke (grouped in a single nosologic entity, heat diseases, HD), respiratory diseases (RD), circulatory diseases (CD), and a reference category chosen a priori (fractures of the femur, FF) were independently analyzed by Generalized Estimating Equations.\n\n\nResults\nHeatwave duration, not intensity, increased the risk of hospital admissions for HD and RD by, respectively, 16% (p &lt; .\n\n0001) and 5% (p &lt; .\n\n0001) with each additional day of heatwave duration.\n\n At least four consecutive hot humid days were required to observe a major increase in hospital admissions, the excesses being more than twofold for HD (p &lt;

dynamics of the influenza virus, such as time of onset and circulating strains, are well documented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Influenza Surveillance System, an accurate prediction of timing, magnitude, and composition of circulating strains of seasonal influenza remains elusive.\n\n To facilitate public health preparedness for seasonal influenza and to obtain better insights into the spatiotemporal behavior of emerging strains, it is important to develop measurable characteristics of seasonal oscillation and to quantify the relationships between those parameters on a spatial scale.\n\n The objectives of our research were to examine the seasonality of influenza on a national and state level as well as the relationship between peak timing and intensity of influenza in the United States older adult population.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nA total of 248,889 hospitalization records were extracted from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the influenza seasons 1991–2004. Harmonic regression models were used to quantify the peak timing and absolute intensity for each of the 48 contiguous states and Washington, DC.\n\n We found that individual influenza seasons showed spatial synchrony with consistent late or early timing occurring across all 48 states during each influenza season in comparison to the overall average.\n\n On a national level, seasons that had an earlier peak also had higher rates of influenza (rs?=??0.5).\n\n We demonstrated a spatial trend in peak timing of influenza; western states such as Nevada, Utah, and California peaked earlier and New England States such as Rhode Island, Maine, and New Hampshire peaked later.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nOur findings suggest that a systematic description of influenza seasonal patterns is a valuable tool for disease surveillance and can facilitate strategies for prevention of severe disease in the vulnerable, older adult population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2855366","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Julia B.","surname":"Wenger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elena N.","surname":"Naumova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter W.","surname":"Gething","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Peter W.","surname":"Gething","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/1476-069X-8-40","date":"2009-09-16","title":"High ambient temperature and mortality: a review of epidemiologic studies from 2001 to 2008","abstract":"Background\nThis review examines recent evidence on mortality from elevated ambient temperature for studies published from January 2001 to December 2008.\nMethods\nPubMed was used to search for the following keywords: temperature, apparent temperature, heat, heat index, and mortality.\n\n The search was limited to the English language and epidemiologic studies.\n\n Studies that reported mortality counts or excess deaths following heat waves were excluded so that the focus remained on general ambient temperature and mortality in a variety of locations.\n\n Studies focusing on cold temperature effects were also excluded.\n\n\nResults\nThirty-six total studies were presented in three tables: 1) elevated ambient temperature and mortality; 2) air pollutants as confounders and/or effect modifiers of the elevated ambient temperature and mortality association; and 3) vulnerable subgroups of the elevated ambient temperature-mortality association.\n\n The evidence suggests that particulate matter with less than 10 um in aerodynamic diameter and ozone may confound the association, while ozone was an effect modifier in the warmer months in some locations.\n\n Nonetheless, the independent effect of temperature and mortality was withheld.\n\n Elevated temperature was associated with increased risk for those dying from cardiovascular, respiratory, cerebrovascular, and some specific cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction.\n\n Vulnerable subgroups also included: Black racial/ethnic group, women, those with lower socioeconomic status, and several age groups, particularly the elderly over 65 years of age as well as infants and young children.\n\n\nConclusion\nMany of these outcomes and vulnerable subgroups have only been identified in recent studies and varied by location and study population.\n\n Thus, region-specific policies, especially in urban areas, are vital to the mitigation of heat-related deaths.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2759912","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rupa","surname":"Basu","email":"rbasu@oehha.ca.gov","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The spectrum of illness during heat waves","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s10393-014-0970-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Assessing variability in the impacts of heat on health outcomes in New York City over time, season, and heat-wave duration","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2105/AJPH.2006.102947","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Projecting Heat-Related Mortality Impacts Under a Changing Climate in the New York City Region","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/1476-069x-12-98","date":"2013-10-23","title":"The impact of heat on mortality and morbidity in the Greater Metropolitan Sydney Region: a case crossover analysis","abstract":"Background\nThis study examined the association between unusually high temperature and daily mortality (1997–2007) and hospital admissions (1997–2010) in the Sydney Greater Metropolitan Region (GMR) to assist in the development of targeted health programs designed to minimise the public health impact of extreme heat.\n\n\nMethods\nSydney GMR was categorized into five climate zones.\n\n Heat-events were defined as severe or extreme.\n\n Using a time-stratified case-crossover design with a conditional logistic regression model we adjusted for influenza epidemics, public holidays, and climate zone.\n\n Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for associations between daily mortality and hospital admissions with heat-event days compared to non-heat event days for single and three day heat-events.\n\n\nResults\nAll-cause mortality overall had similar magnitude associations with single day and three day extreme and severe events as did all cardiovascular mortality.\n\n Respiratory mortality was associated with single day and three day severe events (95thpercentile, lag0: OR?=?1.14;

Massachusetts Case Study","abstract":"We outline a framework for evaluating food- and water-borne surveillance systems using hospitalization records, and demonstrate the approach using data on salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis and giardiasis in persons aged ?65 years in Massachusetts.\n For each infection, and for each reporting jurisdiction, we generated smoothed standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) and surveillance to hospitalization ratios (SHR) by comparing observed surveillance counts with expected values or the number of hospitalized cases, respectively.\n We examined the spatial distribution of SHR and related this to the mean for the entire state.\n Through this approach municipalities that deviated from the typical experience were identified and suspected of under-reporting.\n Regression analysis revealed that SHR was a significant predictor of SMR, after adjusting for population age-structure.\n This confirms that the spatial “signal” depicted by surveillance is in part influenced by inconsistent testing and reporting practices since municipalities that reported fewer cases relative to the number of hospitalizations had a lower relative risk (as estimated by SMR).\n Periodic assessment of SHR has potential in assessing the performance of surveillance systems.\n","id":"PMC3989214","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Siobhan

hospitalizations from winter migration of older adults: A spatiotemporal analysis","abstract":"Background\nDespite advances in surveillance and prevention, pneumonia and influenza (P&amp;I) remain among the leading causes of mortality in the United States.\n\n Elderly adults experience the most severe morbidity from influenza-associated diseases, and have the highest rates of seasonal migration within the U.\n\nS.\n\n compared to other subpopulations.\n\n The objective of this study is to assess spatiotemporal patterns in influenza-associated hospitalizations in the elderly, by time, geography, and intensity of P&amp;I.\n\n Given the high seasonal migration of individuals to Florida, this state was examined more closely using harmonic regression to assess spatial and temporal patterns of P&amp;I hospitalizations by state of residence.\n\n\nMethods\nData containing all Medicare-eligible hospitalizations in the United States for 1991-2006 with P&amp;I (ICD-9-CM codes 480-487) were abstracted for the 65+ population.\n\n Hospitalizations were classified by state of residence, provider state, and date of admissions, specifically comparing those admitted between October and March to those admitted between April and September.\n\n We then compared the hospitalization profile data of Florida residents with that of out-of-state residents by state of primary residence and time of year (in-season or out-of-season).\n\n\nResults\nWe observed distinct seasonal patterns of nonresident P&amp;I hospitalizations, especially comparing typical winter destination states, such as California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida, to other states.\n\n Although most other states generally experienced a higher proportion of non-resident P&amp;I during the summer months (April-September), these states had higher nonresident P&amp;I during the traditional peak influenza season (October-March).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study is among the first to quantify spatiotemporal P&amp;I hospitalization patterns in the elderly, focusing on the change of patterns that are possibly due to seasonal population migration.\n\n Understanding migration and influenza-associated disease patterns in this vulnerable population is critical to prepare for and potentially prevent influenza outbreaks in this vulnerable population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3128025","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kenneth

Synchronization of Influenza in the United States Older Adult Population","abstract":"Background\nIn temperate regions, influenza epidemics occur annually with the highest activity occurring during the winter months.\n\n While seasonal dynamics of the influenza virus, such as time of onset and circulating strains, are well documented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Influenza Surveillance System, an accurate prediction of timing, magnitude, and composition of circulating strains of seasonal influenza remains elusive.\n\n To facilitate public health preparedness for seasonal influenza and to obtain better insights into the spatiotemporal behavior of emerging strains, it is important to develop measurable characteristics of seasonal oscillation and to quantify the relationships between those parameters on a spatial scale.\n\n The objectives of our research were to examine the seasonality of influenza on a national and state level as well as the relationship between peak timing and intensity of influenza in the United States older adult population.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nA total of 248,889 hospitalization records were extracted from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the influenza seasons 1991–2004. Harmonic regression models were used to quantify the peak timing and absolute intensity for each of the 48 contiguous states and Washington, DC.\n\n We found that individual influenza seasons showed spatial synchrony with consistent late or early timing occurring across all 48 states during each influenza season in comparison to the overall average.\n\n On a national level, seasons that had an earlier peak also had higher rates of influenza (rs?=??0.5).\n\n We demonstrated a spatial trend in peak timing of influenza; western states such as Nevada, Utah, and California peaked earlier and New England States such as Rhode Island, Maine, and New Hampshire peaked later.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nOur findings suggest that a systematic description of influenza seasonal patterns is a valuable tool for disease surveillance and can facilitate strategies for prevention of severe disease in the vulnerable, older adult population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2855366","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Julia B.","surname":"Wenger","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elena

posttraumatic stress disorder increased self?reported cardiovascular disease risk.\n\n We attempted to replicate these findings using objectively defined cardiovascular disease hospitalizations in the same cohort.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nData for adult World Trade Center Health Registry enrollees residing in New York State on enrollment and no cardiovascular disease history (n=46 346) were linked to a New York State hospital discharge–reporting system.\n\n Follow?up began at Registry enrollment (2003–2004) and ended at the first cerebrovascular or heart disease (HD) hospitalization, death, or December 31, 2010, whichever was earliest.\n\n We used proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) for HD (n=1151) and cerebrovascular disease (n=284) hospitalization during 302 742 person?years of observation (mean follow?up, 6.5 years per person), accounting for other factors including age, race/ethnicity, smoking, and diabetes.\n\n An elevated risk of HD hospitalization was observed among women (AHR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.71) but not men (AHR 1.16, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.40) with posttraumatic stress disorder at enrollment.\n\n A high overall level of World Trade Center rescue and recovery–related exposure was associated with an elevated HD hospitalization risk in men (AHR 1.82, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.13; P for trend=0.05), but findings in women were inconclusive (AHR 3.29, 95% CI 0.85 to 12.69; P for trend=0.09).\n\n Similar associations were observed specifically with coronary artery disease hospitalization.\n\n Posttraumatic stress disorder increased the cerebrovascular disease hospitalization risk in men but not in women.\n\n\nConclusions\n9/11?related exposures and posttraumatic stress disorder appeared to increase the risk of subsequent hospitalization for HD and cerebrovascular disease.\n\n This is consistent with findings based on self?reported outcomes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3835258","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hannah T.","surname":"Jordan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

of adult-onset asthma incidence among HMO members","abstract":"Background\nHMO databases offer an opportunity for community based epidemiologic studies of asthma incidence, etiology and treatment.\n\n The incidence of asthma in HMO populations and the utility of HMO data, including use of computerized algorithms and manual review of medical charts for determining etiologic factors has not been fully explored.\n\n\nMethods\nWe identified adult-onset asthma, using computerized record searches in a New England HMO.\n\n Monthly, our software applied exclusion and inclusion criteria to identify an 'at-risk' population and 'potential cases'.\n\n Electronic and paper medical records from the past year were then reviewed for each potential case.\n\n Persons with other respiratory diseases or insignificant treatment for asthma were excluded.\n\n\nResults\nThe algorithm was 93 to 99.3% sensitive and 99.6% specific.\n\n Sixty-three percent (n = 469) of potential cases were confirmed as AOA.\n\n Two thirds of confirmed cases were women with an average age of 34.8 (SD 11.8), and 45% had no evidence of previous asthma diagnosis.\n\n The annualized monthly rate of AOA ranged from 4.1 to 11.4 per 1000 at-risk members.\n\n Physicians most commonly attribute asthma to infection (59%) and allergy (14%).\n\n New-onset cases were more likely attributed to infection, while reactivated cases were more associated with allergies.\n\n Medical charts included a discussion of work exposures in relation to asthma in only 32 (7%) cases.\n\n Twenty-three of these (72%) indicated there was an association between asthma and workplace exposures for an overall rate of work-related asthma of 4.9%.\n\n\nConclusion\nComputerized HMO records can be successfully used to identify AOA.\n\n Manual review of these records is important to confirm case status and is useful in evaluation of provider consideration of etiologies.\n\n We demonstrated that clinicians attribute most AOA to infection and tend to ignore the contribution of environmental and occupational exposures.\n\n\n","id":"PMC194432","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Susan

supports research to explicate fundamental biobehavioral dimensions that cut across current heterogeneous disorder categories.\n\n We summarize the rationale, status and long-term goals of RDoC, outline challenges in developing a research classification system (such as construct validity and a suitable process for updating the framework) and discuss seven distinct differences in conception and emphasis from current psychiatric nosologies.\n\n\nSummary\nFuture diagnostic systems cannot reflect ongoing advances in genetics, neuroscience and cognitive science until a literature organized around these disciplines is available to inform the revision efforts.\n\n The goal of the RDoC project is to provide a framework for research to transform the approach to the nosology of mental disorders.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3653747","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Bruce

Attack: A Meta-Analytic Review","abstract":"Background and Purpose\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in survivors of acute life-threatening illness, but little is known about the burden of PTSD in survivors of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA).\n\n This study estimated the prevalence of stroke or TIA-induced posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n\nMethods\nPotentially relevant peer-reviewed journal articles were identified by searching the Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PILOTS Database, The Cochrane Library and Scopus from inception to January 2013; all searches were conducted on January 31, 2013. Observational cohort studies that assessed PTSD with specific reference to a stroke or TIA that occurred at least 1 month prior to the PTSD assessment were included.\n\n PTSD rates and characteristics of the study and sample were abstracted from all included studies.\n\n The coding of all articles included demographics, sample size, study country, and method and timing of PTSD assessment.\n\n\nResults\nNine studies (N?=?1,138) met our inclusion criteria.\n\n PTSD rates varied significantly across studies by timing of PTSD assessment (i.\n\ne.\n\n, within 1 year of stroke/TIA versus greater than 1 year post-stroke/TIA; 55% of heterogeneity explained; Q\n1?=?10.30; P?=?.\n\n001).\n\n Using a random effects model, the estimated rate of PTSD following stroke or TIA was 23% (95% CI, 16%–33%) within 1 year of the stroke or TIA and 11% (95% CI, 8%–14%) after 1 year.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough PTSD is commonly thought to be triggered by external events such as combat or sexual assault, these results suggest that 1 in 4 stroke or TIA survivors develop significant PTSD symptoms due to the stroke or TIA.\n\n Screening for PTSD in a large population-based prospective cohort study with cardiovascular outcome assessments is needed to yield definitive prevalence, and determine whether stroke or TIA-induced PTSD is a risk factor for subsequent cardiovascular events or mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3686746","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Donald","surname":"Edmondson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Safiya","surname":"Richardson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jennifer

cardiovascular disease and mortality; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.\n\n We hypothesized that patients with PTSD would exhibit endothelial dysfunction, a potential mechanism involved in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nA total of 214 outpatients treated at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center underwent tests of endothelial function and evaluation for PTSD.\n\n Flow?mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery was performed to assess endothelial function, and current PTSD status was defined by the PTSD Checklist, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition), with a score ?40. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the association between PTSD status and endothelial function.\n\n Patients with PTSD (n=67) were more likely to be male (99% versus 91%, P=0.04) and to have depression (58% versus 8%, P&lt;0.0001) and were less likely to be on an angiotensin?converting enzyme inhibitor (17% versus 36%, P=0.007) or ??blocker treatment (25% versus 41%, P=0.03).\n\n Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients with PTSD had significantly lower flow?mediated vasodilation (5.8±3.4% versus 7.5±3.7%; P=0.003); furthermore, lower flow?mediated vasodilation was associated with increasing age (P=0.008), decreasing estimated glomerular filtration rate (P=0.003), hypertension (P=0.002), aspirin (P=0.03), and ??blocker treatments (P=0.01).\n\n In multivariable analysis, PTSD remained independently associated with lower flow?mediated vasodilation (P=0.0005).\n\n\nConclusions\nAfter adjusting for demographic, comorbidity, and treatment characteristics, PTSD remained associated with worse endothelial function in an outpatient population.\n\n Whether poor endothelial function contributes to the higher risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with PTSD deserves further study.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4943274","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"S.

cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\n Biopsychosocial factors associated with PTSD likely account for some or all of this association.\n\n We determined whether 1, or a combination of comorbid conditions explained the association between PTSD and incident CVD.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nEligible patients used 1 of 5 Veterans Health Affairs medical centers distributed across the United States.\n\n Data were obtained from electronic health records.\n\n At index date, 2519 Veterans Health Affairs (VA) patients, 30 to 70 years of age, had PTSD diagnoses and 1659 did not.\n\n Patients had no CVD diagnoses for 12 months before index date.\n\n Patients could enter the cohort between 2008 and 2012 with follow?up until 2015. Age?adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were computed before and after adjusting for comorbidities.\n\n Patients were middle aged (mean=50.1 years, SD±11.0), mostly male (87.0%), and 60% were white.\n\n The age?adjusted association between PTSD and incident CVD was significant (hazard ratio=1.41; 95% CI: 1.21–1.63).\n\n After adjustment for metabolic conditions, the association between PTSD and incident CVD was attenuated but remained significant (hazard ratio=1.23; 95% CI: 1.06–1.44).\n\n After additional adjustment for smoking, sleep disorder, substance use disorder, anxiety disorders, and depression, PTSD was not associated with incident CVD (hazard ratio=0.96; 95% CI: 0.81–1.15).\n\n\nConclusions\n\nPTSD is not an independent risk factor for CVD.\n\n Physical and psychiatric conditions and smoking that co?occur with PTSD explain why this patient population has an increased risk of CVD.\n\n Careful monitoring may limit exposure to CVD risk factors and subsequent incident CVD.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6405681","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jeffrey F.","surname":"Scherrer","email":"scherrjf@slu.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joanne","surname":"Salas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Beth E.","surname":"Cohen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paula P.","surname":"Schnurr","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"F.

guidelines for PTSD, which are a set of recommendations for providers who treat individuals with PTSD.\n The purpose of the current review article is to briefly review the methodology used in each set of 2017 guidelines and then discuss the psychological treatments of PTSD for adults that were strongly recommended by both sets of guidelines.\n Both guidelines strongly recommended use of Prolonged Exposure (PE), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n Each of these treatments has a large evidence base and is trauma-focused, which means they directly address memories of the traumatic event or thoughts and feelings related to the traumatic event.\n Finally, we will discuss implications and future

Diabetes","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the health of individuals with diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nThis was an observational study in 1,795 adults with an A1C measurement 6 months before and 6?16 months after Hurricane Katrina in three health care systems: private (Tulane University Hospital and Clinic [TUHC]), state (Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans [MCLNO]), and Veterans Affairs (VA).\n\n Glycemic control (A1C), blood pressure, and lipids before the hurricane were compared with the patients' first measurement thereafter.\n\n The CORE Diabetes Model was used to project life expectancy and health economic impact.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean predisaster A1C levels differed between MCLNO and VA patients (mean 7.7 vs.\n\n 7.3%, P &lt; 0.001) and increased significantly among MCLNO patients to 8.3% (P &lt; 0.001) but not among VA and TUHC patients.\n\n Mean systolic blood pressure increased in all three systems (130–137.6 mmHg for TUHC and 130.7–143.7 for VA, P &lt; 0.001; 132–136 for MCLNO, P = 0.008).\n\n Mean LDL cholesterol increased in the VA (97.1–104.3 mg/dl) and TUHC patients (103.4–115.5; P &lt; 0.001).\n\n Hurricane Katrina increased modeled direct, indirect, and total health care costs and also reduced life expectancy as well as quality-adjusted life expectancy, with the economic impact being quite substantial because of the large population size affected.\n\n We estimate a lifetime cost of USD $504 million for the adult population affected, with the largest economic impact seen among MCLNO patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA major disaster had a significant effect on diabetes management and exacerbated existing disparities.\n\n These effects may have a lasting impact on both health and economic implications.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2732170","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Vivian

evidence from Hanoi, Vietnam","abstract":"Background\nVietnam is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world.\n\n The country suffers from many kinds of natural disasters, of which the most common and serious one is flooding.\n\n Long and heavy rainfall during the last days of October and the first week of November 2008 resulted in a devastating flood unseen for over three decades in the capital city of Hanoi.\n\n It caused a substantial health impact on residents in and around the city and compromised the capacity of local health services.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study is to ascertain the vulnerability and health impacts of the devastating flood in Hanoi by identifying the differences in mortality, injuries, and morbidity patterns (dengue, pink eye, dermatitis, psychological problems, and hypertension) between flood affected and non-affected households.\n\n\nDesign\nA cross-sectional study was carried out involving 871 households in four selected communes (two heavily flood affected and two comparatively less affected) from two severely flooded districts of Hanoi.\n\n Participants were interviewed and information collected on the social, economic, and health impacts of the devastation within 1 month after the flood.\n\n\nResults\nThe self-reported number of deaths and injuries reported in this study within 1 month after the heavy rainfall were a bit higher in severely affected communes as compared to that of the less affected communes of our study.\n\n The findings showed higher incidences of dengue fever, pink eye, dermatitis, and psychological problems in communes severely affected by flood as compared to that of the controlled communes.\n\n\nConclusions\nFor people in flood prone areas (at risk for flooding), flood prevention and mitigation strategies need to be seriously thought through and acted upon, as these people are exposed to greater health problems such as psychological issues and communicable diseases such as pink eye or dermatitis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3160808","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tran

and precipitation response to greenhouse gas forcing","abstract":"id='Par1'>As evidence of climate change strengthens, knowledge of its regional implications becomes an urgent need for decision making.\n Current understanding of regional precipitation changes is substantially limited by our understanding of the atmospheric circulation response to climate change, which to a high degree remains uncertain.\n This uncertainty is reflected in the wide spread in atmospheric circulation changes projected in multimodel ensembles, which cannot be directly interpreted in a probabilistic sense.\n The uncertainty can instead be represented by studying a discrete set of physically plausible storylines of atmospheric circulation changes.\n By mining CMIP5 model output, here we take this broader perspective and develop storylines for Southern Hemisphere (SH) midlatitude circulation changes, conditioned on the degree of global-mean warming, based on the climate responses of two remote drivers: the enhanced warming of the tropical upper troposphere and the strengthening of the stratospheric polar vortex.\n For the three continental domains in the SH, we analyse the precipitation changes under each storyline.\n To allow comparison with previous studies, we also link both circulation and precipitation changes with those of the Southern Annular Mode.\n Our results show that the response to tropical warming leads to a strengthening of the midlatitude westerly winds, whilst the response to a delayed breakdown (for DJF) or strengthening (for JJA) of the stratospheric vortex leads to a poleward shift of the westerly winds and the storm tracks.\n However, the circulation response is not zonally symmetric and the regional precipitation storylines for South America, South Africa, South of Australia and New Zealand exhibit quite specific dependencies on the two remote drivers, which are not well represented by changes in the Southern Annular Mode.\n","id":"PMC7250812","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Julia","surname":"Mindlin","email":"julia.mindlin@cima.fcen.edu.ar","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Theodore

moreover, depth and frictional changes affect tide, surge, and wave characteristics, altering the relative importance of other risk factors.\n Consequently, sea-level driven changes in wave characteristics, and to a lesser extent, tides, amplify the resulting design heights by an average of 48–56%, relative to design changes caused by SLR alone.\n Since many of the world’s most vulnerable coastlines are impacted by depth-limited waves, our results suggest that the overall influence of SLR may be greatly underestimated in many regions.\n","id":"PMC5216410","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Arne","surname":"Arns","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sönke","surname":"Dangendorf?","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jürgen","surname":"Jensen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Talke","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jens","surname":"Bender","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charitha","surname":"Pattiaratchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/2017GL075963","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tidal response to sea-level rise in different types of estuaries: the importance of length, bathymetry, and geometry","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/2010JCLI3520.1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Interpreting century-scale changes in southern North Sea storm surge climate derived from coupled model simulations","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2011.09.005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Changing North Sea storm surge climate: an increasing hazard?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.02.006","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Long-term changes in sea-level components in Latin America and the Caribbean","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0553.1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Projected significant increase in the number of extreme extratropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00382-014-2426-8","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Extratropical cyclones and the projected decline of winter Mediterranean precipitation in the CMIP5 models","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/1520-0493(1995)123&lt;3458:FTOTUS&gt;2.0.CO;2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Feature tracking on the unit sphere","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/1520-0493(1999)127&lt;1362:ACFFT&gt;2.0.CO;2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Adaptive constraints for feature tracking","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/1520-0469(2002)059&lt;1041:NPOTNH&gt;2.0.CO;2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"New perspectives on the Northern Hemisphere winter storm tracks","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/2009BAMS2755.1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The international best track archive for climate stewardship (IBTrACS) unifying tropical cyclone data","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/1520-0493(1996)124&lt;2914:SNEATT&gt;2.0.CO;2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Spherical nonparametric estimators applied to the UGAMP model integration for AMIP","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.coastaleng.2007.05.007","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A multivariate model of sea storms using copulas","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00477-014-0916-1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Dismissing return periods!","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1029/2009WR008388","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A comparative copula-based bivariate frequency analysis of observed and simulated storm events: a case study on Bartlett-Lewis modeled rainfall","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Schepsmeier, U. et al.

Epidemiological and laboratory findings","abstract":"Introduction\nIn October 2017, a blood sample from a resident of Kween District, Eastern Uganda, tested positive for Marburg virus.\n\n Within 24 hour of confirmation, a rapid outbreak response was initiated.\n\n Here, we present results of epidemiological and laboratory investigations.\n\n\nMethods\nA district task force was activated consisting of specialised teams to conduct case finding, case management and isolation, contact listing and follow up, sample collection and testing, and community engagement.\n\n An ecological investigation was also carried out to identify the potential source of infection.\n\n Virus isolation and Next Generation sequencing were performed to identify the strain of Marburg virus.\n\n\nResults\nSeventy individuals (34 MVD suspected cases and 36 close contacts of confirmed cases) were epidemiologically investigated, with blood samples tested for MVD.\n\n Only four cases met the MVD case definition; one was categorized as a probable case while the other three were confirmed cases.\n\n A total of 299 contacts were identified; during follow- up, two were confirmed as MVD.\n\n Of the four confirmed and probable MVD cases, three died, yielding a case fatality rate of 75%.\n\n All four cases belonged to a single family and 50% (2/4) of the MVD cases were female.\n\n All confirmed cases had clinical symptoms of fever, vomiting, abdominal pain and bleeding from body orifices.\n\n Viral sequences indicated that the Marburg virus strain responsible for this outbreak was closely related to virus strains previously shown to be circulating in Uganda.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis outbreak of MVD occurred as a family cluster with no additional transmission outside of the four related cases.\n\n Rapid case detection, prompt laboratory testing at the Uganda National VHF Reference Laboratory and presence of pre-trained, well-prepared national and district rapid response teams facilitated the containment and control of this outbreak within one month, preventing nationwide and global transmission of the disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6438581","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Luke","surname":"Nyakarahuka","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Trevor

instrument for global health security, are designed to prevent and cope with major international public health threats.\n But poor implementation in countries hampers their effectiveness.\n In the wake of a number of major international health crises, such as the 2014 Ebola and 2016 Zika outbreaks, and the findings of a number of high-level assessments of the global response to these crises, it has become clear that there is a need for more joined-up thinking between health system strengthening activities and health security efforts for prevention, alert and response.\n WHO is working directly with its Member States to promote this approach, more specifically around how to better embed the IHR (2005) core capacities into the main health system functions.\n This paper looks at how and where the intersections between the IHR and the health system can be best leveraged towards developing greater health system resilience.\n This merging of approaches is a key component in pursuit of Universal Health Coverage and strengthened global health security as two mutually reinforcing agendas.\n","id":"PMC5783036","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hans","surname":"Kluge","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jose

global preparedness for the next pandemic: development and application of an Epidemic Preparedness Index","abstract":"Introduction\nRobust metrics for national-level preparedness are critical for assessing global resilience to epidemic and pandemic outbreaks.\n\n However, existing preparedness assessments focus primarily on public health systems or specific legislative frameworks, and do not measure other essential capacities that enable and support public health preparedness and response.\n\n\nMethods\nWe developed an Epidemic Preparedness Index (EPI) to assess national-level preparedness.\n\n The EPI is global, covering 188 countries.\n\n It consists of five subindices measuring each country’s economic resources, public health communications, infrastructure, public health systems and institutional capacity.\n\n To evaluate the construct validity of the EPI, we tested its correlation with proxy measures for preparedness and response capacity, including the timeliness of outbreak detection and reporting, as well as vaccination rates during the 2009?H1N1 influenza pandemic.\n\n\nResults\nThe most prepared countries were concentrated in Europe and North America, while the least prepared countries clustered in Central and West Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\n Better prepared countries were found to report infectious disease outbreaks more quickly and to have vaccinated a larger proportion of their population during the 2009 pandemic.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe EPI measures a country’s capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease events.\n\n Existing tools, such as the Joint External Evaluation (JEE), have been designed to measure preparedness within a country over time.\n\n The EPI complements the JEE by providing a holistic view of preparedness and is constructed to support comparative risk assessment between countries.\n\n The index can be updated rapidly to generate global estimates of pandemic preparedness that can inform strategy and resource allocation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6352812","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Oppenheim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Gallivan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Gallivan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nita
