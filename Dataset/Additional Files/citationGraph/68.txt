the complex system of sensors and signaling molecules that make up the host innate immune response.\n Here we show that human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV papain-like proteases (PLP) antagonize innate immune signaling mediated by STING (stimulator of interferon genes, also known as MITA/ERIS/MYPS).\n STING resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and upon activation, forms dimers which assemble with MAVS, TBK-1 and IKK?, leading to IRF-3 activation and subsequent induction of interferon (IFN).\n We found that expression of the membrane anchored PLP domain from human HCoV-NL63 (PLP2-TM) or SARS-CoV (PLpro-TM) inhibits STING-mediated activation of IRF-3 nuclear translocation and induction of IRF-3 dependent promoters.\n Both catalytically active and inactive forms of CoV PLPs co-immunoprecipitated with STING, and viral replicase proteins co-localize with STING in HCoV-NL63-infected cells.\n Ectopic expression of catalytically active PLP2-TM blocks STING dimer formation and negatively regulates assembly of STING-MAVS-TBK1/IKK? complexes required for activation of IRF-3. STING dimerization was also substantially reduced in cells infected with SARS-CoV.\n Furthermore, the level of ubiquitinated forms of STING, RIG-I, TBK1 and IRF-3 are reduced in cells expressing wild type or catalytic mutants of PLP2-TM, likely contributing to disruption of signaling required for IFN induction.\n These results describe a new mechanism used by CoVs in which CoV PLPs negatively regulate antiviral defenses by disrupting the STING-mediated IFN

aspects of the morbidity and mortality characterizing infection with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated coronavirus-2, the etiologic agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n We examined skin and lung tissues from 5 patients with severe COVID-19 characterized by respiratory failure (n= 5) and purpuric skin rash (n?=?3).\n COVID-19 pneumonitis was predominantly a pauci-inflammatory septal capillary injury with significant septal capillary mural and luminal fibrin deposition and permeation of the interalveolar septa by neutrophils.\n No viral cytopathic changes were observed and the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membranes, inflammation, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hallmarks of classic acute respiratory distress syndrome, were not prominent.\n These pulmonary findings were accompanied by significant deposits of terminal complement components C5b-9 (membrane attack complex), C4d, and mannose binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)2, in the microvasculature, consistent with sustained, systemic activation of the complement pathways.\n The purpuric skin lesions similarly showed a pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy, with deposition of C5b-9 and C4d in both grossly involved and normally-appearing skin.\n In addition, there was co-localization of COVID-19 spike glycoproteins with C4d and C5b-9 in the interalveolar septa and the cutaneous microvasculature of 2 cases examined.\n In conclusion, at least a subset of sustained, severe COVID-19 may define a type of catastrophic

unique opportunity for the study of human responses to a novel virus.\n\n We have previously reported that dendritic cells (DCs) might be involved in the immune escape mechanisms for SARS-CoV.\n\n In this study, we focussed on the gene expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), chemokine receptors (CCRs) and death receptor ligands in SARS-CoV infected DCs.\n\n We also compared adult and cord blood (CB) DCs to find a possible explanation for the age-dependent severity of SARS.\n\n\nResults\nOur results demonstrates that SARS-CoV did not modulate TLR-1 to TLR-10 gene expression but significantly induced the expression of CCR-1, CCR-3, and CCR-5. There was also strong induction of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), but not Fas ligand gene expression in SARS-CoV infected DCs.\n\n Interestingly, the expressions of most genes studied were higher in CB DCs than adult DCs.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe upregulation of chemokines and CCRs may facilitate DC migration from the infection site to the lymph nodes, whereas the increase of TRAIL may induce lymphocyte apoptosis.\n\n These findings may explain the increased lung infiltrations and lymphoid depletion in SARS patients.\n\n Further explorations of the biological significance of these findings are warranted.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2700820","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Helen KW","surname":"Law","email":"hkwlaw@hkucc.hku.hk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chung Yan","surname":"Cheung","email":"chungey@hkucc.hku.hk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sin Fun","surname":"Sia","email":"sfsia@hkucc.hku.hk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuk On","surname":"Chan","email":"tyochan@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"JS Malik","surname":"Peiris","email":"malik@hku.hk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu Lung","surname":"Lau","email":"lauylung@hkucc.hku.hk","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Role of dendritic cells in SARS coronavirus infection","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.4049/jimmunol174127977","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome and the innate immune responses: modulation of effector cell function without productive infection","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/jvirol201402018","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Productive replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in monocyte-derived dendritic cells modulates innate immune response","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.abc6261","date":"2020-08-04","title":"Systems biological assessment of immunity to mild versus severe COVID-19 infection in humans","abstract":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected millions of people globally, yet how the human immune system responds to and influences COVID-19 severity remains unclear.\n Mathew et al.\n present a comprehensive atlas of immune modulation associated with COVID-19.

associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders.\n To better understand the potential role of neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in hospitalized patients and determined its relationship to severity of illness and respiratory status.\n Patients with COVID-19 (n = 172) had markedly elevated levels of calprotectin in their blood.\n Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened.\n When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n = 94 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (8039 ± 7031 ng/ml, n = 32) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3365 ± 3146, P &lt; 0.0001).\n In summary, serum calprotectin levels track closely with current and future COVID-19 severity,

decreased rapidly.\n\n On the 20th day of admission, the nucleic acid test was negative, WBC, neutrophil, CRP, NLR and PLR decreased gradually, and monocyte, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts increased.\n\n Although RBCs and hemoglobin (Hb) levels continued to decrease, RDW gradually increased, indicating the recovery of hematopoiesis.\n\n In addition, it should be noted that monocytes and eosinophils were at extremely low levels within 10 days after admission; the recovery time of eosinophils was approximately 12 days after admission, which was earlier than other parameters, which might be of great value in judging the progress of the disease.\n\n\nConclusions\nDynamic changes in routine blood parameters might be helpful for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and evaluation of the treatment effect.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7217800","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Guoguang","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wang","email":"loganhaha@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jaci.2020.05.003","date":"2020-05-05","title":"Longitudinal

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain largely unclear.\n\n\nObjective\nWe sought to address the dynamic changes in hematologic and immunologic biomarkers and their associations with severity and outcomes of COVID-19.\nMethods\nA retrospective study including 548 patients with COVID-19 with clarified outcome (discharged or deceased) from a national cohort in China was performed.\n\n Cross-sectional and longitudinal variations were compared and the associations with different severity and outcomes were analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nOn admission, the counts of lymphocytes, T-cell subsets, eosinophils, and platelets decreased markedly, especially in severe/critical and fatal patients.\n\n Increased neutrophil count and neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio were predominant in severe/critical cases or nonsurvivors.\n\n During hospitalization, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and platelets showed an increasing trend in survivors, but maintained lower levels or dropped significantly afterwards in nonsurvivors.\n\n Nonsurvivors kept a high level or showed an upward trend for neutrophils, IL-6, procalcitonin, D-dimer, amyloid A protein, and C-reactive protein, which were kept stable or showed a downward trend in survivors.\n\n Positive correlation between CD8+ T-cell and lymphocytes count was found in survivors but not in nonsurvivors.\n\n A multivariate Cox regression model suggested that restored levels of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and platelets could serve as predictors for recovery, whereas progressive increases in neutrophils, basophils, and IL-6 were associated with fatal outcome.\n\n\nConclusions\nHematologic and immunologic impairment showed a significantly different profile between survivors and nonsurvivors in patients with COVID-19 with different severity.\n\n The longitudinal variations in these biomarkers could serve to predict recovery or fatal

cells are well accepted as important sentinel cells for host defence against selected pathogens.\n Their location at mucosal surfaces and ability to mobilize multiple aspects of early immune responses makes them critical contributors to effective immunity in several experimental settings.\n However, the interactions of mast cells with viruses and pathogen products are complex and can have both detrimental and positive impacts.\n There is substantial evidence for mast cell mobilization and activation of effector cells and mobilization of dendritic cells following viral challenge.\n These cells are a major and under-appreciated local source of type I and III interferons following viral challenge.\n However, mast cells have also been implicated in inappropriate inflammatory responses, long term fibrosis, and vascular leakage associated with viral infections.\n Progress in combating infection and boosting effective immunity requires a better understanding of mast cell responses to viral infection and the pathogen products and receptors we can employ to modify such responses.\n In this review, we outline some of the key known responses of mast cells to viral infection and their major responses to pathogen products.\n We have placed an emphasis on data obtained from human mast cells and aim to provide a framework for considering the complex interactions between mast cells and pathogens with a view to exploiting this knowledge therapeutically.\n Long-lived resident mast cells and their responses to viruses and pathogen products provide excellent opportunities to modify local immune responses that remain to be fully exploited in cancer immunotherapy, vaccination, and treatment of infectious

COVID-19","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented sanitary threat.\n In the absence of specific vaccines and anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, medicines that may assist in tackling the emergency and limiting the high number of fatalities are urgently needed.\n The repositioning of available drugs to treat COVID-19 is the only and rapid option in the face of the lack of direct antiviral agents and vaccines available.\n In this light it is important to focus on available drugs, which, based on their pharmacodynamics, could plausibly attenuate viral growth as well as COVID-19’s worst complications.\n This is the case of chloroquine and tocilizumab which seem to limit virus replication and the severity of interstitial pneumonia, respectively.\n However, these treatments, particularly those aimed at containing inflammation, are still reserved for the most severe cases.\n This commentary elaborates on the pharmacological rationale of repositioning the mast cell stabilizer chromones as an adjunctive treatment for SARS?CoV?2 infection, and proposes their practical clinical testing as an early, safe, and cost-effective anti-inflammatory intervention in COVID-19 to limit the eventual secondary progression toward life-threatening respiratory

by a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n The SARS epidemic in 2003 resulted in more than 8400 SARS cases and approximately 800 deaths.\n Existing in non?identified animal reservoirs, SARS?CoV continues to represent a threat to humans although more than four years have passed since a large outbreak of SARS, and no new cases have been reported.\n However, we cannot exclude the possibility of reemergence of SARS.\n It is hence necessary to understand the biology of the SARS?CoV to deal adequately with the next outbreak, whenever it happens.\n The SARS?CoV is a novel coronavirus with a large (?30 thousand nucleotides) positive?sense, single?stranded RNA containing 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs) of which 2 large ORFs constitute the replicase gene which encodes proteins required for viral RNA syntheses.\n The remaining 12 ORFs encode the 4 structural proteins: spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope; and eight accessory proteins.\n The viral genome and its expression within the host cell undergoes extensive translational and enzymatic processing to form the 4 structural, 8 accessory and 16 nonstructural proteins.\n In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms or capsid assembly and viral pathogenesis, laboratories around the world have adopted a variety of approaches to answering these trivial questions.\n It has been our effort to consolidate all information known to date about the molecular mechanisms of the SARS?CoV into this chapter to update our readership on the current status of research.\n\n","id":"PMC7168024","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"NAMITA","surname":"SATIJA","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"SUNIL

Another 23 nucleotide and 13 amino acid differences located in 9 different proteins, including positions of B and T cell epitopes, were found between viruses from the first and second

deaths, posing a serious threat to human health.\n Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine.\n Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of

6.3 nM).\n The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD.\n These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections.\n Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.\ng.\n m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact

At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment.\n In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed.\n Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral

efficacious.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days.\n\n The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo).\n\n Those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 11), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 18) among those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.49; P&lt;0.001, by a log-rank test).\n\n In an analysis that used a proportional-odds model with an eight-category ordinal scale, the patients who received remdesivir were found to be more likely than those who received placebo to have clinical improvement at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9, after adjustment for actual disease severity).\n\n The Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% with remdesivir and 15.2% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03).\n\n Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received remdesivir (24.6%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6%).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data show that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with

A Changing Ecosystem across Age, Environment, Diet, and Diseases","abstract":"Each individual is provided with a unique gut microbiota profile that plays many specific functions in host nutrient metabolism, maintenance of structural integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, immunomodulation, and protection against pathogens.\n Gut microbiota are composed of different bacteria species taxonomically classified by genus, family, order, and phyla.\n Each human’s gut microbiota are shaped in early life as their composition depends on infant transitions (birth gestational date, type of delivery, methods of milk feeding, weaning period) and external factors such as antibiotic use.\n These personal and healthy core native microbiota remain relatively stable in adulthood but differ between individuals due to enterotypes, body mass index (BMI) level, exercise frequency, lifestyle, and cultural and dietary habits.\n Accordingly, there is not a unique optimal gut microbiota composition since it is different for each individual.\n However, a healthy host–microorganism balance must be respected in order to optimally perform metabolic and immune functions and prevent disease development.\n This review will provide an overview of the studies that focus on gut microbiota balances in the same individual and between individuals and highlight the close mutualistic relationship between gut microbiota variations and diseases.\n Indeed, dysbiosis of gut microbiota is associated not only with intestinal disorders but also with numerous extra-intestinal diseases such as metabolic and neurological disorders.\n Understanding the cause or consequence of these gut microbiota balances in health and disease and how to maintain or restore a healthy gut microbiota composition should be useful in developing promising therapeutic interventions.\n","id":"PMC6351938","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emanuele","surname":"Rinninella","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pauline","surname":"Raoul","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Pauline","surname":"Raoul","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marco","surname":"Cintoni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francesco","surname":"Franceschi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Francesco","surname":"Franceschi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giacinto

Time of Hospitalization","abstract":"Background &amp; Aims\nAlthough severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects gastrointestinal tissues, little is known about the roles of gut commensal microbes in susceptibility to and severity of infection.\n\n We investigated changes in fecal microbiomes of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and associations with severity and fecal shedding of virus.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses of fecal samples from 15 patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, from February 5 through March 17, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 or 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge; disease was categorized as mild (no radiographic evidence of pneumonia), moderate (pneumonia was present), severe (respiratory rate ?30/min, or oxygen saturation ?93% when breathing ambient air), or critical (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or organ failure requiring intensive care).\n\n We compared microbiome data with those from 6 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 15 healthy individuals (controls).\n\n We assessed gut microbiome profiles in association with disease severity and changes in fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2.\nResults\nPatients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in fecal microbiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of opportunistic pathogens and depletion of beneficial commensals, at time of hospitalization and at all timepoints during hospitalization.\n\n Depleted symbionts and gut dysbiosis persisted even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (determined from throat swabs) and resolution of respiratory symptoms.\n\n The baseline abundance of Coprobacillus, Clostridium ramosum, and Clostridium hathewayi correlated with COVID-19 severity; there was an inverse correlation between abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (an anti-inflammatory bacterium) and disease severity.\n\n Over the course of hospitalization, Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides massiliensis, and Bacteroides ovatus, which downregulate expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in murine gut, correlated inversely with SARS-CoV-2 load in fecal samples from patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn a pilot study of 15 patients with COVID-19, we found persistent alterations in the fecal microbiome during the time of hospitalization, compared with controls.\n\n Fecal microbiota alterations were associated with fecal levels of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity.\n\n Strategies to alter the intestinal microbiota might reduce disease severity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7237927","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Zuo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Grace

and postmenopausal condition leading to bone loss and fragility.\n Probiotics have been associated with various immunomodulatory properties and have the potential to ameliorate several inflammatory conditions including osteoporosis.\n Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) was selected as probiotic of choice in our present study due its common availability and established immunomodulatory properties.\n In the present study, we report for the first time that administration of LA in ovariectomized (ovx) mice enhances both trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture along with increasing the mineral density and heterogeneity of bones.\n This effect of LA administration is due to its immunomodulatory effect on host immune system.\n LA thus skews the Treg-Th17 cell balance by inhibiting osteoclastogenic Th17 cells and promoting anti-osteoclastogenic Treg cells in ovx mice.\n LA administration also suppressed expression of osteoclastogenic factors (IL-6, IL-17, TNF-? and RANKL) and increased expression of anti-osteoclastogenic factors (IL-10, IFN-?).\n Taken together the present study for the first time clearly demonstrates the therapeutic potential of LA as an osteo-protective agent in enhancing bone health (via tweaking Treg-Th17 cell balance) in postmenopausal osteoporosis.\n","id":"PMC6019967","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hamid

The present study reviewed the effects of probiotics and synbiotics on intestinal chronic diseases in in vitro, animal, and human studies, particularly in randomized clinical trials.\n The selected probiotics exhibit in vitro anti-inflammatory properties.\n Probiotic strains and cell-free supernatants reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines via action that is principally mediated by toll-like receptors.\n Probiotic administration improved the clinical symptoms, histological alterations, and mucus production in most of the evaluated animal studies, but some results suggest that caution should be taken when administering these agents in the relapse stages of IBD.\n In addition, no effects on chronic enteropathies were reported.\n Probiotic supplementation appears to be potentially well tolerated, effective, and safe in patients with IBD, in both CD and UC.\n Indeed, probiotics such as Bifidobacterium longum 536 improved the clinical symptoms in patients with mild to moderate active UC.\n Although it has been proposed that probiotics can provide benefits in certain conditions, the risks and benefits should be carefully assessed before initiating any therapy in patients with IBD.\n For this reason, further studies are required to understand the precise mechanism by which probiotics and synbiotics affect these

transcription repressor—both may enhance target gene (ACE2 or TMPRSS2) expression in the relevant target tissues.\n SNPs that are abundant in the more resistant populations may invalidate BSs for a transcriptional repressor or they may introduce BSs for a transcriptional repressor or initiator of mRNA degradation, which may reduce target gene expression levels.\n This aspect, when added to the

from Italy and 775 patients and 950 control participants from Spain were included in the final analysis.\n\n In total, we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and conducted a meta-analysis of the two case–control panels.\n\n\nResults\nWe detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at locus 3p21.31 and with rs657152 at locus 9q34.2, which were significant at the genomewide level (P&lt;5×10?8) in the meta-analysis of the two case–control panels (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11; P=1.15×10?10; and odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.47; P=4.95×10?8, respectively).\n\n At locus 3p21.31, the association signal spanned the genes SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6 and XCR1.\n\n The association signal at locus 9q34.2 coincided with the ABO blood group locus; in this cohort, a blood-group–specific analysis showed a higher risk in blood group A than in other blood groups (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.75; P=1.48×10?4) and a protective effect in blood group O as compared with other blood groups (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79; P=1.06×10?5).\n\n\nConclusions\nWe identified a 3p21.31 gene cluster as a genetic susceptibility locus in patients with Covid-19 with respiratory failure and confirmed a potential involvement of the ABO blood-group system.\n\n (Funded by Stein Erik Hagen and

immunity and inflammation in ageing: a key for understanding age-related diseases","abstract":"The process of maintaining life for the individual is a constant struggle to preserve his/her integrity.\n This can come at a price when immunity is involved, namely systemic inflammation.\n Inflammation is not per se a negative phenomenon: it is the response of the immune system to the invasion of viruses or bacteria and other pathogens.\n During evolution the human organism was set to live 40 or 50 years; today, however, the immune system must remain active for much a longer time.\n This very long activity leads to a chronic inflammation that slowly but inexorably damages one or several organs: this is a typical phenomenon linked to ageing and it is considered the major risk factor for age-related chronic diseases.\n Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes and even sarcopenia and cancer, just to mention a few – have an important inflammatory component, though disease progression seems also dependent on the genetic background of individuals.\n Emerging evidence suggests that pro-inflammatory genotypes are related to unsuccessful ageing, and, reciprocally, controlling inflammatory status may allow a better chance of successful ageing.\n In other words, age-related diseases are 'the price we pay' for a life-long active immune system: this system has also the potential to harm us later, as its fine tuning becomes compromised.\n Our immune system has evolved to control pathogens, so pro-inflammatory responses are likely to be evolutionarily programmed to resist fatal infections with pathogens aggressively.\n Thus, inflammatory genotypes are an important and necessary part of the normal host responses to pathogens in early life, but the overproduction of inflammatory molecules might also cause immune-related inflammatory diseases and eventually death later.\n Therefore, low responder genotypes involved in regulation of innate defence mechanisms, might better control inflammatory responses and age-related disease development, resulting in an increased chance of long life survival in a 'permissive' environment with reduced pathogen load, medical care and increased quality of life.\n","id":"PMC1166571","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Federico","surname":"Licastro","email":"licastro@alma.unibo.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giuseppina","surname":"Candore","email":"gcandore@unipa.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Domenico","surname":"Lio","email":"dolio@unipa.it","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Elisa","surname":"Porcellini","email":"elisa_porcellini@yahoo.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giuseppina","surname":"Colonna-Romano","email":"gcolonna@unipa.it","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Claudio","surname":"Franceschi","email":"claudio.franceschi@unibo.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Calogero","surname":"Caruso","email":"marcoc@unipa.it","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.arr.2021.101299","date":"2021-02-12","title":"SARS

that the regional prevalence of specific class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which shape the anti-viral immune response, might partly underlie these differences.\n Through an ecological approach, we analyzed whether a set of HLA alleles (A, B, C), known to be involved in the immune response against infections, correlates with COVID-19 incidence.\n COVID-19 data were provided by the National Civil Protection Department, whereas HLA allele prevalence was retrieved through the Italian Bone-Marrow Donors Registry.\n Among all the alleles, HLA-A*25, B*08, B*44, B*15:01, B*51, C*01, and C*03 showed a positive log-linear correlation with COVID-19 incidence rate fixed on 9 April 2020 in proximity of the national outbreak peak (Pearson’s coefficients between 0.50 and 0.70, p-value &lt; 0.0001), whereas HLA-B*14, B*18, and B*49 showed an inverse log-linear correlation (Pearson’s coefficients between ?0.47 and ?0.59, p-value &lt; 0.0001).\n When alleles were examined simultaneously using a multiple regression model to control for confounding factors, HLA-B*44 and C*01 were still positively and independently associated with COVID-19: a growth rate of 16% (95%CI: 0.1–35%) per 1% point increase in B*44 prevalence; and of 19% (95%CI: 1–41%) per 1% point increase in C*01 prevalence.\n Our epidemiologic analysis, despite the limits of the ecological approach, is strongly suggestive of a permissive role of HLA-C*01 and B*44 towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, which warrants further investigation in case-control studies.\n This study opens a new potential avenue for the identification of sub-populations at risk, which could provide Health Services with a tool to define more targeted clinical management strategies and priorities in vaccination

(OR = 11.182; 95% CI = 1.053–118.700; p = 0.04) or APACHE-II (OR = 17.604; 95% CI = 1.629–190.211; p = 0.02), and the allele HLA-DQB1*04 after controlling for SOFA (OR = 9.963; 95% CI = 1.235–80.358;

properties which expression is induced by type I interferons (IFNs) and are therefore called interferon stimulated genes (ISGs).\n Type I IFNs are produced after viral recognition by pathogen recognition receptors, which trigger a cascade of activation events.\n Human and mouse studies have shown that defective type I IFNs induction may hamper the ability to control viral infections.\n In humans, moderate to high-effect variants have been identified in individuals with particularly severe complications following viral infection.\n In mice, functional studies using knock-out alleles have revealed the specific role of most genes of the IFN pathway.\n Here, we review the role of the molecular partners of the type I IFNs induction pathway and their implication in the control of viral infections and of their complications.\n","id":"PMC7677911","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marie","surname":"Bourdon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caroline","surname":"Manet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"Montagutelli","email":"xavier.montagutelli@pasteur.fr","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"Montagutelli","email":"xavier.montagutelli@pasteur.fr","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.tcb.2013.12.002","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Trafficking

COVID-19","abstract":"The immune system is complex and involves many genes, including those that encode cytokines known as interferons (IFNs).\n Individuals that lack specific IFNs can be more susceptible to infectious diseases.\n Furthermore, the autoantibody system dampens IFN response to prevent damage from pathogen-induced inflammation.\n Two studies now examine the likelihood that genetics affects the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through components of this system (see the Perspective by Beck and Aksentijevich).\n Q.\n Zhang et al.\n used a candidate gene approach and identified patients with severe COVID-19 who have mutations in genes involved in the regulation of type I and III IFN immunity.\n They found enrichment of these genes in patients and conclude that genetics may determine the clinical course of the infection.\n Bastard et al.\n identified individuals with high titers of neutralizing autoantibodies against type I IFN-?2 and IFN-? in about 10% of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.\n These autoantibodies were not found either in infected people who were asymptomatic or had milder phenotype or in healthy individuals.\n Together, these studies identify a means by which individuals at highest risk of life-threatening COVID-19 can be identified.\n","id":"PMC7857407","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qian","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Bastard","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Bastard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jérémie","surname":"Le

role of host genetics in susceptibility to severe viral infections in humans and insights into host genetics of severe COVID-19: A systematic review","abstract":"Background\nSusceptibility to severe viral infections was reported to be associated with genetic variants in immune response genes using case reports and GWAS studies.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 is an emergent viral disease that caused millions of COVID-19 cases all over the world.\n\n Around 15 % of cases are severe and some of them are accompanied by dysregulated immune system and cytokine storm.\n\n There is increasing evidence that severe manifestations of COVID-19 might be attributed to human genetic variants in genes related to immune deficiency and or inflammasome activation (cytokine storm).\n\n\nObjective\nIdentify the candidate genes that are likely to aid in explaining severe COVID-19 and provide insights to understand the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn this article, we systematically reviewed genes related to viral susceptibility that were reported in human genetic studies (Case-reports and GWAS) to understand the role of host viral interactions and to provide insights into the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.\nResults\nWe found 40 genes associated with viral susceptibility and 21 of them were associated with severe SARS-CoV disease and severe COVID-19. Some of those genes were implicated in TLR pathways, others in C-lectin pathways, and others were related to inflammasome activation (cytokine storm).\n\n\nConclusion\nThis compilation represents a list of candidate genes that are likely to aid in explaining severe COVID-19 which are worthy of inclusion in gene panels and during meta-analysis of different variants in host genetics studies of COVID-19. In addition, we provide several hypotheses for severe COVID-19 and possible therapeutic targets.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7480444","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Abdelazeem","surname":"Elhabyan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saja","surname":"Elyaacoub","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ehab","surname":"Sanad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abdelwahab","surname":"Abukhadra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Asmaa","surname":"Elhabyan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Valentin","surname":"Dinu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s40246-020-00280-6","date":"2020-08-31","title":"Genetic variants of the human host influencing the coronavirus-associated phenotypes (SARS, MERS and COVID-19): rapid systematic review and field synopsis","abstract":"id='Par1'>The COVID-19 pandemic has strengthened the interest in the biological mechanisms underlying the complex interplay between infectious agents and the human host.\n The spectrum of phenotypes associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, ranging from the absence of symptoms to severe systemic complications, raised the question as to what extent the variable response to coronaviruses (CoVs) is influenced by the variability of the hosts’ genetic background.\n","id":"PMC7484929","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emilio","surname":"Di Maria","email":"emilio.dimaria@unige.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrea","surname":"Latini","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Andrea","surname":"Latini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paola","surname":"Borgiani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Novelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41586-020-03065-y","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Genetic mechanisms of critical illness in Covid-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1093/infdis/jiaa224","date":"2020-04-28","title":"Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein 3 Genetic Variant rs12252-C Associated With Disease Severity in Coronavirus Disease 2019","abstract":"A major unanswered question in the current global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is why severe disease develops in a small minority of infected individuals.\n In the current article, we report that homozygosity for the C allele of rs12252 in the interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) gene is associated with more severe disease in an age-dependent manner.\n This supports a role for IFITM3 in disease pathogenesis and the opportunity for early targeted intervention in at-risk individuals.\n","id":"PMC7197559","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yonghong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lianchun","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yanchao","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yingmei","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhongjie","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haiping","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julian C","surname":"Knight","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Dong","email":"tao.dong@imm.ox.ac.uk","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ronghua","surname":"Jin","email":"jin_eagle@yahoo.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155354","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 gene (IFITM3) rs12252 C variant is associated with COVID-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0242534","date":"2020-11-05","title":"Clinical and molecular characterization of COVID-19 hospitalized patients","abstract":"Clinical and molecular characterization by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is reported in 35 COVID-19 patients attending the University Hospital in Siena, Italy, from April 7 to May 7, 2020.

cohorts of B-cell leukemia and lymphoma patients, we identified IFITM3 as a strong predictor of poor outcome.\n In normal resting B-cells, Ifitm3 was minimally expressed and mainly localized in endosomes.\n However, B-cell receptor (BCR) engagement induced expression of Ifitm3 and phosphorylation at Y20, resulting in accumulation at the cell surface.\n In B-cell leukemia, oncogenic kinases phosphorylate IFITM3-Y20, causing constitutive plasma membrane localization.\n Ifitm3?/? naïve B-cells developed at normal numbers; however, germinal center formation and production of antigen-specific antibodies were compromised.\n Oncogenes that induce development of leukemia and lymphoma failed to transform Ifitm3?/?

Meta-analysis 2.0 (CMA 2.0) software was applied for meta-analysis.\n\n\nResults\nOur results demonstrated that asthma patients presented with higher frequencies of GA genotype in rs2275913 and TT genotype in rs8193036 of IL-17 than healthy controls (both P&lt;0.001).\n\n The genotype frequencies of IL-17 rs763780 between the asthma patients and healthy controls exhibited no significant differences (P&gt;0.05).\n\n The comparisons on the rs2275913 and rs8193036 frequencies between the asthma patients and healthy controls were statistically significant in both allele and addictive models (all P&lt;0.05).\n\n The frequency of IL-17 rs763780 between the asthma patients and healthy controls were statistically different in allele models (P&lt;0.05), but not in addictive models (P&gt;0.05).\n\n The overall results of our case-control study were further confirmed by meta-analysis.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results revealed that, in an Asian population, IL-17 rs763780, rs2275913, and rs8193036 SNPs may be associated with asthma susceptibility, and GA genotype in rs2275913 and TT genotype in rs8193036 of IL-17 may contribute to increased risk of asthma in Asians.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4793684","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ji-Chang","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ya-Jun","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guan-Bin","surname":"Qi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong-Bing","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi-Jie","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shao","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.11.05.20226761","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Genetic

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly heterogenous.\n\n Studies have reported that males and some ethnic groups are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, which implies that individual risk of death might be influenced by host genetic factors.\n\n\nMethods\nid='P5'>In this project, we consider the mortality as the trait of interest and perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of data for 1,778 infected cases (445 deaths, 25.03%) distributed by the UK Biobank.\n\n Traditional GWAS failed to identify any genome-wide significant genetic variants from

analysis of mouse and human macrophages indicated that they gain M1 and M2-related functions after encountering specific ligands in the tissue environment.\n In this perspective, I discuss the function of recepteur d’origine nantais (RON) receptor tyrosine kinase in regulating the M2-like state of macrophage activation Besides decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to toll-like receptor-4 activation, macrophage-stimulating protein strongly suppresses nitric oxide synthase and at the same time upregulates arginase, which is the rate limiting enzyme in the ornithine

Bisphenol A (BPA) is among the most common EDCs and exerts its effects via receptors which are widely distributed in human tissues, including nuclear oestrogen receptors (ER? and ER?), membrane-bound oestrogen receptor (G protein-coupled receptor 30; GPR30), and human nuclear receptor oestrogen-related receptor gamma.\n As such, this paper focuses on the potential role of BPA in promoting comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19, as well as on potential BPA-induced effects on key SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2).\n Interestingly, GPR30 appears to exhibit greater co-localisation with TMPRSS2 in key tissues like lung and prostate, suggesting that BPA exposure may impact on the local expression of these SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators.\n Overall, the potential role of BPA on the risk and severity of COVID-19 merits further investigation.\n","id":"PMC7602132","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Aeman","surname":"Zahra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cristina","surname":"Sisu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elisabete","surname":"Silva","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Elisabete","surname":"Silva","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sophie-Christine","surname":"De Aguiar Greca","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Harpal S.","surname":"Randeva","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kamaljit","surname":"Chatha","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ioannis","surname":"Kyrou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emmanouil","surname":"Karteris","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Emmanouil","surname":"Karteris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2021.01.25.428137","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Antibody Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.7","abstract":"id='P2'>The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the globe, and its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, continues to rage.\n Prospects of ending this pandemic rest on the development of effective interventions.\n Single and combination monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics have received emergency use authorization1–3, with more in the pipeline4–7.\n Furthermore, multiple vaccine constructs have shown promise8, including two with ~95% protective efficacy against COVID-199,10.\n However, these interventions were directed toward the initial SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2019.

to inform clinical management decisions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe developed and validated a multivariable logistic regression model for in-hospital clinical deterioration (defined as any requirement of ventilatory support or critical care, or death) among consecutively hospitalised adults with highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who were prospectively recruited to the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (ISARIC4C) study across 260 hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales.\n\n Candidate predictors that were specified a priori were considered for inclusion in the model on the basis of previous prognostic scores and emerging literature describing routinely measured biomarkers associated with COVID-19 prognosis.\n\n We used internal–external cross-validation to evaluate discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility across eight National Health Service (NHS) regions in the development cohort.\n\n We further validated the final model in held-out data from an additional NHS region (London).\n\n\nFindings\n74?944 participants (recruited between Feb 6 and Aug 26, 2020) were included, of whom 31?924 (43·2%) of 73?948 with available outcomes met the composite clinical deterioration outcome.\n\n In internal–external cross-validation in the development cohort of 66?705 participants, the selected model (comprising 11 predictors routinely measured at the point of hospital admission) showed consistent discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility across all eight NHS regions.\n\n In held-out data from London (n=8239), the model showed a similarly consistent performance (C-statistic 0·77 [95% CI 0·76 to 0·78]; calibration-in-the-large 0·00 [–0·05 to 0·05]); calibration slope 0·96 [0·91 to 1·01]), and greater net benefit than any other reproducible prognostic model.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 4C Deterioration model has strong potential for clinical utility and generalisability to predict clinical deterioration and inform decision making among adults hospitalised with COVID-19.\nFunding\nNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR), UK Medical Research

While the elderly are most severely affected, implicating an age bias, a striking factor in the demographics of this deadly disease is the gender bias, with higher numbers of cases, greater disease severity, and higher death rates among men than women across the lifespan.\n While pre-existing comorbidities and social, behavioral, and lifestyle factors contribute to this bias, biological factors underlying the host immune response may be crucial contributors.\n Women mount stronger immune responses to infections and vaccinations and outlive men.\n Sex-based biological factors underlying the immune response are therefore important determinants of susceptibility to infections, disease outcomes, and mortality.\n Despite this, gender is a profoundly understudied and often overlooked variable in research related to the immune response and infectious diseases, and it is largely ignored in drug and vaccine clinical trials.\n Understanding these factors will not only help better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19, but it will also guide the design of effective therapies and vaccine strategies for gender-based personalized medicine.\n This review focuses on sex-based differences in genes, sex hormones, and the microbiome underlying the host immune response and their relevance to infections with a focus on coronaviruses.\n","id":"PMC7485092","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nirupa","surname":"Gadi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Samantha C.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Allison P.","surname":"Spihlman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vaishali R.","surname":"Moulton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s10020-020-00216-9","date":"2020-09-07","title":"The role of host defences in Covid 19 and treatments thereof","abstract":"id='Par1'>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a natural defence against the infections from enveloped RNA viruses and is likely involved also in Covid 19. It was already shown to inhibit growth and pathogenic mechanisms of a variety of enveloped RNA viruses and it was now found that circulating H2S is higher in Covid 19 survivors compared to fatal cases.\n H2S release is triggered by carbon monoxide (CO) from the catabolism of heme by inducible heme oxygenase (HO-1) and heme proteins possess catalytic activity necessary for the H2S signalling by protein persulfidation.\n Subjects with a long promoter for the HMOX1 gene, coding for HO-1, are predicted for lower efficiency of this mechanism.\n SARS-cov-2 exerts ability to attack the heme of hemoglobin and other heme-proteins thus hampering both release and signalling of H2S.\n Lack of H2S-induced persulfidation of the KATP channels of leucocytes causes adhesion and release of the inflammatory cytokines, lung infiltration and systemic endothelial damage with hyper-coagulability.\n These events largely explain the sex and age distribution, clinical manifestations and co-morbidities of Covid-19. The understanding of this mechanism may be of guidance in re-evaluating the ongoing therapeutic strategies, with special attention to the interaction with mechanical ventilation, paracetamol and chloroquine use, and in the individuation of genetic traits causing increased susceptibility to the disruption of these physiologic processes and to a critical Covid 19.

action, pharmacokinetics, dosing, safety, and their future perspective.\n Relevant articles with experimental studies conducted in-silico, in-vitro, in-vivo, clinical trials in humans, case reports, and news archives were selected for the review.\n Number of drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, arbidol, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab and interferons have shown inhibitory effects against the SARS-CoV2 in-vitro as well as in clinical conditions.\n These drugs either act through virus-related targets such as RNA genome, polypeptide packing and uptake pathways or target host-related pathways involving angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors and inflammatory pathways.\n Using the basic knowledge of viral pathogenesis and pharmacodynamics of drugs as well as using computational tools, many drugs are currently in pipeline to be repurposed.\n In the current scenario, repositioning of the drugs could be considered the new

MERS?CoV.\n Human ACE2 is now established as a receptor for the SARS?CoV?2 spike protein.\n Where variations in the viral spike protein, in turn, lead to the cross?species transmission of the virus, genetic variations in the host receptor ACE2 may also contribute to the susceptibility and/or resistance against the viral infection.\n This study aims to explore the binding of the proteins encoded by different human ACE2 allelic variants with SARS?CoV?2 spike protein.\n Briefly, coding variants of ACE2 corresponding to the reported binding sites for its attachment with coronavirus spike protein were selected and molecular models of these variants were constructed by homology modeling.\n The models were then superimposed over the native ACE2 and ACE2?spike protein complex, to observe structural changes in the ACE2 variants and their intermolecular interactions with SARS?CoV?2 spike protein, respectively.\n Despite strong overall structural similarities, the spatial orientation of the key interacting residues varies in the ACE2 variants compared with the wild?type molecule.\n Most ACE2 variants showed a similar binding affinity for SARS?CoV?2 spike protein as observed in the complex structure of wild?type ACE2 and SARS?CoV?2 spike protein.\n However, ACE2 alleles, rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G) showed noticeable variations in their intermolecular interactions with the viral spike protein.\n In summary, our data provide a structural basis of potential resistance against SARS?CoV?2 infection driven by ACE2 allelic

gene and susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) was conducted in a hospital-based case-control study including 75 SARS patients, 41 health care workers and 92 healthy controls.\n\n Relationships of TNF-? gene polymorphisms with interstitial lung fibrosis and femoral head osteonecrosis were carried out in two case-case studies in discharged SARS patients.\n\n PCR sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) method was used to determine the polymorphisms of TNF-?

Although ARBs have been shown to up-regulate ACE2 tissue expression in experimental animals, evidence was not always consistent in human studies.\n Moreover, to date there is no evidence that ACEi or ARB administration facilitates SARS-COV2 cell entry by increasing ACE2 tissue expression in either animal or human studies.\n Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection.\n In summary, based on the currently available evidence and as advocated by many medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be discontinued because of concerns with COVID-19 infection, except when the hemodynamic situation is precarious and case-by-case adjustment is required.\n","id":"PMC7172808","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joachim","surname":"Alexandre","email":"alexandre-j@chu-caen.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Luc","surname":"Cracowski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincent","surname":"Richard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Béatrice","surname":"Bouhanick","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/acn3.51166","date":"2020-07-30","title":"Neurological manifestations of coronavirus infections – a systematic review","abstract":"To optimize diagnostic workup of the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2) pandemic, we systematically reviewed neurological and neuroradiological manifestations of SARS?CoV?2 and all other known human coronavirus species (HCoV).\n Which lessons can we learn?

viruses in primary human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells","abstract":"Background\nFatal human respiratory disease associated with influenza A subtype H5N1 has been documented in Hong Kong, and more recently in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia.\n\n We previously demonstrated that patients with H5N1 disease had unusually high serum levels of IP-10 (interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10).\n\n Furthermore, when compared with human influenza virus subtype H1N1, the H5N1 viruses in 1997 (A/Hong Kong/483/97) (H5N1/97) were more potent inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.\n\ng.\n\n tumor necrosis factor-a) and chemokines (e.\n\ng.\n\n IP-10) from primary human macrophages in vitro, which suggests that cytokines dysregulation may play a role in pathogenesis of H5N1 disease.\n\n Since respiratory epithelial cells are the primary target cell for replication of influenza viruses, it is pertinent to investigate the cytokine induction profile of H5N1 viruses in these cells.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA to compare the profile of cytokine and chemokine gene expression induced by H5N1 viruses A/HK/483/97 (H5N1/97), A/Vietnam/1194/04 and A/Vietnam/3046/04 (both H5N1/04) with that of human H1N1 virus in human primary alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro.\n\n\nResults\nWe demonstrated that in comparison to human H1N1 viruses, H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 viruses were more potent inducers of IP-10, interferon beta, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in primary human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro.\n\n Recent H5N1 viruses from Vietnam (H5N1/04) appeared to be even more potent at inducing IP-10 than H5N1/97 virus.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 subtype influenza A viruses are more potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in primary human respiratory epithelial cells than subtype H1N1 virus.\n\n We suggest that this hyper-induction of cytokines may be relevant to the pathogenesis of human H5N1

without dermatological lesions were thoroughly described and compared.\n The results indicated that HTLV-1-infected patients with dermatological lesions have distinct frequency and activation status when compared to asymptomatic carriers.\n Alterations in the CD4+HLA-DR+, CD8+ T cell, macrophage-like and NKT subsets as well as in the serum chemokines CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were observed in the HTLV-1-infected group with skin lesions.\n Additionally, HTLV-1 carriers with dermatological skin lesions showed more frequently high proviral load as compared to asymptomatic carriers.\n The elevated proviral load in HTLV-1 patients with infectious skin lesions correlated significantly with TNF-?/IL-10 ratio, while the same significant correlation was found for the IL-12/IL-10 ratio and the high proviral load in HTLV-1-infected patients with autoimmune skin lesions.\n All in all, these results suggest a distinct and unique immunological profile in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1-infected patients with skin disorders, and the different nature of skin lesion observed in these patients may be an outcome of a distinct unbalance of the systemic inflammatory response upon

in Chinese people in December 2019 and has currently spread worldwide causing the COVID-19 pandemic with more than 150,000 deaths.\n In order for a SARS-CoV like virus circulating in wild life for a very long time to infect the index case-patient, a number of conditions must be met, foremost among which is the encounter with humans and the presence in homo sapiens of a cellular receptor allowing the virus to bind.\n Recently it was shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, binds to the human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n This molecule is a peptidase expressed at the surface of lung epithelial cells and other tissues, that regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n Humans are not equal with respect to the expression levels of the cellular ACE2. Moreover, ACE2 polymorphisms were recently described in human populations.\n Here we review the most recent evidence that ACE2 expression and/or polymorphism could influence both the susceptibility of people to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the outcome of the COVID-19 disease.\n Further exploration of the relationship between the virus, the peptidase function of ACE2 and the levels of angiotensin II in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients should help to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease and the multi-organ failures observed in severe COVID-19 cases, particularly heart

types both during physiological immune defense and in pathological circumstances, such as autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, as well as infectious diseases, obesity, diabetes, and various types of cancer.\n However, new data suggest that the scope of CCL2's functions may extend beyond its original characterization as a chemoattractant.\n Emerging evidence shows that it can impact leukocyte behavior, influencing adhesion, polarization, effector molecule secretion, autophagy, killing, and survival.\n The direction of these CCL2-induced responses is context dependent and, in some cases, synergistic with other inflammatory stimuli.\n The involvement of CCL2 signaling in multiple diseases renders it an interesting therapeutic target, although current targeting strategies have not met early expectations in the clinic.\n A better understanding of how CCL2 affects immune cells will be pivotal to the improvement of existing therapeutic approaches and the development of new drugs.\n Here, we provide an overview of the pleiotropic effects of CCL2 signaling on cells of the myeloid

T-cells, committed Th17 cells and promotes neutrophil recruitment to the lung.\n Inhibiting this isoform not only suppresses IL-17A secretion from Th17 cells, but it also inhibits cytokine production from multiple T-helper cell types.\n Since increased IL-17A levels are observed to be localized in the lung compartments (BAL and lymphocytes) in comparison to circulating levels, an inhalable PI3K?

as Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) play an important role.\n\n Previous studies show that variations in the RANTES gene affect RANTES protein production, hence altering host immunity.\n\n In this study, the relationship between presence of mutations in RANTES and incidence of malaria in a cohort of children living in a malaria-endemic area of Uganda was determined.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a longitudinal study comprising of 423 children aged between 6 months and 9 years, who were actively followed up for 1 year.\n\n Malaria episodes occurring in the cohort children were detected and the affected children treated with national policy drug regimen.\n\n Mutations in the RANTES gene were determined by PCR–RFLP method and their frequencies were calculated.\n\n A multivariate negative binomial regression model was used to estimate the impact of RANTES mutations on malaria incidence.\n\n In all statistical tests, a P-value of &lt;0.05 was considered as significant.\n\n\nResults\nThe frequencies of the ?403A and In1.1C allele were 53.7 and 19.2 %, respectively.\n\n No mutations were found at the ?28 locus.\n\n After adjustment of incidence rates for age, blood group, insecticide-treated bed net (ITN) use, malaria history and the sickle cell trait, 1n1.1T/C heterozygotes and homozygotes showed a non-significant trend towards higher incidence rates compared to wild-type individuals (IRR = 1.10; P = 0.55 and IRR = 1.25; P = 0.60, respectively).\n\n Similarly, there was no significant difference in malaria incidence rates between RANTES ?403G/A heterozygotes or homozygotes and those without mutations (IRR = 1.09; P = 0.66 and IRR = 1.16; P = 0.50, respectively).\n\n No relation was seen between RANTES polymorphisms, baseline parasite densities and the time to first re-infection after administration of anti-malaria drugs.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study showed that the ?403A mutation occurs in nearly half of the study population and the In1.1C allele occurs in one in every four children.\n\n Despite the high frequency of these mutations, there was no clear association with malaria incidence.\n\n Other studies evaluating more markers, that could potentially modulate RANTES gene transcription alongside other genetic modifiers of malaria susceptibility, may provide further explanations to these less dramatic findings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4560921","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Catherine

data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January 10 to February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed.\n\n The data of laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection.\n\n The median age was 58 years and 235 were male.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia.\n\n Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.\n\n Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines.\n\n The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases.\n\n Both helper T cells and suppressor

Since E-CR1 expression is influenced by the genetic polymorphisms in the CR1 gene, a major genetic polymorphism located within intron 27 of the CR1 gene was simultaneously analysed by polymerase chain

in prognosis of patients with lung interstitial fibrosis and femoral head osteonecrosis.\n\n\nMethods\nThe association between genetic polymorphisms of TNF-? gene and susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) was conducted in a hospital-based case-control study including 75 SARS patients, 41 health care workers and 92 healthy controls.\n\n Relationships of TNF-? gene polymorphisms with interstitial lung fibrosis and femoral head osteonecrosis were carried out in two case-case studies in discharged SARS patients.\n\n PCR sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) method was used to determine the polymorphisms of TNF-? gene in locus of the promoter region and univariate logistic analysis was conducted in analyzing the collected data.\n\n\nResults\nCompared to TT genotype, the CT genotype at the -204 locus was found associated with a protective effect on SARS with OR(95%CI) of 0.95(0.90–0.99).\n\n Also, TT genotype, CT and CC were found associated with a risk effect on femoral head necrosis with ORs(95%CI) of 5.33(1.39–20.45) and 5.67(2.74–11.71), respectively and the glucocorticoid adjusted OR of CT was 5.25(95%CI 1.18–23.46) and the combined (CT and CC) genotype

lectin DC-SIGN (CD209) is known to be the major dengue receptor on human dendritic cells, and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of CD209 (?336 A/G; rs4804803) is susceptible to many infectious diseases.\n\n We reason that variations in the DC-SIGN gene might have a broad influence on viral replication and host immune responses.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nWe studied whether the rs4804803 SNP was associated with a susceptibility to dengue fever (DF) and/or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) through genotyping analysis in a Taiwanese cohort.\n\n We generated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from individuals with AA or AG genotype of rs4804803 to study the viral replication and immune responses for functional validation.\n\n A total of 574 DNA samples were genotyped, including 176 DF, 135 DHF, 143 other non-dengue febrile illnesses (OFI) and 120 population controls.\n\n A strong association between GG/AG genotypes of rs4804803 and risk of DHF was found when compared among DF, OFI and controls (p?=?0.004, 3×10?5 and 0.001, respectively).\n\n The AA genotype was associated with protection against dengue infection compared with OFI and controls (p?=?0.002 and 0.020, respectively).\n\n Moreover, MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype with a higher cell surface DC-SIGN expression had a significantly higher TNF?, IL-12p40, and IP-10 production than those with AA genotype in response to dengue infection.\n\n However, the viral replication in MDDCs with AG genotype was significantly lower than those with AA genotype.\n\n With both genotypes, MDDCs revealed an increase in viral replication following the addition of anti-IP-10 neutralizing antibody.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThe rs4804803 SNP in the CD209 promoter contributed to susceptibility to dengue infection and complication of DHF.\n\n This SNP with AG genotype affects the cell surface DC-SIGN expression related to immune augmentation and less viral

comprised 95 cases of recovered SARS patients and 403 unrelated healthy controls.\n HLA ?A, ?B and ?DRB1 alleles were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction with sequence?specific primers.\n The

B60, DRB1*12 in the SARS group were slightly higher, and A33, ?B58 and ?B61 were lower than in the controls, no statistical significance was found when the Pc value was considered.\n Similarly, no

of SARS-CoV-2 Pseudotyped Viral Particles","abstract":"Human SP-D is a potent innate immune molecule whose presence at pulmonary mucosal surfaces allows its role in immune surveillance against pathogens.\n Higher levels of serum SP-D have been reported in the patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n Studies have suggested the ability of human SP-D to recognise spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV; its interaction with HCoV-229E strain leads to viral inhibition in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells.\n Previous studies have reported that a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) composed of 8 Gly-X-Y repeats, neck and CRD region, can act against a range of viral pathogens including influenza A Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo.\n In this context, this study was aimed at examining the likely protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n rfhSP-D showed a dose-responsive binding to S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor binding domain.\n Importantly, rfhSP-D inhibited interaction of S1 protein with the HEK293T cells overexpressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2).\n The protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection as an entry inhibitor was further validated by the use of pseudotyped lentiviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein; ~0.5 RLU fold reduction in viral entry was seen following treatment with rfhSP-D (10 µg/ml).\n These results highlight the therapeutic potential of rfhSP-D in SARS-CoV-2 infection and merit pre-clinical

associations, and flagging genes that have previously been incorrectly implicated in disease.\n GADO can be run on www.\ngenenetwork.\nnl by supplying HPO-terms and a list of genes that contain candidate variants.\n Finally, applying GADO to a cohort of 61 patients for whom exome-sequencing analysis had not resulted in a genetic diagnosis, yields likely causative genes for ten cases.\n","id":"PMC6599066","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Deelen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sipko","surname":"van

Genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility (P&lt;5 × 10?8) in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used as instrumental variables (IVs).\n\n Effect estimates of those IVs on COVID-19 severity were gathered from the GWAS meta-analysis by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (4,336 cases &amp; 623,902 controls).\n\n\nFindings\nWe detected a positive genetic correlation of IPF with COVID-19 severity (rg=0·31 [95% CI 0·04–0·57], P = 0·023).\n\n The MR estimates for severe COVID-19 did not reveal any genetic association (OR 1·05, [95% CI 0·92–1·20], P = 0·43).\n\n However, outlier analysis revealed that the IPF risk allele rs35705950 at MUC5B had a different effect compared with the other variants.\n\n When rs35705950 was excluded, MR results provided evidence that genetically increased risk of IPF has a causal effect on COVID-19 severity (OR 1·21, [95% CI 1·06–1·38], P = 4·24 × 10?3).\n\n Furthermore, the IPF risk-allele at MUC5B showed an apparent protective effect against COVID-19 hospitalization only in older adults (OR 0·86, [95% CI 0·73–1·00], P = 2·99 × 10?2) .\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe strongest genetic determinant of IPF, rs35705950 at MUC5B, seems to confer protection against COVID-19, whereas the combined effect of all other IPF risk loci seem to confer risk of COVID-19 severity.\n\n The observed effect of rs35705950 could either be due to protective effects of mucin over-production on the airways or a consequence of selection bias due to (1) a patient group that is heavily enriched for the rs35705950 T undertaking strict self-isolation and/or (2) due to survival bias of the rs35705950 non-IPF risk allele carriers.\n\n Due to the diverse impact of IPF causal variants on SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a possible selection bias as an explanation, further investigation is needed to address this apparent paradox between variance at MUC5B and other IPF genetic risk factors.\n\n\nFunding\nNovo Nordisk Foundation and Oak Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7946355","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"João","surname":"Fadista","email":"joaofadista@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luke M.","surname":"Kraven","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juha","surname":"Karjalainen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shea J.","surname":"Andrews","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frank","surname":"Geller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J Kenneth","surname":"Baillie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Louise V.","surname":"Wain","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"R.Gisli","surname":"Jenkins","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bjarke","surname":"Feenstra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2013.5827","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association between the MUC5B promoter polymorphism and survival in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00726-014-1889-6","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Human intestine luminal ACE2 and amino acid transporter expression increased by ACE-inhibitors","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Horowitz, J.

The GenOMICC (Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care) study enables the comparison of genomes from individuals who are critically ill with those of population controls to find underlying disease mechanisms.\n Here we use whole-genome sequencing in 7,491 critically ill individuals compared with 48,400 controls to discover and replicate 23 independent variants that significantly predispose to critical COVID-19. We identify 16 new independent associations, including variants within genes that are involved in interferon signalling (IL10RB and PLSCR1), leucocyte differentiation (BCL11A) and blood-type antigen secretor status (FUT2).\n Using transcriptome-wide association and colocalization to infer the effect of gene expression on disease severity, we find evidence that implicates multiple genes—including reduced expression of a membrane flippase (ATP11A), and increased expression of a mucin (MUC1)—in critical disease.\n Mendelian randomization provides evidence in support of causal roles for myeloid cell adhesion molecules (SELE, ICAM5 and CD209) and the coagulation factor F8, all of which are potentially druggable targets.\n Our results are broadly consistent with a multi-component model of COVID-19 pathophysiology, in which at least two distinct mechanisms can predispose to life-threatening disease: failure to control viral replication; or an enhanced tendency towards pulmonary inflammation and intravascular coagulation.\n We show that comparison between cases of critical illness and population controls is highly efficient for the detection of therapeutically relevant

implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences,

mutations.\n Here, we investigated 80 variants and 26 glycosylation site modifications for the infectivity and reactivity to a panel of neutralizing antibodies and sera from convalescent patients.\n D614G, along with several variants containing both D614G and another amino acid change, were significantly more infectious.\n Most variants with amino acid change at receptor binding domain were less infectious, but variants including A475V, L452R, V483A, and F490L became resistant to some neutralizing antibodies.\n Moreover, the majority of glycosylation deletions were less infectious, whereas deletion of both N331 and N343 glycosylation drastically reduced infectivity, revealing the importance of glycosylation for viral infectivity.\n Interestingly, N234Q was markedly resistant to neutralizing antibodies, whereas N165Q became more sensitive.\n These findings could be of value in the development of vaccine and therapeutic

Leukocyte Antigen Complex and Other Immunogenetic and Clinical Factors Influence Susceptibility or Protection to SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Severity of the Disease Course. The Sardinian Experience","abstract":"Aim\nSARS-CoV-2 infection is a world-wide public health problem.\n\n Several aspects of its pathogenesis and the related clinical consequences still need elucidation.\n\n In Italy, Sardinia has had very low numbers of infections.\n\n Taking advantage of the low genetic polymorphism in the Sardinian population, we analyzed clinical, genetic and immunogenetic factors, with particular attention to HLA class I and II molecules, to evaluate their influence on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcome.\n\n\nMethod and Materials\nWe recruited 619 healthy Sardinian controls and 182 SARS-CoV-2 patients.\n\n Thirty-nine patients required hospital care and 143 were without symptoms, pauci-symptomatic or with mild disease.\n\n For all participants, we collected demographic and clinical data and analyzed the HLA allele and haplotype frequencies.\n\n\nResults\nMale sex and older age were more frequent in hospitalized patients, none of whom had been vaccinated during the previous seasonal flu vaccination campaignes.\n\n Compared to the group of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients, hospitalized patients also had a higher frequency of autoimmune diseases and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PDH) deficiency.\n\n None of these patients carried the beta-thalassemia trait, a relatively common finding in the Sardinian population.\n\n The extended haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01, DRB1*03:01 [OR 0.1 (95% CI 0–0.6), Pc = 0.015] was absent in all 182 patients, while the HLA-C*04:01 allele and the three-loci haplotype HLA-A*30:02, B*14:02, C*08:02 [OR 3.8 (95% CI 1.8–8.1), Pc = 0.025] were more frequently represented in patients than controls.\n\n In a comparison between in-patients and home care patients, the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele was exclusively present in the hospitalized patients [OR &gt; 2.5 (95% CI 2.7–220.6), Pc = 0.024].\n\n\nConclusion\nThe data emerging from our study suggest that the extended haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01, DRB1*03:01 has a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Sardinian population.\n\n Genetic factors that resulted to have a negative influence on the disease course were presence of the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele and G6PDH deficiency, but not the beta-thalassemic trait.\n\n Absence of influenza vaccination could be a predisposing factor for more severe disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7746644","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Roberto","surname":"Littera","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marcello","surname":"Campagna","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Silvia","surname":"Deidda","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Goffredo","surname":"Angioni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Selene","surname":"Cipri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maurizio","surname":"Melis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Davide","surname":"Firinu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simonetta","surname":"Santus","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alberto","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rita","surname":"Porcella","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sara","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefania","surname":"Rassu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rosetta","surname":"Scioscia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Federico","surname":"Meloni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniele","surname":"Schirru","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"William","surname":"Cordeddu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marta

coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).\n\n Genomewide association analysis may allow for the identification of potential genetic factors involved in the development of Covid-19.\nMethods\nWe conducted a genomewide association study involving 1980 patients with Covid-19 and severe disease (defined as respiratory failure) at seven hospitals in the Italian and Spanish epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe.\n\n After quality control and the exclusion of population outliers, 835 patients and 1255 control participants from Italy and 775 patients and 950 control participants from Spain were included in the final analysis.\n\n In total, we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and conducted a meta-analysis of the two case–control panels.\n\n\nResults\nWe detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at locus 3p21.31 and with rs657152 at locus 9q34.2, which were significant at the genomewide level (P&lt;5×10?8) in the meta-analysis of the two

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly heterogenous.\n\n Studies have reported that males and some ethnic groups are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, which implies that individual risk of death might be influenced by host genetic factors.\n\n\nMethods\nid='P5'>In this project, we consider the mortality as the trait of interest and perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of data for 1,778 infected cases (445 deaths, 25.03%) distributed by the UK Biobank.\n\n Traditional GWAS failed to identify any genome-wide significant genetic variants from this dataset.\n\n To enhance the power of GWAS and account for possible multi-loci interactions, we adopt the concept of super-variant for the detection of genetic factors.\n\n A discovery-validation procedure is used for verifying the potential associations.\n\n\nResults\nid='P6'>We find 8 super-variants that are consistently identified across multiple replications as susceptibility loci for COVID-19 mortality.\n\n The identified risk factors on Chromosomes 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 16, and 17 contain genetic variants and genes related to cilia dysfunctions (DNAH7 and CLUAP1), cardiovascular diseases (DES and SPEG), thromboembolic disease (STXBP5), mitochondrial dysfunctions (TOMM7), and innate immune system (WSB1).\n\n It is noteworthy that DNAH7 has been reported recently as the most downregulated gene after infecting human bronchial epithelial cells with SARS-CoV2.\nConclusions\nid='P7'>Eight genetic variants are identified to significantly increase risk of COVID-19 mortality among the patients with white British ancestry.\n\n These findings may provide timely evidence and clues for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of COVID-19 and genetic basis of

SARS-CoV-2-positive patients","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that are common in humans and many animal species.\n\n Animal coronaviruses rarely infect humans with the exceptions of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV), and now SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n Several studies suggested that genetic variants in the ACE2 gene may influence the host susceptibility or resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection according to the functional role of ACE2 in human pathophysiology.\n\n However, many of these studies have been conducted in silico based on epidemiological and population data.\n\n We therefore investigated the occurrence of ACE2 variants in a cohort of 131 Italian unrelated individuals clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 and in an Italian control population, to evaluate a possible allelic association with COVID-19, by direct DNA analysis.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>As a pilot study, we analyzed, by whole-exome sequencing, genetic variants of ACE2 gene in 131 DNA samples of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Tor Vergata University Hospital and at Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital, Rome.\n\n We used a large control group consisting of 1000 individuals (500 males and 500 females).\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>We identified three different germline variants: one intronic c.\n\n439+4G&gt;A and two missense c.\n\n1888G&gt;C p.\n\n(Asp630His) and c.\n\n2158A&gt;G p.\n\n(Asn720Asp) in a total of 131 patients with a similar frequency in male and female.\n\n Thus far, only the c.\n\n1888G&gt;C p.\n\n(Asp630His) variant shows a statistically different frequency compared to the ethnically matched populations.\n\n Therefore, further studies are needed in larger cohorts, since it was found only in one heterozygous COVID-19 patient.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Our results suggest that there is no strong evidence, in our cohort, of consistent association of ACE2 variants with COVID-19 severity.\n\n We might speculate that rare susceptibility/resistant alleles could be located in the non-coding regions of the ACE2 gene, known to play a role in regulation of the gene activity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7483483","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Novelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michela","surname":"Biancolella","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paola","surname":"Borgiani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dario","surname":"Cocciadiferro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vito

investigated SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects with defined outcomes, evaluating the relationship between viral load and single nucleotide polymorphisms of genes codifying for IFN?s (interferon).\n The study enrolled 381 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n For each patient, a standardized form was filled including sociodemographic variables and clinical outcomes.\n The host’s gene polymorphisms (IFNL3 rs1297860 C/T and INFL4 rs368234815 TT/?G) and RtReal-Time PCR cycle threshold (PCR Ct) value on SARS-CoV-2 were assessed on nasal, pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs.\n Higher viral loads were found in patients aged &gt; 74 years and homozygous mutant polymorphisms DG in IFNL4 (adj-OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.01–1.34 and adj-OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.09–1.40, respectively).\n After adjusting for age and sex, a statistically significantly lower risk of hospitalization was observed in subjects with higher RtReal-Time PCR cycle threshold values (adj-OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.91, 0.99; p = 0.028).\n Our data support the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 load and disease severity, and suggest that IFN? polymorphisms could affect the ability of the host to modulate viral infection

gene variants may underlie interindividual variability and susceptibility to COVID-19 in the Italian population","abstract":"id='Par1'>In December 2019, an initial cluster of interstitial bilateral pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China.\n A human-to-human transmission was assumed and a previously unrecognized entity, termed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was described.\n The infection has rapidly spread out all over the world and Italy has been the first European country experiencing the endemic wave with unexpected clinical severity in comparison with Asian countries.\n It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as host receptor and host proteases for cell surface binding and internalization.\n Thus, a predisposing genetic background can give reason for interindividual disease susceptibility and/or severity.\n Taking advantage of the Network of Italian Genomes (NIG), here we mined whole-exome sequencing data of 6930 Italian control individuals from five different centers looking for ACE2 variants.\n A number of variants with a potential impact on protein stability were identified.\n Among these, three more common missense changes, p.\n(Asn720Asp), p.\n(Lys26Arg), and p.\n(Gly211Arg) were predicted to interfere with protein structure and stabilization.\n Rare variants likely interfering with the internalization process, namely p.\n(Leu351Val) and p.\n(Pro389His), predicted to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding, were also observed.\n Comparison of ACE2 WES data between a cohort of 131 patients and 258 controls allowed identifying a statistically significant (P value &lt;?0.029) higher allelic variability in controls compared with patients.\n These findings suggest that a predisposing genetic background may contribute to the observed interindividual clinical variability associated with COVID-19, allowing an evidence-based risk assessment leading to personalized

and functional capacity by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score.\n Systemic manifestations, radiological damage evaluated by the Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug use, joint surgeries, and work disability were also assessed.\n The promoter region of the TNF-? gene, between nucleotides -1,318 and +49, was sequenced using an automated platform.\n Five hundred fifty-four patients were evaluated and genotyped for 10 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, but 5 of these markers were excluded due to failure to fall within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or to monomorphism.\n Patients with more than 10 years of disease duration (DD) presented significant associations between the -857 SNP and systemic manifestations, as well as joint surgeries.\n Associations were also found between the -308 SNP and work disability in patients with more than 2 years of DD and radiological damage in patients with less than 10 years of DD.\n A borderline effect was found between the -238 SNP and HAQ score and radiological damage in patients with 2 to 10 years of DD.\n An association was also found between haplotypes and the SvdH score for those with more than 10 years of DD.\n An association was found between some TNF-? promoter SNPs and systemic manifestations, radiological progression, HAQ score, work disability, and joint

expressions","abstract":"Background\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a widely studied cytokine (ligand) that induces proinflammatory signaling and regulates myriad cellular processes.\n\n In major illnesses, such as rheumatoid arthritis and certain cancers, the expression of TNF is elevated.\n\n Despite much progress in the field, the targeted regulation of TNF response for therapeutic benefits remains suboptimal.\n\n Here, to effectively regulate the proinflammatory response induced by TNF, a systems biology approach was adopted.\n\n\nResults\nWe developed a computational model to investigate the temporal activations of MAP kinase (p38), nuclear factor (NF)-?B, and the kinetics of 3 groups of genes, defined by early, intermediate and late phases, in murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) and 3T3 cells.\n\n To identify a crucial target that suppresses, and not abolishes, proinflammatory genes, the model was tested in several in silico knock out (KO) conditions.\n\n Among the candidate molecules tested, in silico RIP1 KO effectively regulated all groups of proinflammatory genes (early, middle and late).\n\n To validate this result, we experimentally inhibited TNF signaling in MEF and 3T3 cells with RIP1 inhibitor, Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), and investigated 10 genes (Il6, Nfkbia, Jun, Tnfaip3, Ccl7, Vcam1, Cxcl10, Mmp3, Mmp13, Enpp2) belonging to the 3 major groups of upregulated genes.\n\n As predicted by the model, all measured genes were significantly impaired.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results demonstrate that Nec-1 modulates TNF-induced proinflammatory response, and may potentially be used as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3832246","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kentaro","surname":"Hayashi","email":"hayaken@sfc.keio.ac.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincent","surname":"Piras","email":"vpiras@sfc.keio.ac.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sho","surname":"Tabata","email":"tabata@ttck.keio.ac.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Masaru","surname":"Tomita","email":"mt@sfc.keio.ac.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kumar","surname":"Selvarajoo","email":"kumar@ttck.keio.ac.jp","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/MCB.16.10.5579","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Two

ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 108 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and 177 healthy subjects.\n ?308 G/A TNF-? genotypes of patients and controls were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR).\n No significant association between the rs1800629 polymorphism and RA risk in the study cohort was observed.\n However, there were significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of the ?308 G/A TNF-? polymorphism between AS patients and the healthy subjects.\n In logistic regression analysis, the presence of the TNF-? ?308A allele in the genotype (AA + AG vs.\n GG) was associated with a 3.298 times lower risk of developing AS.\n In addition, in AS, there were associations for age at disease onset (&lt;29 years; odds ratio (OR) = 0.222), disease severity (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score &gt; 4; OR = 0.152) and response to anti-TNF treatment (OR = 2.25) under a dominant model (AA + AG vs.\n GG).\n In conclusion, our results suggested that the promoter polymorphism ?308 G/A in the TNF-? gene had no significant effect on RA development, but could play a role in AS development and in determining the age of disease onset, disease severity and therapeutic outcome of AS in the Bulgarian patients who participated in our

(TNF-?) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and duodenal ulcer (DU), but the results remain inconclusive.\n\n The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to investigate a more authentic association between TNF-? SNPs and DU.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed the meta-analysis by searching PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from the first available year to Sep.\n\n 5, 2012. Additionally, checking reference lists from identified articles, reviews, and the abstracts presented at related scientific societies meetings were also performed.\n\n All case-control studies investigating the association between TNF-? SNPs and DU risk were included.\n\n The association was assessed by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).\n\n Publication bias was analyzed by Begg's funnel plot and Egger's regression test.\n\n\nResults\nA total of sixteen studies reporting TNF-? ?308G/A, ?1031T/C, ?863C/A, ?857C/T, and ?238G/A polymorphism were included in our final meta-analysis.\n\n There was no statistically significant association between ?308G/A polymorphism and DU in the overall study population, as well as subgroup analyses by ethnicity, study design, and H.\n\n pylori status.\n\n As for ?1031T/C, ?863C/A, ?857C/T, and ?238G/A, results of our meta-analyses showed no statistical evidence of significant association.\n\n Power calculation on the combined sample size showed that the statistical powers were all lower than 80% for all the meta-analyses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe data suggests that there is no statistical evidence of significant association between the studied TNF-? SNPs and DU.\n\n However, this conclusion should be interpreted with caution as low statistical powers were revealed by power calculations.\n\n In future, larger sample-size studies with homogeneous DU patients and well-matched controls are required.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3579801","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Bei-Bei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xing-Zhen","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan-Wei","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qian-Qian","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xinping","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xinping","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.4049/jimmunol.164.12.6349","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Regulation of TNF expression by multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Adenosine-cyclic AMP pathways and cytokine expression","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00296-010-1392-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Meta-analysis of TNF-alpha promoter-308A/G polymorphism and SLE susceptibility in Asian populations","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.18632/oncotarget.22824","date":"2017-11-13","title":"The effects of tumor necrosis factor-?

influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus provides a difficult immunological challenge for the host, where a balance must be established between controlling viral replication and limiting damage to the delicate lung structure.\n Although the genetic architecture of host responses to respiratory viral infections is not yet understood, it is clear there is underlying heritability that influences pathogenesis.\n Immune control of virus replication is essential in respiratory infections, but overt activation can enhance inflammation and disease severity.\n Cytokines initiate antiviral immune responses but are implicated in viral pathogenesis.\n Here, we discuss how host genetic variation may influence cytokine responses to respiratory viral infections and, based on our current understanding of the role that cytokines play in viral pathogenesis, how this may influence disease severity.\n We also discuss how induced pluripotent stem cells may be utilised to probe the mechanistic implications of allelic variation in genes in virus-induced inflammatory responses.\n Ultimately, this could help to design better immune modulators, stratify high risk patients and tailor anti-inflammatory treatments, potentially expanding the ability to treat respiratory virus outbreaks in the future.\n","id":"PMC7658619","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jessica L.","surname":"Forbester","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ian

risk factor for childhood asthma.\n The pathogenic mechanisms responsible for RSV induced immunopathophysiology remain elusive.\n Using an age-appropriate mouse model of RSV, we show that IL-33 plays a critical role in the immunopathogenesis of severe RSV, which is associated with higher group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) specifically in neonates.\n Infection with RSV induced rapid IL-33 expression and an increase in ILC2 numbers in the lungs of neonatal mice; this was not observed in adult mice.\n Blocking IL-33 with antibodies or using an IL-33 receptor knockout mouse during infection was sufficient to inhibit RSV immunopathogenesis (i.\ne.\n, airway hyperresponsiveness, Th2 inflammation, eosinophilia, and mucus hyperproduction); whereas administration of IL-33 to adult mice during RSV infection was sufficient to induce RSV disease.\n Additionally, elevated IL-33 and IL-13 were observed in nasal aspirates from infants hospitalized with RSV; these cytokines declined during convalescence.\n In summary, IL-33 is necessary, either directly or indirectly, to induce ILC2s and the Th2 biased immunopathophysiology observed following neonatal RSV infection.\n This study provides a mechanism involving IL-33 and ILC2s in RSV mediated human

responses.\n In humans with respiratory virus infections, such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), elevated concentrations of IL-6 are associated with more severe disease.\n In contrast the polymorphisms in the Il6 promoter which favour lower IL-6 production are associated with increased risk of both RSV and Rhinovirus infections.\n To determine the precise contribution of IL-6 to protection and pathology we used murine models of respiratory virus infection.\n RSV infection resulted in increased IL-6 production both in the airways and systemically which remained heightened for at least 2 weeks.\n IL-6 depletion early, but not late, during RSV or Influenza A virus infection resulted in significantly increased disease associated with an influx of virus specific TH1 and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, whilst not affecting viral clearance.\n IL-6 acted by driving production of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-27 by macrophages and monocytes, which in turn promoted the local maturation of regulatory T cells.\n Concordantly IL-27 was necessary to regulate TH1 responses in the lungs, and sufficient to limit RSV induced disease.\n Overall we found that during respiratory virus infection the prototypic inflammatory cytokine IL-6 is a critical anti-inflammatory regulator of viral induced immunopathology in the respiratory tract through its induction of

Cytokine Production in the Lung during Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection","abstract":"Type I interferons (IFNs) are produced early upon virus infection and signal through the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-?/?) receptor (IFNAR) to induce genes that encode proteins important for limiting viral replication and directing immune responses.\n To investigate the extent to which type I IFNs play a role in the local regulation of inflammation in the airways, we examined their importance in early lung responses to infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).\n IFNAR1-deficient (IFNAR1?/?) mice displayed increased lung viral load and weight loss during RSV infection.\n As expected, expression of IFN-inducible genes was markedly reduced in the lungs of IFNAR1?/? mice.\n Surprisingly, we found that the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs of RSV-infected mice were also greatly reduced in the absence of IFNAR signaling.\n Furthermore, low levels of proinflammatory cytokines were also detected in the lungs of IFNAR1?/? mice challenged with noninfectious innate immune stimuli such as selected Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists.\n Finally, recombinant IFN-? was sufficient to potentiate the production of inflammatory mediators in the lungs of wild-type mice challenged with innate immune stimuli.\n Thus, in addition to its well-known role in antiviral resistance, type I IFN receptor signaling acts as a central driver of early proinflammatory responses in the lung.\n Inhibiting the effects of type I IFNs may therefore be useful in dampening inflammation in lung diseases characterized by enhanced inflammatory cytokine production.\n","id":"PMC4093897","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"Goritzka","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lydia

against type I IFNs in patients with life-threatening COVID-19","abstract":"The immune system is complex and involves many genes, including those that encode cytokines known as interferons (IFNs).\n Individuals that lack specific IFNs can be more susceptible to infectious diseases.\n Furthermore, the autoantibody system dampens IFN response to prevent damage from pathogen-induced inflammation.\n Two studies now examine the likelihood that genetics affects the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through components of this system (see the Perspective by Beck and Aksentijevich).\n Q.\n Zhang et al.\n used a candidate gene approach and identified patients with severe COVID-19 who have mutations in genes involved in the regulation of type I and III IFN immunity.\n They found enrichment of these genes in patients and conclude that genetics may determine the clinical course of the infection.\n Bastard et al.\n identified individuals with high titers of neutralizing autoantibodies against type I IFN-?2 and IFN-? in about 10% of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.\n These autoantibodies were not found either in infected people who were asymptomatic or had milder phenotype or in healthy individuals.\n Together, these studies identify a means by which individuals at highest risk of life-threatening COVID-19 can be identified.\n","id":"PMC7857397","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Bastard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lindsey

and Type III Interferons Drive Redundant Amplification Loops to Induce a Transcriptional Signature in Influenza-Infected Airway Epithelia","abstract":"Interferons (IFNs) are a group of cytokines with a well-established antiviral function.\n They can be induced by viral infection, are secreted and bind to specific receptors on the same or neighbouring cells to activate the expression of hundreds of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral function.\n Type I IFN has been known for more than half a century.\n However, more recently, type III IFN (IFN?, IL-28/29) was shown to play a similar role and to be particularly important at epithelial surfaces.\n Here we show that airway epithelia, the primary target of influenza A virus, produce both IFN I and III upon infection, and that induction of both depends on the RIG-I/MAVS pathway.\n While IRF3 is generally regarded as the transcription factor required for initiation of IFN transcription and the so-called “priming loop”, we find that IRF3 deficiency has little impact on IFN expression.\n In contrast, lack of IRF7 reduced IFN production significantly, and only IRF3?/?IRF7?/? double deficiency completely abolished it.\n The transcriptional response to influenza infection was largely dependent on IFNs, as it was reduced to a few upregulated genes in epithelia lacking receptors for both type I and III IFN (IFNAR1?/?IL-28R??/?).\n Wild-type epithelia and epithelia deficient in either the type I IFN receptor or the type III IFN receptor exhibit similar transcriptional profiles in response to virus, indicating that none of the induced genes depends selectively on only one IFN system.\n In chimeric mice, the lack of both IFN I and III signalling in the stromal compartment alone significantly increased the susceptibility to influenza infection.\n In conclusion, virus infection of airway epithelia induces, via a RIG-I/MAVS/IRF7 dependent pathway, both type I and III IFNs which drive two completely overlapping and redundant amplification loops to upregulate ISGs and protect from influenza infection.\n","id":"PMC3836735","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stefania","surname":"Crotta","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sophia","surname":"Davidson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tanel","surname":"Mahlakoiv","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christophe

studies have been used to identify loci for many major causes of human infectious mortality, including malaria, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, bacterial

genetic component to common disease susceptibility is encoded by multiple high frequency or rare variants, and the heretical view that most infectious diseases might even be monogenic has been advocated recently.\n Review of findings to date suggests that the genetic architecture of infectious disease susceptibility may be importantly different from that of non-infectious diseases, and it

restriction can be achieved when the viral nucleoprotein (NP) acquires the critical human-adaptive amino acid residues 100I/V, 283P, and 313Y.\n Here, we show that introduction of these three residues into the NP of an avian H5N1 virus renders it genetically unstable, resulting in viruses harboring additional single mutations, including G16D.\n These substitutions restored genetic stability yet again yielded viruses with varying degrees of attenuation in mammalian and avian cells.\n Additionally, most of the mutant viruses lost the capacity to escape MxA restriction, with the exception of the G16D virus.\n We show that MxA escape is linked to attenuation by demonstrating that the three substitutions promoting MxA escape disturbed intracellular trafficking of incoming viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs), thereby resulting in impaired nuclear import, and that the additional acquired mutations only partially compensate for this import block.\n We conclude that for adaptation to the human host, AIV must not only overcome MxA restriction but also an associated block in nuclear vRNP import.\n This inherent difficulty may partially explain the frequent failure of AIV to become

Moreover, murine Ifitm5 and 6 did not restrict IAV, but efficiently inhibited filovirus entry.\n We further demonstrate that replication of infectious SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and entry mediated by the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein are restricted by IFITM proteins.\n The profile of IFITM-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV was more similar to that of filoviruses than to IAV.\n Trypsin treatment of receptor-associated SARS-CoV pseudovirions, which bypasses their dependence on lysosomal cathepsin L, also bypassed IFITM-mediated restriction.\n However, IFITM proteins did not reduce cellular cathepsin activity or limit access of virions to acidic intracellular compartments.\n Our data indicate that IFITM-mediated restriction is localized to a late stage in the endocytic pathway.\n They further show that IFITM proteins differentially restrict the entry of a broad range of enveloped viruses, and modulate cellular tropism independently of viral receptor expression.\n","id":"PMC3017121","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"I-Chueh","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charles C.","surname":"Bailey","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica L.","surname":"Weyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sheli R.","surname":"Radoshitzky","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michelle M.","surname":"Becker","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica J.","surname":"Chiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abraham L.","surname":"Brass","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Asim A.","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoli","surname":"Chi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lian","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lindsay E.","surname":"Longobardi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dutch","surname":"Boltz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jens H.","surname":"Kuhn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephen J.","surname":"Elledge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sina","surname":"Bavari","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark R.","surname":"Denison","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hyeryun","surname":"Choe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Farzan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/nm.4370","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SNP-mediated disruption of CTCF binding at the IFITM3 promoter is associated with risk of severe influenza in humans","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature10921","date":"1970-01-01","title":"IFITM3 restricts the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza","abstract":"","id":"PMC3648786","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Aaron R.","surname":"Everitt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Clare","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Pertel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sinu P.","surname":"John","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rachael S.","surname":"Wash","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sarah E.","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Christopher R.","surname":"Chin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric M.","surname":"Feeley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jennifer S.","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David J.","surname":"Adams","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Helen M.","surname":"Wise","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leanne","surname":"Kane","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Goulding","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Digard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Verneri","surname":"Anttila","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.

quantities of cells for autologous transplantation as a novel treatment for a broad range of disorders1,2,3,4.\n However, the use of hIPSCs in the context of genetically inherited human disease will require correction of disease-causing mutations in a manner that is fully compatible with clinical applications3,5.\n The methods currently available, such as homologous recombination, lack the necessary efficiency and also leave residual sequences in the targeted genome6.\n Therefore, the development of new approaches to edit the mammalian genome is a prerequisite to delivering the clinical promise of hIPSCs.\n Here, we show that a combination of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)7 and piggyBac8,9 technology in hIPSCs can achieve bi-allelic correction of a point mutation (Glu342Lys) in the ?1-antitrypsin (A1AT, also called SERPINA1) gene that is responsible for ?1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD).\n Genetic correction of hIPSCs restored the structure and function of A1AT in subsequently derived liver cells in vitro and in vivo.\n This approach is significantly more efficient than any other gene targeting technology that is currently available and crucially prevents contamination of the host genome with residual non-human sequences.\n Our results provide the first proof of principle for the potential of combining hIPSCs with genetic correction to generate clinically relevant

X-linked recessive disorder environmentally conditioned by SARS-CoV-2. We investigated whether the two families represent the tip of the iceberg of a subset of COVID-19 male patients.\n\n\nMethods:\nThis is a nested case-control study in which we compared male participants with extreme phenotype selected from the Italian GEN-COVID cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected participants (&lt;60 y, 79 severe cases versus 77 control cases).\n\n We applied the LASSO Logistic Regression analysis, considering only rare variants on young male subsets with extreme phenotype, picking up TLR7 as the most important susceptibility gene.\n\n\nResults:\nOverall, we found TLR7 deleterious variants in 2.1% of severely affected males and in none of the asymptomatic participants.\n\n The functional gene expression profile analysis demonstrated a reduction in TLR7-related gene expression in patients compared with controls demonstrating an impairment in type I and II IFN responses.\n\n\nConclusions:\nYoung males with TLR7 loss-of-function variants and severe COVID-19

to COVID19 rise dramatically with age and co-existing health conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n Human genetic factors may contribute to the extremely high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and to the relentlessly progressive disease observed in a small but significant proportion of infected individuals, but these factors are largely unknown.\n\n\nMain body\nid='Par2'>In

(LDL) receptors with a role in cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular disease.\n It has since emerged as a major risk factor (causative gene) for Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.\n Detailed understanding of the structural features of the three isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4), which differ by only a single amino acid interchange, has elucidated their unique functions.\n ApoE2 and apoE4 increase the risk for heart disease: apoE2 increases atherogenic lipoprotein levels (it binds poorly to LDL receptors), and apoE4 increases LDL levels (it binds preferentially to triglyceride-rich, very low density lipoproteins, leading to downregulation of LDL receptors).\n ApoE4 also increases the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, decreases their age of onset, or alters their progression.\n ApoE4 likely causes neurodegeneration secondary to its abnormal structure, caused by an interaction between its carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains, called domain interaction.\n When neurons are stressed or injured, they synthesize apoE to redistribute cholesterol for neuronal repair or remodeling.\n However, because of its altered structure, neuronal apoE4 undergoes neuron-specific proteolysis, generating neurotoxic fragments (12–29 kDa) that escape the secretory pathway and cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal alterations, including tau phosphorylation.\n ApoE4-associated pathology can be prevented by small-molecule structure correctors that block domain interaction by converting apoE4 to a molecule that resembles apoE3 both structurally and functionally.\n Structure correctors are a potential therapeutic approach to reduce apoE4 pathology in both cardiovascular and neurological disorders.\n","id":"PMC4921111","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert

complication of systemic inflammatory disorders, most commonly systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n Clinical and laboratory features of MAS include sustained fever, hyperferritinemia, pancytopenia, fibrinolytic coagulopathy, and liver dysfunction.\n Soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (sCD25) and sCD163 may be elevated, and histopathology often reveals characteristic increased hemophagocytic activity in the bone marrow (and other tissues), with positive CD163 (histiocyte) staining.\n A common hypothesis as to the pathophysiology of many cases of MAS proposes a defect in lymphocyte cytolytic activity.\n Specific heterozygous gene mutations in familial HLH-associated cytolytic pathway genes (e.\ng.\n, PRF1, UNC13D) have been linked to a substantial subset of MAS patients.\n In addition, the pro-inflammatory cytokine environment, particularly IL-6, has been shown to decrease NK cell cytolytic function.\n The inability of NK cells and cytolytic CD8 T cells to lyse infected and otherwise activated antigen presenting cells results in prolonged cell-to-cell (innate and adaptive immune cells) interactions and amplification of a pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade.\n The cytokine storm results in activation of macrophages, causing hemophagocytosis, as well as contributing to multi-organ dysfunction.\n In addition to macrophages, dendritic cells likely play a critical role in antigen presentation to cytolytic lymphocytes, as well as contributing to cytokine expression.\n Several cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interferon-gamma, and numerous interleukins (i.\ne.\n, IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, IL-33), have been implicated in the cytokine cascade.\n In addition to broadly immunosuppressive therapies, novel cytokine targeted treatments are being explored to dampen the overly active immune response that is responsible for much of the pathology seen in MAS.\n","id":"PMC6367262","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Courtney

mild, moderate, and severe condition groups.\n A group of healthy donors (HD; n = 25) was included.\n Our data showed that solTNFR1 and solTNFR2 were elevated among the COVID-19 patients (p &lt; 0.0001), without increasing the transcriptional level.\n Only solTNFR1 was higher in the severe group as compared to the mildly ill (p &lt; 0.01), and the level was higher in COVID-19 patients who died than those that survived (p &lt; 0.0001).\n The solTNFR1 level had a discrete negative correlation with C-reactive protein (p = 0.006, Rho = ?0.33).\n The solADAM17 level was higher in severe as compared to mild disease conditions (p &lt; 0.01), as well as in COVID-19 patients who died as compared to those that survived (p &lt; 0.001).\n Additionally, a potential association between polymorphism TNFRSF1A:rs767455 and a severe degree of disease was suggested.\n These data suggest that solTNFR1 and solADAM17 are increased in severe conditions.\n solTNFR1 should be considered a potential target in the development of new therapeutic options.\n","id":"PMC8395100","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yadira","surname":"Palacios","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andy","surname":"Ruiz","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Andy","surname":"Ruiz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lucero

Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

Report","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage.\n\n Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care.\n\n Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P&lt;0.001).\n\n The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization.\n\n In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs.\n\n 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs.\n\n 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs.\n\n 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.\n\n

(COVID-19).\n\n\nObjective\nWe sought to determine whether particular cytokine profiles are associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nCytokine concentrations and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigen were measured at hospital admission in serum of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 (N = 115), classified at hospitalization into 3 respiratory severity groups: no need for mechanical ventilatory support (No-MVS), intermediate severity requiring mechanical ventilatory support (MVS), and critical severity requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\n Principal-component analysis was used to characterize cytokine profiles associated with severity and mortality.\n\n The results were thereafter confirmed in an independent validation cohort (N = 86).\n\n\nResults\nAt time of hospitalization, ECMO patients presented a dominant proinflammatory response with elevated levels of TNF-?, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. In contrast, an elevated type-I interferon response involving IFN-? and IFN-? was characteristic of No-MVS patients, whereas MVS patients exhibited both profiles.\n\n Mortality at 1 month was associated with higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in ECMO patients, higher levels of type-I interferons in No-MVS patients, and their combination in MVS patients, resulting in a combined mortality prediction accuracy of 88.5% (risk ratio, 24.3; P &lt; .\n\n0001).\n\n Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigen levels correlated with type-I interferon levels and were associated with mortality, but not with proinflammatory response or severity.\n\n\nConclusions\nDistinct cytokine profiles are observed in association with COVID-19 severity and are differentially predictive of mortality according to oxygen support modalities.\n\n These results warrant personalized treatment of COVID-19 patients based on cytokine profiling.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8061091","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Karim","surname":"Dorgham","email":"NULL","contributions":"8"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Quentric","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Mehmet","surname":"Gökkaya","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stéphane","surname":"Marot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Parizot","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Delphine","surname":"Sauce","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amélie","surname":"Guihot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charles-Edouard","surname":"Luyt","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Matthieu","surname":"Schmidt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Julien","surname":"Mayaux","email":"NULL","contributions":"6"},{"firstname":"Alexandra","surname":"Beurton","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Loic","surname":"Le Guennec","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sophie","surname":"Demeret","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elyes","surname":"Ben Salah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexis","surname":"Mathian","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Hans","surname":"Yssel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Béhazine","surname":"Combadiere","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Combadiere","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claudia","surname":"Traidl-Hoffmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sonia","surname":"Burrel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anne-Geneviève","surname":"Marcelin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zahir","surname":"Amoura","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Guillaume","surname":"Voiriot","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Avidan U.","surname":"Neumann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guy","surname":"Gorochov","email":"NULL","contributions":"6"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Structural and functional basis of SARS-CoV-2 entry by using human ACE2","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cytokine release syndrome in severe COVID-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The immunobiology of SARS*","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association between administration of systemic corticosteroids and mortality among critically ill patients with COVID-19: a meta-analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A new Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) based on a European/North American multicenter study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hingrat QL, Visseaux B, Laouenan C, Tubiana S, Bouadma L, Yazdanpanah Y, et al.

more sensitive than the detection of the S1 or S2 subunits.\n Using retroviral particles pseudotyped with the spike of the SARS-CoV-2, we also monitored the presence of neutralizing antibodies in these samples as well as 25 samples from asymptomatic individuals that were shown SARS-CoV-2 seropositive using commercial serological tests.\n Neutralizing antibodies reached a plateau 2 weeks

The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively.\n\n The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness.\n\n The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately.\n\n The presence of antibodies was &lt;40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset.\n\n In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p&lt;0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007).\n\n Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184337","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Quan","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Haiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuejiao","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yingying","surname":"Su","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tingdong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jinxiu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shen","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Congming","surname":"Hong","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Fuxiang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yingxia","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoqin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tianying","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Shengxiang","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ningshao","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangzheng1975@aliyun.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3389/fimmu.2021.632814","date":"2021-02-04","title":"The Characterization of Disease Severity Associated IgG Subclasses Response in COVID-19 Patients","abstract":"Increasing evidence suggests that dysregulated immune responses are associated with the clinical outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n Nucleocapsid protein (NP)-, spike (S)-, receptor binding domain (RBD)- specific immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes, IgG subclasses and neutralizing antibody (NAb) were analyzed in 123 serum from 63 hospitalized patients with severe, moderate, mild or asymptomatic COVID-19.

reservoir, and epidemiologic studies.\n We developed serologic assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike protein–specific, and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies.\n Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs.\n We demonstrated that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2–infected persons seroconverted by 2 weeks after disease onset.\n We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity, and sensitivity varied between the 2 assays; the IgA ELISA showed higher sensitivity.\n Overall, the validated assays described can be instrumental for detection of SARS-CoV-2–specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiologic, and vaccine evaluation studies.\n","id":"PMC7323511","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nisreen

Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

group was compared with the mild/moderate group, significant risk factors included: older age; dyspnea; hypertension; poor appetite; fatigue; higher white cell count, neutrophil count, prothrombin time, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein; and lower lymphocyte count and albumin (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n In the intensive care unit (ICU) group compared with the non-ICU group, risk factors included: older age; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); dyspnea; poor appetite; higher white cell count, D-dimer, ALT, AST and LDH; and lower lymphocyte count and albumin (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n Independent risk factors associated with the severe/critical group were dyspnea [odds ratio (OR)?=?19.48], ALT (OR?=?6.02) and albumin (OR?=?3.36).\n\n Independent risk factors associated with the ICU group were dyspnea (OR?=?8.88), COPD (OR?=?31.80), D-dimer (OR?=?8.37), ALT (OR?=?28.76) and LDH (OR?=?9.95) (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe severity of COVID-19 outside Wuhan, China was milder than that within Wuhan.\n\n The clinical infective period was long, and the longest virus shedding time was 35?days.\n\n The most important risk factors were dyspnea, COPD, D-dimer, ALT, LDH and albumin.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7649871","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xingsheng","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chunhong","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yajing","surname":"Wen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiangyu","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s12250-020-00329-9","date":"2020-11-23","title":"Viral

SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG serology assays and describe the kinetics of IgM and IgG seroconversion observed in patients with PCR confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to our hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nWe validated the performance of the Diazyme assay in 235 subjects to determine specificity.\n\n Subsequently, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG seroconversion of 54 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and determined sensitivity of the assay at three different timeframes.\n\n\nResult\nSensitivity and specificity for detecting seropositivity at???15 days following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, was 100.0% and 98.7% when assaying for the panel of IgM and IgG.\n\n The median time to seropositivity observed for a reactive IgM and IgG result from the date of a positive PCR was 5 days (IQR:

were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

province of China was isolated in January 2020. This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens.\n\n\nResults\nNone of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20–83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.\n\n Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache.\n\n Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia.\n\n Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography

widespread impact recently.\n\n We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID?19 children with different severities and allergic status.\n\n\nMethods\nData extracted from the electronic medical records, including demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, laboratory and immunological results, and radiological images of 182 hospitalized COVID?19 children, were summarized and analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age was 6 years, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there were more boys (male?female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients.\n\n Most of the children were infected by family members.\n\n Fever (43.4%) and dry cough (44.5%) were common symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for 11.0%, including diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting.\n\n 71.4% had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were ground?glass opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission.\n\n Laboratory results were mostly within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%) and eosinopenia (29.5%) were observed.\n\n The majority (97.8%) of infected children were not severe, and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomatic infections.\n\n Compared to children without pneumonia (manifested as asymptomatic and acute upper respiratory infection), children with pneumonia were associated with higher percentages of the comorbidity history, symptoms of fever and cough, and increased levels of serum procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum interleukins (IL)?2, IL?4, IL?6, IL?10, and TNF??.\n\n There were no differences in treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from first positive to first negative nucleic acid testing, and outcomes between children with mild pneumonia and without pneumonia.\n\n All the hospitalized COVID?19 children had recovered except one death due to intussusception and sepsis.\n\n In 43 allergic children with COVID?19, allergic rhinitis (83.7%) was the major disease, followed by drug allergy, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and asthma.\n\n Demographics and clinical features were not significantly different between allergic and nonallergic groups.\n\n Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants, procalcitonin, D?dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared with all patients.\n\n Immunological profiles including circulating T, B, and NK lymphocyte subsets, total immunoglobulin and complement levels, and serum cytokines did not show any difference in allergic and pneumonia groups.\n\n Neither eosinophil counts nor serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels showed a significant correlation with other immunological measures, such as other immunoglobulins, complements, lymphocyte subset numbers, and serum cytokine levels.\n\n\nConclusion\nPediatric COVID?19 patients tended to have a mild clinical course.\n\n Patients with pneumonia had higher proportion of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers than those without pneumonia.\n\n There was no difference between allergic and nonallergic COVID?19 children in disease incidence, clinical features, and laboratory and immunological findings.\n\n Allergy was not a risk factor for developing and severity of SARS?CoV?2 infection and hardly influenced the disease course of COVID?19 in

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater

SARS-CoV-2 viral load in respiratory specimens has been widely used to diagnose coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of COVID-19 patients.\n\n However, it is not clear whether testing for RNAaemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n The patients were divided into three groups according to the “Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition)” issued by the National Health Commission of China.\n\n The clinical and laboratory data were collected.\n\n The serum viral load and IL-6 levels were determined.\n\n .\n\n\nResults\nClinical characteristics analysis of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAaemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease.\n\n Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients.\n\n More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAaemia (R = 0.902).\n\n\nConclusions\nDetectable serum SARS-Cov-2 RNA(RNAaemia) in COVID-19 patients was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis.\n\n Because the elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm which could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients with an excessive inflammatory

included 11 932 participants for the hydroxychloroquine group, 8081 for the hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin group and 12 930 for the control group.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with mortality: pooled relative risk (RR) 0.83 (95% CI 0.65–1.06, n = 17 studies) for all studies and RR = 1.09 (95% CI 0.97–1.24, n = 3 studies) for randomized controlled trials.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin was associated with an increased mortality (RR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.04–1.54, n = 7 studies).\n\n We found similar results with a Bayesian meta-analysis.\n\n\nConclusion\nHydroxychloroquine alone was not associated with reduced mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients but the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin significantly increased mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7449662","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thibault","surname":"Fiolet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anthony","surname":"Guihur","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mathieu

between HCQ therapy and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nIn a retrospective observational study, 3,451 unselected patients hospitalized in 33 clinical centers in Italy, from February 19, 2020 to May 23, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, were analyzed.\n\n The primary end-point in a time-to event analysis was in-hospital death, comparing patients who received HCQ

analyses.\n\n\nResults\nOut of 3,451 COVID-19 patients, 76.3% received HCQ.\n\n Death rates (per 1,000 person-days) for patients receiving or not HCQ were 8.9 and 15.7, respectively.\n\n After

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41

We aimed to determine the presence of these rare variants in young men with severe COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe prospectively studied males between 18 and 50 years-old without predisposing comorbidities that required at least high-flow nasal oxygen to treat COVID-19. The coding region of TLR7 was sequenced to assess the presence of potentially deleterious variants.\n\n\nResults\n\nTLR7 missense variants were identified in two out of 14 patients (14.3%).\n\n Overall, the median age was 38 (IQR 30-45) years.\n\n Both variants were not previously reported in population control databases and were predicted to be damaging by in silico predictors.\n\n In a 30-year-old patient a maternally inherited variant [c.\n\n644A&gt;G; p.\n\n(Asn215Ser)] was identified, co-segregating in his 27-year-old brother who also contracted severe COVID-19. A second variant [c.\n\n2797T&gt;C; p.\n\n(Trp933Arg)] was found in a 28-year-old patient, co-segregating in his 24-year-old brother who developed mild COVID-19. Functional testing of this variant revealed decreased type I and II interferon responses in peripheral mononuclear blood cells upon stimulation with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod, confirming a loss-of-function effect.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study supports a rationale for the genetic screening for TLR7 variants in young men with severe COVID-19 in the absence of other relevant risk factors.\n\n A diagnosis of TLR7 deficiency could not only inform on treatment options for the patient, but also enables pre-symptomatic testing of at-risk male relatives with the possibility of instituting early preventive and therapeutic interventions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8343010","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"Solanich","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gardenia","surname":"Vargas-Parra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caspar I.","surname":"van der Made","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Annet","surname":"Simons","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Janneke","surname":"Schuurs-Hoeijmakers","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Arnau","surname":"Antolí","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Jesús","surname":"del Valle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gemma","surname":"Rocamora-Blanch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fernando","surname":"Setién","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Manel","surname":"Esteller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simon V.","surname":"van Reijmersdal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antoni","surname":"Riera-Mestre","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joan","surname":"Sabater-Riera","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabriel","surname":"Capellá","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frank L.","surname":"van de Veerdonk","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"van der Hoven","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"Corbella","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexander","surname":"Hoischen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Conxi","surname":"Lázaro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.mgene.2021.100867","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Frequencies of Apolipoprotein E polymorphism in Iraqi Kurdish population","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]}]}]}
