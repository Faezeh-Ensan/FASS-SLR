The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25,

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

COVID-19 are limited.\n\n\nObjective\nWe sought to evaluate the severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020, to February 5, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model.\n\n Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission.\n\n Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-?), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission.\n\n The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan.\n\n The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period.\n\n Survival analysis revealed that male sex, older age, leukocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19.\nConclusions\nPatients with older age, hypertension, and high lactate dehydrogenase level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19.

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and

disease rehabilitation patients","abstract":"Background:\nA patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta.\n\n The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear.\n\n This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively.\n\n The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients’ oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed.\n\n Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs.\n\n The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.\n\n\nResults:\nIn the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study.\n\n In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0–62.0) years were analyzed.\n\n After in-hospital treatment, patients’ inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition.\n\n The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0–11.0) days.\n\n By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients’ stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0–16.0) days after symptom onset.\n\n Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0–4.0) days.\n\n Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients’ urine specimens after throat swabs were negative.\n\n Using a multiple linear regression model (F?=?2.669, P?=?0.044, and adjusted R2?=?0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients’ stools (t?=??2.699, P?=?0.010).\n\n The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs.\n\n 8.0 days, respectively; t?=?2.550, P?=?0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs.\n\n 11 days, respectively; t?=?4.631, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P?&gt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions:\nIn brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients’ stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence.\n\n Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease.\n\n The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shui-Bao","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-Xiao","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Di","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Qin","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bi-Jie","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"En-Qiang","surname":"Mao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-Hong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong-Zhou","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

and Laboratory Features of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Vis-À-Vis Onset of Fever","abstract":"Study objectives:\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a rapidly progressive disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) infection.\n\n However, the disease presentation is nonspecific.\n\n The aim of this study was to define clearly the presentation, clinical progression, and laboratory data in a group of patients who had SARS.\n\n\nDesign:\nRetrospective observational study.\n\n\nSetting:\nA tertiary care medical center with 51 negative-pressure isolation rooms in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\n\nPatients:\nFifty-three patients with SARS seen between April 27 and June 16, 2003.\nResults:\nFever (ie, temperature &gt; 38°C) was the most common symptom (98%) and the earliest.\n\n When admitted to the isolation unit of the hospital for observation, most patients reported nonspecific symptoms associated with their fever.\n\n Only two patients with preexisting illnesses had cough on the same day the fever began.\n\n Eventually, 39 patients (74%) developed cough, beginning at a mean (± SD) time of 4.5 ± 1.9 days after fever onset, and 35 patients (66%) had diarrhea beginning at a mean time of 6.0 ± 3.3 days after fever onset.\n\n Thirty-one patients (59%) had abnormal findings on chest radiographs on hospital admission, and all but 1 patient (98%) eventually developed lung infiltrates that were consistent with pneumonia.\n\n The majority of patients (63%) first developed unifocal infiltrates at a mean time of 4.5 ± 2.1 days after fever onset, while in 37% of patients the initial infiltrates were multifocal, appearing at a mean time of 5.8 ± 1.3 days after fever onset.\n\n Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia (on hospital admission, 70%; during hospitalization, 95%), thrombocytopenia (on hospital admission, 28%; during hospitalization, 40%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (on hospital admission, 58%; during hospitalization, 88%), creatine kinase (on hospital admission, 18%; during hospitalization, 32%), and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels (on hospital admission, 27%; during hospitalization, 62%).\n\n Throat or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR was positive in 40 of the 47 patients (85%) in whom the test was performed.\n\n\nConclusions:\nNone of the presenting symptoms or laboratory findings are pathognomonic for SARS.\n\n Even though cough developed in a majority of patients, it did not occur until later in the disease course, suggesting that a cough preceding or concurrent with the onset of fever is less likely to indicate SARS.\n\n While PCR for SARS-CoV appears to be the best early diagnostic test currently available, it is clear that better methods are needed to differentiate between SARS and non-SARS illness on initial

populations.\n Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic.\n In order to assess the potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants.\n Recommendations are also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials, and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.\n","id":"PMC7077337","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David

China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020, to February 5, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model.\n\n Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission.\n\n Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-?), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission.\n\n The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan.\n\n The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period.\n\n Survival analysis revealed that male sex, older age, leukocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19.\nConclusions\nPatients with older age, hypertension, and high lactate dehydrogenase level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19.

unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was

with COVID-19 treated in Hubei (epicentre) and outside Hubei (non-epicentre): a nationwide analysis of China","abstract":"Background\nDuring the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), consistent and considerable differences in disease severity and mortality rate of patients treated in Hubei province compared to those in other parts of China have been observed.\n\n We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these differences.\n\n\nMethods\nCollaborating with the National Health Commission, we established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalised COVID-19 cases in China.\n\n Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and the time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients within and outside Hubei.\n\n The impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed key factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicentre as well the administrative centre of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission on prognosis were also determined.\n\n\nResults\nAt the data cut-off (31 January 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort).\n\n The overall rate of severe cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively.\n\n Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597 (92.3%) out of 647) were older (mean age 49.7 versus 44.9?years), had more cases with comorbidity (32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5?days) compared with patients outside Hubei.\n\n Patients in Hubei (severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, HR (95% CI) for critical illness 1.59 (1.05–2.41)) have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity.\n\n However, among patients outside Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean 4.4 versus 4.7?days) and prognosis (HR (95%) 0.84 (0.40–1.80)) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure.\n\n In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in

cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on

were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in

of 32 genomes of virus strains sampled from China, Thailand, and the USA with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020 were analyzed.\n Phylogenetic, transmission network, and likelihood?mapping analyses of the genome sequences were performed.\n On the basis of the likelihood?mapping analysis, the increasing tree?like signals (from 0% to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time may be indicative of increasing genetic diversity of 2019?nCoV in human hosts.\n We identified three phylogenetic clusters using the Bayesian inference framework and three transmission clusters using transmission network analysis, with only one cluster identified by both methods using the above genome sequences of 2019?nCoV strains.\n The estimated mean evolutionary rate for 2019?nCoV ranged from 1.7926 ×?10?3 to 1.8266?×?10?3 substitutions per site per year.\n On the basis of our study, undertaking epidemiological investigations and genomic data surveillance could positively impact public

Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic.\n Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.","id":"PMC7139239","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Amr H.","surname":"Sawalha","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Coit","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qianjin","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Michaud K, Wipfler K, Shaw Y, Simon TA, Cornish A, England BR, Ogdie A, Katz P (2020) Experiences of patients with rheumatic diseases in the US during early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients","abstract":"Background:\nA patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta.\n\n The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear.\n\n This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively.\n\n The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients’ oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed.\n\n Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs.\n\n The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.\n\n\nResults:\nIn the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study.\n\n In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0–62.0) years were analyzed.\n\n After in-hospital treatment, patients’ inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition.\n\n The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0–11.0) days.\n\n By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients’ stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0–16.0) days after symptom onset.\n\n Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0–4.0) days.\n\n Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients’ urine specimens after throat swabs were negative.\n\n Using a multiple linear regression model (F?=?2.669, P?=?0.044, and adjusted R2?=?0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients’ stools (t?=??2.699, P?=?0.010).\n\n The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs.\n\n 8.0 days, respectively; t?=?2.550, P?=?0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs.\n\n 11 days, respectively; t?=?4.631, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P?&gt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions:\nIn brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients’ stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence.\n\n Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease.\n\n The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shui-Bao","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-Xiao","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Di","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Qin","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bi-Jie","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"En-Qiang","surname":"Mao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-Hong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong-Zhou","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/cid/ciaa351","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Factors

limited on the duration and host factors related to viral shedding.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective study, risk factors associated with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a cohort of 113 symptomatic patients from two hospitals outside Wuhan.\n\n\nResults\nThe median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 days (Interquartile Range [IQR], 13–22 days) as measured from illness onset.\n\n When comparing patients with early (&lt;15 days) and late viral RNA clearance (?15 days after illness onset), prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (p=0.009), old age (p=0.033), concomitated with hypertension (p=0.009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (p=0.001), severe illness at admission (p=0.049),

However, the efficacy of corticosteroids, commonly utilized antiinflammatory agents, to treat COVID-19-induced CRS is controversial.\n There is an urgent need for novel therapies to treat COVID-19-induced CRS.\n Here, we discuss the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-induced CRS, compare the CRS in COVID-19 with that in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and summarize the existing therapies for CRS.\n We propose to utilize interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade to manage COVID-19-induced CRS and discuss several factors that should be taken into consideration for its clinical application.\n","id":"PMC7151347","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Bingwen","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhiguang","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuan","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yufei","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ACE2: from vasopeptidase to SARS virus receptor","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology.

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

and 235 were male.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia.\n\n Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.\n\n Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines.\n\n The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases.\n\n Both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in

with drastically elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) level in critically ill COVID-19 patients","abstract":"Background\nAlthough the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in respiratory specimens has been widely used to diagnose coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of COVID-19 patients.\n\n However, it is not clear whether testing for RNAaemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n The patients were divided into three groups according to the “Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition)” issued by the National Health Commission of China.\n\n The clinical and laboratory data were collected.\n\n The serum viral load and IL-6 levels were determined.\n\n .\n\n\nResults\nClinical characteristics analysis of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAaemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease.\n\n Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients.\n\n More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAaemia (R = 0.902).\n\n\nConclusions\nDetectable serum SARS-Cov-2 RNA(RNAaemia) in COVID-19 patients was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis.\n\n Because the elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm which could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients with an excessive inflammatory response.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184354","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaohua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Binghong","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yueming","surname":"Qu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yurou","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong","surname":"Men","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qianchuan","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinya","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Li","email":"fli222@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}],"References

characteristics","abstract":"Objectives\nTo assess the clinical severity of COVID-19 pneumonia using qualitative and/or quantitative chest CT indicators and identify the CT characteristics of critical cases.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nFifty-one patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including ordinary cases (group A, n=12), severe cases(group B, n=15) and critical cases (group C, n=24) were retrospectively enrolled.\n\n The qualitative and quantitative indicators from chest CT were recorded and compared using Fisher's exact test, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis H test and receiver operating characteristic analysis.\n\n\nResults\nDepending on the severity of the disease, the number of involved lung segments and lobes, the frequencies of consolidation, crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram increased in more severe cases.\n\n Qualitative indicators including total severity score for the whole lung and total score for crazy-paving and consolidation could distinguish groups B and C from A(69% sensitivity, 83% specificity and 73% accuracy) but were similar between group B and group C.\n\n Combined qualitative and quantitative indicators could distinguish these three groups with high sensitivity(B+C vs.\n\n A, 90%; C vs.\n\n B, 92%), specificity(100%, 87%) and accuracy(92%, 90%).\n\n Critical cases had higher total severity score(&gt;10) and higher total score for crazy-paving and consolidation(&gt;4) than ordinary cases, and had higher mean lung density(&gt;-779HU) and full width at half maximum(&gt;128HU) but lower relative volume of normal lung density(?50%) than ordinary/severe cases.\n\n In our critical cases, eight patients with relative volume of normal lung density smaller than 40% received mechanical ventilation for supportive treatment, and two of them had died.\n\n\nConclusion\nA rapid, accurate severity assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia based on chest CT would be feasible and could provide help for making management decisions, especially for the critical cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7173027","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Peijie","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xing","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianbo","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been characterized by fever, respiratory, and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as shedding of virus RNA into feces.\n\n We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published gastrointestinal symptoms and detection of virus in stool and also summarized data from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected data from the cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong (N = 59; diagnosis from February 2 through February 29, 2020),and searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and 3 Chinese databases through March 11, 2020, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\n\n We analyzed pooled data on the prevalence of overall and individual gastrointestinal symptoms (loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort) using a random effects model.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 59 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 15 patients (25.4%) had gastrointestinal symptoms, and 9 patients (15.3%) had stool that tested positive for virus RNA.\n\n Stool viral RNA was detected in 38.5% and 8.7% among those with and without diarrhea, respectively (P = .\n\n02).\n\n The median fecal viral load was 5.1 log10 copies per milliliter in patients with diarrhea vs 3.9 log10 copies per milliliter in patients without diarrhea (P = .\n\n06).\n\n In a meta-analysis of 60 studies comprising 4243 patients, the pooled prevalence of all gastrointestinal symptoms was 17.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.3–24.5); 11.8% of patients with nonsevere COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 4.1–29.1), and 17.1% of patients with severe COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 6.9–36.7).\n\n In the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of stool samples that were positive for virus RNA was 48.1% (95% CI, 38.3–57.9); of these samples, 70.3% of those collected after loss of virus from respiratory specimens tested positive for the virus (95% CI, 49.6–85.1).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn an analysis of data from the Hong Kong cohort of patients with COVID-19 and a meta-analysis of findings from publications, we found that 17.6% of patients with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n Virus RNA was detected in stool samples from 48.1% patients, even in stool collected after respiratory samples had negative test results.\n\n Health care workers should therefore exercise caution in collecting fecal samples or performing endoscopic procedures in patients with COVID-19, even during patient recovery.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7194936","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ka

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward

the effects of 229E itself.\n Tests on volunteers' preinfection sera showed that the prevalence of antibody to 229E had increased during the period 1961–1979 and that during 1977–1979 only 11% of subjects had no neutralising antibody against 229E.\n Susceptibility to the 229E?related isolates PR and TO was associated with low preinfection serum neutralising antibody against the homologous virus, and paired sera frequently showed fourfold or greater antibody rises, most commonly against the homologous strain.\n Volunteers infected with TO were immune when reinoculated with the same

features of the human disease are duplicated in BALB/c mice infected with a mouse-adapted version of the virus (MA15), which develop respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality.\n Here, we show that severe disease is correlated with slow kinetics of virus clearance and delayed activation and transit of respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) to the draining lymph nodes (DLN) with a consequent deficient virus-specific T cell response.\n All of these defects are corrected when mice are treated with liposomes containing clodronate, which deplete alveolar macrophages (AM).\n Inhibitory AMs are believed to prevent the development of immune responses to environmental antigens and allergic responses by interacting with lung dendritic cells and T cells.\n The inhibitory effects of AM can also be nullified if mice or AMs are pretreated with poly I:C, which directly activate AMs and rDCs through toll-like receptors 3 (TLR3).\n Further, adoptive transfer of activated but not resting bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (BMDC) protect mice from lethal MA15 infection.\n These results may be relevant for SARS in humans, which is also characterized by prolonged virus persistence and

more than 700 deaths worldwide.\n Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear.\n Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice.\n In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection.\n Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88?/?), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection.\n The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection.\n MyD88?/? mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection.\n Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88?/? mice compared to wild-type mice.\n Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88?/?mice.\n These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung are required for protection from lethal rMA15

diffuse alveolar damage, especially in the elderly.\n The virus-host interactions that governed development of these acute end stage lung diseases and death are unknown.\n To address this question, we evaluated the role of innate immune signaling in protection from human (Urbani) and a recombinant mouse adapted SARS-CoV, designated rMA15. In contrast to most models of viral pathogenesis, infection of type I, type II or type III interferon knockout mice (129 background) with either Urbani or MA15 viruses resulted in clinical disease outcomes, including transient weight loss, denuding bronchiolitis and alveolar inflammation and recovery, identical to that seen in infection of wildtype mice.\n This suggests that type I, II and III interferon signaling play minor roles in regulating SARS pathogenesis in mouse models.\n In contrast, infection of STAT1?/? mice resulted in severe disease, high virus titer, extensive pulmonary lesions and 100% mortality by day 9 and 30 post-infection with rMA15 or Urbani viruses, respectively.\n Non-lethal in BALB/c mice, Urbani SARS-CoV infection in STAT1?/? mice caused disseminated infection involving the liver, spleen and other tissues after day 9. These findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV pathogenesis is regulated by a STAT1 dependent but type I, II and III interferon receptor independent, mechanism.\n In contrast to a well documented role in innate immunity, we propose that STAT1 also protects mice via its role as an antagonist of unrestrained cell proliferation.\n","id":"PMC2851658","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthew B.","surname":"Frieman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas E.","surname":"Morrison","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Whitmore","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"William","surname":"Funkhouser","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jerrold M.","surname":"Ward","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elaine W.","surname":"Lamirande","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anjeanette","surname":"Roberts","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Heise","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kanta","surname":"Subbarao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Gale","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Gale","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/nm.2972","date":"2012-09-14","title":"A live, impaired-fidelity coronavirus vaccine protects in an aged, immunocompromised mouse model of lethal disease","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nm.\n\n2972) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3518599","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rachel L","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michelle M","surname":"Becker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lance D","surname":"Eckerle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Meagan","surname":"Bolles","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Mark R","surname":"Denison","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ralph S","surname":"Baric","email":"rbaric@email.unc.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.virol.2008.07.026","date":"2008-07-17","title":"An immunosuppressed Syrian golden hamster model for SARS-CoV infection","abstract":"Several small animal models have been developed for the study of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication and pathogenesis.\n Syrian golden hamsters are among the best small animal models, though little clinical illness and no mortality are observed after virus infection.\n Cyclophosphamide was used to immunosuppress hamsters leading to a prolonged disease course and higher mortality after SARS-CoV infection.\n In addition, there was a significant weight loss, expanded tissue tropism, and increased viral pathology in the lung, heart, kidney, and nasal turbinate tissues.\n Infection with recombinant SARS-CoV viruses bearing disruptions in the gene 7 coding region showed no significant change in replication kinetics, tissue tropism, morbidity, or mortality suggesting that the ORF7a (7a) and ORF7b (7b) proteins are not required for virus replication in immunosuppressed hamsters.\n This modified hamster model may provide a useful tool for SARS-CoV pathogenesis studies, evaluation of antiviral therapy, and analysis of additional SARS-CoV mutants.\n","id":"PMC3722600","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Scott R.","surname":"Schaecher","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jennifer","surname":"Stabenow","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christina","surname":"Oberle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jill","surname":"Schriewer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R.

similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV.\n\n We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks.\n\n To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS.\n\n We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data.\n\n\nResults\nWith our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R0 to be 0·69 (95% CI 0·50–0·92); by contrast, the R0 for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 0·80 (0·54–1·13).\n\n Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R0 of 0·60 (0·42–0·80).\n\n Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient.\n\n Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R0 would exceed 1—ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential.\n\n We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.\n\n\nFunding\nAgence Nationale de la Recherche (Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases), and the European Community's

virion as a vaccine candidate, we subcutaneously immunized mice with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV with or without an adjuvant.\n We chose aluminum hydroxide gel (alum) as an adjuvant, because of its long safety history for human use.\n We observed that the UV-inactivated SARS-CoV virion elicited a high level of humoral immunity, resulting in the generation of long-term antibody secreting and memory B cells.\n With the addition of alum to the vaccine formula, serum IgG production was augmented and reached a level similar to that found in hyper-immunized mice, though it was still insufficient to elicit serum IgA antibodies.\n Notably, the SARS-CoV virion itself was able to induce long-term antibody production even without an adjuvant.\n Anti-SARS-CoV antibodies elicited in mice recognized both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of the virus and were able to neutralize the virus.\n Furthermore, the UV-inactivated virion induced regional lymph node T-cell proliferation and significant levels of cytokine production (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IFN-? and TNF-?) upon restimulation with inactivated SARS-CoV virion in vitro.\n Thus, a whole killed virion could serve as a candidate antigen for a SARS vaccine to elicit both humoral and cellular immunity.\n","id":"PMC7108621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Naomi","surname":"Takasuka","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hideki","surname":"Fujii","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yoshimasa","surname":"Takahashi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Masataka","surname":"Kasai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shigeru","surname":"Morikawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shigeyuki","surname":"Itamura","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Koji","surname":"Ishii","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Masahiro","surname":"Sakaguchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kazuo","surname":"Ohnishi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Masamichi","surname":"Ohshima","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shu-ichi","surname":"Hashimoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Takato","surname":"Odagiri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Masato","surname":"Tashiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hiroshi","surname":"Yoshikura","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Toshitada","surname":"Takemori","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yasuko","surname":"Tsunetsugu-Yokota","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.10.052","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Inactivated

being tested in clinical trial consists of inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome-associate coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n However, limited information is available about host immune responses induced by the inactivated SARS vaccine.\n In this study, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV inactivated by ?-propiolactone elicited high titers of antibodies in the immunized mice and rabbits that recognize the spike (S) protein, especially the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 region.\n The antisera from the immunized animals efficiently bound to the RBD and blocked binding of RBD to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the functional receptor on the susceptible cells for SARS-CoV.\n With a sensitive and quantitative single-cycle infection assay using pseudovirus bearing the SARS-CoV S protein, we demonstrated that mouse and rabbit antisera significantly inhibited S protein-mediated virus entry with mean 50% inhibitory titers of 1:7393 and 1:2060, respectively.\n These data suggest that the RBD of S protein is a major neutralization determinant in the inactivated SARS vaccine which can induce potent neutralizing antibodies to block SARS-CoV entry.\n However, caution

Efficacy in Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice.\n\n VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Damon","surname":"Deming","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Heise","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boyd","surname":"Yount","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mehul","surname":"Suthar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jack","surname":"Harkema","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Whitmore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Raymond","surname":"Pickles","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ande","surname":"West","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Donaldson","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Kristopher","surname":"Curtis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Johnston","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ralph","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/978-0-387-33012-9_101","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Sars

found that most anti-rN protein antibodies were IgG2a in BALB/c mice vaccinated with rN emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 containing the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide, CpG.\n In contrast, anti-rN protein antibodies of mice immunized with rN protein in PBS were found to mainly be IgG1. These results indicated that ISA-51/CpG-formulated rN protein was dramatically biased toward a Th1 immune response.\n To identify the B-cell immunodominant epitopes of the rN protein in the mouse and monkey, the reactivities of antisera raised against purified rN proteins formulated in ISA-51/CpG were tested with a panel of overlapping synthetic peptides covering the entire N protein sequence.\n Three immunodominant linear B-cell epitope regions were mapped to residues 166–180, 356–375, and 396–410 of the rN protein.\n When the reactivities of these peptides were screened with human sera from five SARS patients, peptides corresponding to residues 156–175 reacted strongly with sera from two of the SARS patients.\n These results indicated that the region around residues 156–175 of the N protein is immunogenic in the mouse, monkey, and human.\n We found that peptides corresponding to residues 1–30, 86–100, 306–320, and 351–365 contained murine immunodominant T-cell epitopes.\n To identify functional CTL epitopes of the N protein, BALB/c mice were immunized with peptides containing the H-2Kd CTL motif emulsified in adjuvant ISA-51/CpG.\n Using an IFN-? secretion cell assay and analysis by flow cytometry, peptides containing residues 81–95 were found to be capable of stimulating both CD4+ and CD8+ cell proliferation in vitro.\n We also only observed that peptides corresponding to residues 336–350 were capable of stimulating IFN-? production in T-cell cultures derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of macaques immunized with the rN protein emulsified in ISA/CpG adjuvant.\n Our current results together with those of others suggest that some immunodominant B-cell and T-cell epitopes are conserved in the mouse, monkey, and human.\n This information is very important for the development SARS diagnostic kits and a vaccine.\n","id":"PMC7115648","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shih-Jen","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chih-Hsiang","surname":"Leng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shu-pei","surname":"Lien","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hsiang-Yun","surname":"Chi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chiung-Yi","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chang-Ling","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei-Cheng","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chi-Ju","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shie-Liang","surname":"Hsieh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pele","surname":"Chong","email":"pelechong@nhri.org.tw","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.virol.2005.11.042","date":"2005-11-22","title":"SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid immunodominant T-cell epitope cluster is common to both exogenous recombinant and endogenous DNA-encoded immunogens","abstract":"Correspondence between the T-cell epitope responses of vaccine immunogens and those of pathogen antigens is critical to vaccine efficacy.\n In the present study, we analyzed the spectrum of immune responses of mice to three different forms of the SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid (N): (1) exogenous recombinant protein (N-GST) with Freund's adjuvant; (2) DNA encoding unmodified N as an endogenous cytoplasmic protein (pN); and (3) DNA encoding N as a LAMP-1 chimera targeted to the lysosomal MHC II compartment (p-LAMP-N).\n Lysosomal trafficking of the LAMP/N chimera in transfected cells was documented by both confocal and immunoelectron microscopy.\n The responses of the immunized mice differed markedly.\n The strongest T-cell IFN-?

up-regulated by real-time PCR analysis.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis differential gene expression profiling of PBMCs from patients with SARS strongly suggests that the response of SARS affected patients seems to be mainly an innate inflammatory response, rather than a specific immune response against a viral infection, as we observed a complete lack of cytokine genes usually triggered during a viral infection.\n\n Our study shows for the first time how the immune system responds to the SARS infection, and opens new possibilities for designing new diagnostics and treatments for this new

Chronic respiratory disease prevalence showed wide variability across GBD super-regions, with the highest prevalence among both males and females in high-income regions, and the lowest prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.\n\n The age-sex-specific prevalence of each chronic respiratory disease in 2017 was also highly variable geographically.\n\n Chronic respiratory diseases were the third leading cause of death in 2017 (7·0% [95% UI 6·8–7·2] of all deaths), behind cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms.\n\n Deaths due to chronic respiratory diseases numbered 3?914?196 (95% UI 3?790?578–4?044?819) in 2017, an increase of 18·0% since 1990, while total DALYs increased by 13·3%.\n\n However, when accounting for ageing and population growth, declines were observed in age-standardised prevalence (14·3% decrease), age-standardised death rates (42·6%), and age-standardised DALY rates (38·2%).\n\n In males and females, most chronic respiratory disease-attributable deaths and DALYs were due to COPD.\n\n In regional analyses, mortality rates from chronic respiratory diseases were greatest in south Asia and lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, also across both sexes.\n\n Notably, although absolute prevalence was lower in south Asia than in most other super-regions, YLLs due to chronic respiratory diseases across the subcontinent were the highest in the world.\n\n Death rates due to interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis were greater than those due to pneumoconiosis in all super-regions.\n\n Smoking was the leading risk factor for chronic respiratory disease-related disability across all regions for men.\n\n Among women, household air pollution from solid fuels was the predominant risk factor for chronic respiratory diseases in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, while ambient particulate matter represented the leading risk factor in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, and in the Middle East and north Africa super-region.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur study shows that chronic respiratory diseases remain a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with growth in absolute numbers but sharp declines in several age-standardised estimators since 1990. Premature mortality from chronic respiratory diseases seems to be highest in regions with less-resourced health systems on a per-capita basis.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates

making for health at the province level in China, which is home to a fifth of the global population, is of paramount importance.\n\n This analysis uses data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 to help inform decision making and monitor progress on health at the province level.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used the methods in GBD 2017 to analyse health patterns in the 34 province-level administrative units in China from 1990 to 2017. We estimated all-cause and cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), summary exposure values (SEVs), and attributable risk.\n\n We compared the observed results with expected values estimated based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI).\n\n\nFindings\nStroke and ischaemic heart disease were the leading causes of death and DALYs at the national level in China in 2017. Age-standardised DALYs per 100?000 population decreased by 33·1% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 29·8 to 37·4) for stroke and increased by 4·6% (–3·3 to 10·7) for ischaemic heart disease from 1990 to 2017. Age-standardised stroke, ischaemic heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and liver cancer were the five leading causes of YLLs in 2017. Musculoskeletal disorders, mental health disorders, and sense organ diseases were the three leading causes of YLDs in 2017, and high systolic blood pressure, smoking, high-sodium diet, and ambient particulate matter pollution were among the leading four risk factors contributing to deaths and DALYs.\n\n All provinces had higher than expected DALYs per 100?000 population for liver cancer, with the observed to expected ratio ranging from 2·04 to 6·88. The all-cause age-standardised DALYs per 100?000 population were lower than expected in all provinces in 2017, and among the top 20 level 3 causes were lower than expected for ischaemic heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, headache disorder, and low back pain.\n\n The largest percentage change at the national level in age-standardised SEVs among the top ten leading risk factors was in high body-mass index (185%, 95% UI 113·1 to 247·7]), followed by ambient particulate matter pollution (88·5%, 66·4 to 116·4).\n\n\nInterpretation\nChina has made substantial progress in reducing the burden of many diseases and disabilities.\n\n Strategies targeting chronic diseases, particularly in the elderly, should be prioritised in the expanding Chinese health-care system.\n\n\nFunding\nChina National Key Research and Development Program and Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6891889","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maigeng","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haidong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xinying","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wanqing","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaohong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lijun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Limin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yunning","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiangmei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jinlei","surname":"Qi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shicheng","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ashkan","surname":"Afshin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emmanuela","surname":"Gakidou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Scott","surname":"Glenn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Varsha Sarah","surname":"Krish","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Molly Katherine","surname":"Miller-Petrie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"W Cliff","surname":"Mountjoy-Venning","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erin C","surname":"Mullany","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Sofia Boston","surname":"Redford","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Hongyan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohsen","surname":"Naghavi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon I","surname":"Hay","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linhong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Christopher J L","surname":"Murray","email":"cjlm@uw.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaofeng","surname":"Liang","email":"liangxf@chinacdc.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.7189/jogh.07.020704","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in China in 1990 and 2010","abstract":"Background\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is set to become the third most frequent cause of death and also the third largest cause of global morbidity by 2020. In China, where the population is aging rapidly, COPD has become one of the leading causes of disability and a large economic burden.\n\n An epidemiological assessment of the COPD in China is required, with a focus on the number of cases living with disease, main determinants of the disease and time trends.\n\n\nMethods\nWe systematically searched large Chinese bibliographic databases and English databases to identify spirometry–based epidemiological studies of the prevalence of COPD in China diagnosed according to GOLD criteria.\n\n We estimated age– and gender–specific prevalence of COPD using a multilevel mixed–effect logistic regression.\n\n We also presented the time trends of COPD between 1990 and 2010 by age, gender and setting (urban vs rural).\n\n\nFindings\nIn 1990, the prevalence of COPD ranged from 0.49% (95% CI?=?0.29–0.85) in &lt;20 years group to 20.95% (95% CI?=?14.04–27.04) in&gt;?=?80 years group, and the crude prevalence for China was 2.70% (95% CI?=?1.86–3.51).\n\n In 2010, the prevalence in &lt;20 years was 0.55% (95% CI?=?0.37–1.04) and in&gt;?=?80 years was 22.89% (95% CI?=?18.13–28.96), with the crude prevalence for China of 3.84% (95% CI?=?3.30–4.77).\n\n The COPD prevalence in males was about two–fold higher than in females, and it increased with increasing age.\n\n Between 1990–2010, the total number of Chinese people living with COPD increased by 66.73%, from 30.90 million (95% CI?=?21.28–40.02) in 1990 to 51.52 million (95% CI?=?44.26–63.93) in 2010. This increase was most striking in middle age, and greater in females than in males from 30 years up to 64 years.\n\n Our estimates, which used an independent approach to acquiring data and development of analytical methods, and were based on a more complete data set, are remarkably similar to those produced recently by the GBD 2013 collaboration, differing by only about 5% in the estimated number of COPD cases in 1990 and by 1% in 2010.\nConclusions\nCOPD is a highly prevalent disease in China and its importance is growing steadily.\n\n The number of people living with COPD has increased substantially between 1990 and 2010. COPD is more frequent in males and in rural areas.\n\n Optimised primary and secondary prevention and treatment is urgently needed to counter this growing trend.\n\n Improved epidemiological studies will be required to assist development of more effective strategies of prevention and treatment of COPD in China in the next decade and beyond.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5785871","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kit Yee","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wanjing","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peige","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nuen Wing Katy","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Adrienne N","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weiyan","surname":"Jian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ireneous N","surname":"Soyiri","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Cousens","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Davies","surname":"Adeloye","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aziz","surname":"Sheikh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Harry","surname":"Campbell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Igor","surname":"Rudan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S2213-2600(18)30103-6","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in China: a nationwide prevalence study","abstract":"Background\nBecause of the rapid change in economic development and lifestyle in China, and the ageing population, concerns have grown that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) could become epidemic.\n\n An up-to-date nationwide estimation of COPD prevalence in China is needed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of individuals from mainland China aged 40 years or older.\n\n The primary outcome was COPD, defined according to the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) lung function criteria.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Dec 29, 2014, and Dec 31, 2015, 66?752 adults were recruited to the study population.\n\n The estimated standardised prevalence of COPD was 13·6% (95% CI 12·0–15·2).\n\n The prevalence of COPD differed significantly between men and women (19·0%, 95% CI 16·9–21·2 vs 8·1%, 6·8–9·3;

burden of 87 risk factors in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019","abstract":"Background\nRigorous analysis of levels and trends in exposure to leading risk factors and quantification of their effect on human health are important to identify where public health is making progress and in which cases current efforts are inadequate.\n\n The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 provides a standardised and comprehensive assessment of the magnitude of risk factor exposure, relative risk, and attributable burden of disease.\n\n\nMethods\nGBD 2019 estimated attributable mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 87 risk factors and combinations of risk factors, at the global level, regionally, and for 204 countries and territories.\n\n GBD uses a hierarchical list of risk factors so that specific risk factors (eg, sodium intake), and related aggregates (eg, diet quality), are both evaluated.\n\n This method has six analytical steps.\n\n (1) We included 560 risk–outcome pairs that met criteria for convincing or probable evidence on the basis of research studies.\n\n 12 risk–outcome pairs included in GBD 2017 no longer met inclusion criteria and 47 risk–outcome pairs for risks already included in GBD 2017 were added based on new evidence.\n\n (2) Relative risks were estimated as a function of exposure based on published systematic reviews, 81 systematic reviews done for GBD 2019, and meta-regression.\n\n (3) Levels of exposure in each age-sex-location-year included in the study were estimated based on all available data sources using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression method, or alternative methods.\n\n (4) We determined, from published trials or cohort studies, the level of exposure associated with minimum risk, called the theoretical minimum risk exposure level.\n\n (5) Attributable deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs were computed by multiplying population attributable fractions (PAFs) by the relevant outcome quantity for each age-sex-location-year.\n\n (6) PAFs and attributable burden for combinations of risk factors were estimated taking into account mediation of different risk factors through other risk factors.\n\n Across all six analytical steps, 30?652 distinct data sources were used in the analysis.\n\n Uncertainty in each step of the analysis was propagated into the final estimates of attributable burden.\n\n Exposure levels for dichotomous, polytomous, and continuous risk factors were summarised with use of the summary exposure value to facilitate comparisons over time, across location, and across risks.\n\n Because the entire time series from 1990 to 2019 has been re-estimated with use of consistent data and methods, these results supersede previously published GBD estimates of attributable burden.\n\n\nFindings\nThe largest declines in risk exposure from 2010 to 2019 were among a set of risks that are strongly linked to social and economic development, including household air pollution; unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing; and child growth failure.\n\n Global declines also occurred for tobacco smoking and lead exposure.\n\n The largest increases in risk exposure were for ambient particulate matter pollution, drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index.\n\n In 2019, the leading Level 2 risk factor globally for attributable deaths was high systolic blood pressure, which accounted for 10·8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 9·51–12·1) deaths (19·2% [16·9–21·3] of all deaths in 2019), followed by tobacco (smoked, second-hand, and chewing), which accounted for 8·71 million (8·12–9·31) deaths (15·4% [14·6–16·2] of all deaths in 2019).\n\n The leading Level 2 risk factor for attributable DALYs globally in 2019 was child and maternal malnutrition, which largely affects health in the youngest age groups and accounted for 295 million (253–350) DALYs (11·6% [10·3–13·1] of all global DALYs that year).\n\n The risk factor burden varied considerably in 2019 between age groups and locations.\n\n Among children aged 0–9 years, the three leading detailed risk factors for attributable DALYs were all related to malnutrition.\n\n Iron deficiency was the leading risk factor for those aged 10–24 years, alcohol use for those aged 25–49 years, and high systolic blood pressure for those aged 50–74 years and 75 years and older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOverall, the record for reducing exposure to harmful risks over the past three decades is poor.\n\n Success with reducing smoking and lead exposure through regulatory policy might point the way for a stronger role for public policy on other risks in addition to continued efforts to provide information on risk factor harm to the general public.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7566194","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Christopher J

territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019","abstract":"Background\nIn an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential.\n\n The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries.\n\n\nMethods\nGBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories.\n\n Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources.\n\n Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression.\n\n Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates.\n\n Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs.\n\n A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes.\n\n Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs.\n\n We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years.\n\n Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution.\n\n\nFindings\nGlobal health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates.\n\n After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable.\n\n Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990–2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0–9-year age group.\n\n Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth).\n\n In adolescents aged 10–24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth).\n\n Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10–24 years were also in the top ten in the 25–49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth).\n\n In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50–74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups.\n\n Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries.\n\n In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden.\n\n Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAs disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies.\n\n With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes.\n\n The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates

regional, and national age-sex specific mortality for 264 causes of death, 1980–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016","abstract":"Background\nMonitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death.\n\n The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year.\n\n YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age.\n\n We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality.\n\n To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year.\n\n Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best).\n\n We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex.\n\n We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI.\n\n Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016.\nFindings\nThe quality of available data varied by location.\n\n Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels.\n\n Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality.\n\n Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72·3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71·2–73·2) of deaths in 2016 with 19·3% (18·5–20·4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8·43% (8·00–8·67) from injuries.\n\n Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006–16—age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little.\n\n In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1·80 million deaths (95% UI 1·59 million to 1·89 million).\n\n Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176–181) increase in deaths in ages 90–94 years and a 210% (208–212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years.\n\n The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2·89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1·59%) during the same interval.\n\n Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.\n\n At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma.\n\n Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women.\n\n Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe.\n\n The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations.\n\n Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI.\n\n A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death.\n\n YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism.\n\n Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5605883","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Amanuel

the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been described, among which socioeconomic status including education is of particular interest.\n\n We studied the contribution of education to lung function and symptoms relative to smoking in a group of never-smokers with COPD compared to a group of long-time ex-smokers with COPD.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used baseline data of the COSYCONET cohort, including patients of GOLD grades 1–4 who were either never-smokers (n=150, age 68.5y, 53.3% female) or ex-smokers (?10 packyears) for at least 10 years (n=616, 68.3y, 29.9%

models.\n\n\nResults\nSpirometric lung function did not differ between groups, whereas CO diffusing capacity and indicators of lung hyperinflation/air-trapping showed better values in the never-smoker group.\n\n In both groups, spirometric lung function depended on the education level, with better values for higher education.\n\n Quality of life and 6-MWD were significantly different in never-smokers as well as patients with higher education.\n\n Asthma, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and bronchiectasis were more often reported in never-smokers, and asthma was more often reported in

Healthcare professionals and service providers are expected to collaboratively drive efforts to improve hospital readmission rates, which can be challenging due to the lack of clear consensus and guidelines on how best to predict and prevent readmissions.\n This review identifies these risk factors, highlighting the contribution of multimorbidity, frailty and poor socioeconomic status.\n Predictive models of readmission that address the multifactorial nature of readmissions and heterogeneity of the disease are reviewed, recognising that in an era of precision medicine, in-depth understanding of the intricate biological mechanisms that heighten the risk of COPD exacerbation and re-exacerbation is needed to derive modifiable biomarkers that can stratify accurately the highest risk groups for targeted treatment.\n We evaluate conventional and emerging strategies to reduce these potentially preventable readmissions.\n Here, early recognition of exacerbation symptoms and the delivery of prompt treatment can reduce risk of hospital admissions, while patient education can improve treatment adherence as a key component of self-management strategies.\n Care bundles are recommended to ensure high-quality care is provided consistently, but evidence for their benefit is limited to date.\n The search continues for interventions which are effective, sustainable and applicable to a diverse population of patients with COPD exacerbations.\n Further research into mechanisms that drive exacerbation and affect recovery is crucial to improve our understanding of this complex, highly prevalent disease and to advance the development of more effective treatments.\n","id":"PMC7211949","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chia

estimated from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 using DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool.\n\n The estimated annual percentage change of the age standardised mortality rate was calculated using a generalised linear model with a Gaussian distribution.\n\n Mortality and DALYs were stratified according to the Socio-demographic index.\n\n The strength and direction of the association between the Socio-demographic index and mortality rate were measured using the Spearman rank order correlation.\n\n Risk factors for chronic respiratory diseases were analysed from exposure data.\n\n\nResults\nBetween 1990 and 2017, the total number of deaths due to chronic respiratorydiseases increased by 18.0%, from 3.32 (95% uncertainty interval 3.01 to 3.43) million in 1990 to 3.91 (3.79 to 4.04) million in 2017. The age standardised mortality rate of chronic respiratory diseases decreased by an average of 2.41% (2.28% to 2.55%) annually.\n\n During the 27 years, the annual decline in mortality rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 2.36%, uncertainty interval 2.21% to 2.50%) and pneumoconiosis (2.56%, 2.44% to 2.68%) has been slow, whereas the mortality rate for interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis (0.97%, 0.92% to 1.03%) has increased.\n\n Reductions in DALYs for asthma and pneumoconiosis have been seen, but DALYs due to COPD, and interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis have increased.\n\n Mortality and the annual change in mortality rate due to chronic respiratory diseases varied considerably across 195 countries.\n\n Assessment of the factors responsible for regional variations in mortality and DALYs and the unequal distribution of improvements during the 27 years showed negative correlations between the Socio-demographic index and the mortality rates of COPD, pneumoconiosis, and asthma.\n\n Regions with a low Socio-demographic index had the highest mortality and DALYs.\n\n Smoking remained the major risk factor for mortality due to COPD and asthma.\n\n Pollution from particulate matter was the major contributor to deaths from COPD in regions with a low Socio-demographic index.\n\n Since 2013, a high body mass index has become the principal risk factor for asthma.\n\n\nConclusions\nRegions with a low Socio-demographic index had the greatest burden of disease.\n\n The estimated contribution of risk factors (such as smoking,

nicotine, oxidants, fine particulate matter, and aldehydes.\n These components were considered to be the principle factor driving the pathogenesis and progression of pulmonary disease.\n A large proportion of lung cancer patients showed a history of COPD, which demonstrated that there might be a close relationship between COPD and lung cancer.\n In the early stages of smoking, lung barrier provoked protective response and DNA repair are likely to suppress these changes to a certain extent.\n In the presence of long-term smoking exposure, these mechanisms seem to be malfunctioned and lead to disease progression.\n The infiltration of inflammatory cells to mucosa, submucosa, and glandular tissue caused by inhaled cigarette smoke is responsible for the destruction of matrix, blood supply shortage, and epithelial cell death.\n Conversely, cancer cells have the capacity to modulate the proliferation of epithelial cells and produce of new vascular networks.\n Comprehension

In addition, the age-standardized DALY and death rates attributable to each risk factor except household air pollution and low temperature were the highest in the low-middle-SDI region.\n\n In 2019, the COPD burden attributable to smoking ambient particulate matter, ozone, occupational particles, low and high temperature was obviously greater in males than in females.\n\n Meanwhile, the most important risk factors for female varied across regions (low- and low-middle-SDI regions: household air pollution; middle-SDI region: ambient particles; high-middle- and high-SDI region: smoking).\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Increasing trends of COPD burden attributable to ambient particulate matter, ozone, and high temperature exposure in the low-middle- and low-SDI regions call for an urgent need to implement specific and effective measures.\n\n Moreover, considering the gender differences in COPD burdens attributable to some risk factors such as ambient particulate matter and ozone with similar SEV, further research on biological differences between sexes in COPD and relevant policy-making of disease prevention are required.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online

expectancy across China and its provinces, 1990–2017: an analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017","abstract":"Background\nAir pollution is an important public health concern in China, with high levels of exposure to both ambient and household air pollution.\n\n To inform action at provincial levels in China, we estimated the exposure to air pollution and its effect on deaths, disease burden, and loss of life expectancy across all provinces in China from 1990 to 2017.\nMethods\nIn all 33 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and special administrative regions in China, we estimated exposure to air pollution, including ambient particulate matter pollution (defined as the annual gridded concentration of PM2·5), household air pollution (defined as the percentage of households using solid cooking fuels and the corresponding exposure to PM2·5), and ozone pollution (defined as average gridded ozone concentrations).\n\n We used the methods of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 to estimate deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to air pollution, and what the life expectancy would have been if air pollution levels had been less than the minimum level causing health loss.\n\n\nFindings\nThe average annual population-weighted PM2·5 exposure in China was 52·7 ?g/m3 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 41·0–62·8) in 2017, which is 9% lower than in 1990 (57·8 ?g/m3, 45·0–67·0).\n\n We estimated that 1·24 million (95% UI 1·08–1·40) deaths in China were attributable to air pollution in 2017, including 851?660 (712?002–990?271) from ambient PM2·5 pollution, 271?089 (209?882–346?561) from household air pollution from solid fuels, and 178?187 (67?650–286?229) from ambient ozone pollution.\n\n The age-standardised DALY rate attributable to air pollution was 1513·1 per 100?000 in China in 2017, and was higher in males (1839·8 per 100?000) than in females (1198·3 per 100?000).\n\n The age-standardised death rate attributable to air pollution decreased by 60·6% (55·7–63·7) for China overall between 1990 and 2017, driven by an 85·4% (83·2–87·3) decline in household air pollution and a 12·0% (1·4–22·1) decline in ambient PM2·5 pollution.\n\n 40·0% of DALYs for COPD were attributable to air pollution, as were 35·6% of DALYs for lower respiratory infections, 26·1% for diabetes, 25·8% for lung cancer, 19·5% for ischaemic heart disease, and 12·8% for stroke.\n\n We estimated that if the air pollution level in China was below the minimum causing health loss, the average life expectancy would have been 1·25 years greater.\n\n The DALY rate per 100?000 attributable to air pollution varied across provinces, ranging from 482·3 (371·1–604·1) in Hong Kong to 1725·6 (720·4–2653·1) in Xinjiang for ambient pollution, and from 18·7 (9·1–34·0) in Shanghai to 1804·5 (1339·5–2270·1) in Tibet for household pollution.\n\n Although the overall mortality attributable to air pollution decreased in China between 1990 and 2017, 12 provinces showed an increasing trend during the past 27 years.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPollution from ambient PM2·5 and household burning of solid fuels decreased markedly in recent years in China, after extensive efforts to control emissions.\n\n However, PM2·5 concentrations still exceed the WHO Air Quality Guideline for the entire population of China, with 81% living in regions exceeding the WHO Interim Target 1, and air pollution remains an important risk factor.\n\n Sustainable development policies should be implemented and enforced to reduce the impact of air pollution on long-term economic development and population health.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation; and China National Key Research and

of COPD in China and to determine the risk factors of the disease.\n The number of studies included in the review was 47 with an average quality assessment score of 7.70 out of 10. Reported COPD prevalence varied between 1.20% and 8.87% in different provinces/cities across China.\n The prevalence rate of COPD was higher among men (7.76%) than women (4.07%).\n The disease was more prevalent in rural areas (7.62%) than in urban areas (6.09%).\n The diagnostic rate of COPD patients in China varied from 23.61% to 30.00%.\n The percentage of COPD patients receiving outpatient treatment was around 50%, while the admission rate ranged between 8.78% and 35.60%.\n Tobacco exposure and biomass fuel/solid fuel usage were documented as two important risk factors of COPD.\n COPD ranked among the top three leading causes of death in China.\n The direct medical cost of COPD ranged from 72 to 3,565 USD per capita per year, accounting for 33.33% to 118.09% of local average annual income.\n The most commonly used scales for the assessment of quality of life (QoL) included Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire, Airways Questionnaire 20, SF-36, and their revised versions.\n The status of QoL was worse among COPD patients than in non-COPD patients, and COPD patients were at higher risks of depression.\n The COPD burden in China was high in terms of economic burden and QoL.\n In view of the high smoking rate and considerable concerns related to air pollution and smog in China, countermeasures need to be taken to improve disease prevention and management to reduce disease burdens raised by COPD.\n","id":"PMC5927339","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Bifan","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yanfang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Ming","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luying","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148819","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Global

insulin resistance, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\n Though there is some variation in the definition by other health care organization, the differences are minor.\n With the successful conquest of communicable infectious diseases in most of the world, this new non-communicable disease (NCD) has become the major health hazard of modern world.\n Though it started in the Western world, with the spread of the Western lifestyle across the globe, it has become now a truly global problem.\n The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is often more in the urban population of some developing countries than in its Western counterparts.\n The two basic forces spreading this malady are the increase in consumption of high calorie-low fiber fast food and the decrease in physical activity due to mechanized transportations and sedentary form of leisure time activities.\n The syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like type 2 diabetes, coronary diseases, stroke, and other disabilities.\n The total cost of the malady including the cost of health care and loss of potential economic activity is in trillions.\n The present trend is not sustainable unless a magic cure is found (unlikely) or concerted global/governmental/societal efforts are made to change the lifestyle that is promoting it.\n There are certainly some elements in the causation of the metabolic syndrome that cannot be changed but many are amenable for corrections and curtailments.\n For example, better urban planning to encourage active lifestyle, subsidizing consumption of whole grains and possible taxing high calorie snacks, restricting media advertisement of unhealthy food, etc.\n Revitalizing old fashion healthier lifestyle, promoting old-fashioned foods using healthy herbs rather than oil and sugar, and educating people about choosing healthy/wholesome food over junks are among the steps that can be considered.\n","id":"PMC5866840","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mohammad

hypertension.\n\n Early identification of MetS is important for preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\n MetS has not been systematically explored in Greek primary care.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo examine MetS frequency among primary care patients 40?years of age or older in Crete.\n\n\nMethods\nA descriptive study was conducted (July–December 2015).\n\n General practitioners, randomly selected from regional physician listings, recruited consecutive patients, 40?years of age or older, visiting their practice.\n\n Chart audits were completed for eligible patients using medical records, including demographics and cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus).\n\n MetS was defined using the revised NCEP ATP III criteria.\n\n Frequencies with 95% confidence intervals were calculated.\n\n Gender differences were explored using Chi-square and Mann–Whitney tests.\n\n\nResults\nOur sample consisted of 815 patients (55.7% female; mean age

in carotenoids as potent micronutrient antioxidants in the treatment of NAFLD.\n In addition to their antioxidative function, carotenoids regulate macrophage/Kupffer cell polarization and thereby

fat was quantified by two observers based on the relative signal loss on T2-weighted fast spin-echo MR images with fat saturation compared to images without fat saturation.\n The prevalence of NAFLD/liver steatosis, defined as a measured intrahepatic fat content of at least 5%, was significantly higher in underweight IBD patients than in normal weight patients (87.6% versus 21.5%, p&lt;0.001).\n Compared to the cases, the liver fat content of the controls was reduced by -0.19 units on average (-19%; 95%Cl: -0.20; -0.14).\n Similar results were obtained for the subgroup of non-IBD individuals (n = 12; -0.25 units on average (-25%); 95%Cl: -0.35; -0.14).\n Patients with extremely low body weight (BMI &lt;17.5 kg/m2) showed the highest liver fat content (+0.15 units on average (+15%) compared to underweight patients with a BMI of 17.5–18.5 kg/m2 (p&lt;0.05)).\n Furthermore, underweight patients showed slightly increased liver enzymes and liver diameters.\n There were no indications of significant differences in disease duration, type of medications or surgery between cases and controls and also, there were no significant differences between observers or field strengths (p&gt;0.05).\n The prevalence of liver steatosis was higher among underweight IBD and non-IBD patients compared to normal weight controls.\n Also, underweight patients showed slightly increased liver enzymes and liver diameters, hinting at initial metabolic disturbances.\n","id":"PMC6241122","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lisa

Hepatitis B Virus Infection in Bangladesh: Prevalence among General Population, Risk Groups and Genotype Distribution","abstract":"Despite a considerable body of published research on hepatitis B in Bangladesh, researchers continue to lament the lack of reliable information about hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection epidemiology.\n The present review aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the literature with particular focus on a number of epidemiological questions, as well as a commentary on the trends of hepatitis B research as it has taken place in Bangladesh.\n The key themes to emerge from this review are: first, beyond noting a declining trend, it is difficult to provide conclusive estimates about HBV prevalence in the general population of Bangladesh.\n The majority of the studies, even the ones conducted on apparently healthy populations, fail to be adequately representative for the reasons explored in the article.\n Secondly, HBV infection in Bangladesh is sharply stratified across sociodemographic lines, which speaks to the role of awareness and risk exposure in HBV prevalence.\n Third, more research on occult infection rates is required to estimate the extent of risk posed by the current blood donation screening program, which relies exclusively on hepatitis B surface antigen as a biomarker.\n The same considerations apply for the comparative importance of vertical versus horizontal transmission and prevalence among particular risk groups like healthcare workers with high occupational exposure.\n Finally, while recent studies do allow us, albeit with some ambiguity, to draw conclusions about distribution of HBV genotypes in Bangladesh, there needs to be an added emphasis on molecular epidemiology.\n It is hoped that the present review, the first of its kind in Bangladesh, will serve as an up-to-date summary of the course HBV epidemiology research in Bangladesh has taken thus far, as well as crucial gaps to address going forward.\n","id":"PMC6265756","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Md.

epidemiology of the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), particularly in rural areas in Asia, we undertook such a study among the population of a rural community in Bangladesh with the aims to (1) determine the prevalence of non-obese and obese NAFLD, (2) compare the sociodemographic clinical and metabolic characteristics between non-obese and obese NAFLD subjects, and (3) determine the risk factors of NAFLD and no-nobese NAFLD.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this door-to-door survey, clinical examination, anthropometric measurements, biochemical tests and ultrasonography were performed on the adult population (?18 years) of three villages in Bangladesh.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1682, 1353 (80.44%) responded.\n\n After the exclusion of 48 subjects for alcohol consumption, HBsAg or anti-hepatitis C virus positivity, 1305 ((mean age 41.28±15.10 years, female 908 (69.6%)) were included in the final analysis.\n\n On ultrasonography, among the study population, 57 (4.4%) non-obese, 185 (14.2%) obese and, overall, 242 (18.5 %, (male 23.40%, female 16.4%, p=0. 003)) participants had NAFLD.\n\n NAFLD was detected in 57/804 (7.1%) of non-obese and 185/501 (36.93%) obese participants.\n\n Among the lean subjects, 24/592 (4.1%) had NAFLD.\n\n Among NAFLD subjects, 57 (23.55%) were non-obese, and 53 (22%) had raised alanine aminotransferase.\n\n On multivariate analysis, age &gt;40 years, male gender, metabolic syndrome (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity were found as the risk factors for NAFLD.\n\n There were no differences in sociodemographic characteristics, DM, MS, abdominal obesity, hypertension and dyslipidaemia between non-obese and obese NAFLD (all p&gt;0.05).\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this community study in Bangladesh, NAFLD was present in 18.5% participants, one-quarter of whom were non-obese.\n\n Apart from body mass index, the metabolic profile was comparable between obese and non-obese NAFLD.\n\n Public health

utilization of glucose.\n In later stages, they stimulate hepatocyte apoptosis and fibrosis.\n In rodents, blocking ceramide synthesis ameliorates all stages of NAFLD.\n In humans, serum and liver

simply depots for energy storage, LDs are increasingly recognized to impact a wide range of biological processes that influence cellular metabolism, signaling, and function.\n\n While progress has been made toward understanding the factors leading to LD accumulation (i.\n\ne.\n\n steatosis) and its progression to advanced stages of NAFLD and/or systemic metabolic dysfunction, much remains to be resolved.\n\n\nScope of review\nThis review covers many facets of LD biology.\n\n We provide a brief overview of the major pathways of lipid accretion and degradation that contribute to steatosis and how they are altered in NAFLD.\n\n The major focus is on the relationship between LDs and cell function and the detailed mechanisms that couple or uncouple steatosis from the severity and progression of NAFLD and systemic comorbidities.\n\n The importance of specific lipids and proteins within or on LDs as key components that determine whether LD accumulation is linked to cellular and metabolic dysfunction is presented.\n\n We discuss emerging areas of LD biology and future research directions that are needed to advance our understanding of the role of LDs in NAFLD etiology.\n\n\nMajor conclusions\nImpairments in LD breakdown appear to contribute to disease progression, but inefficient incorporation of fatty acids (FAs) into LD-containing triacylglycerol (TAG) and the consequential changes in FA partitioning also affect NAFLD etiology.\n\n Increased LD abundance in hepatocytes does not necessarily equate to cellular dysfunction.\n\n While LD accumulation is the prerequisite step for most NAFLD cases, the protein and lipid composition of LDs are critical factors in determining the progression from simple steatosis.\n\n Further defining the detailed molecular mechanisms linking LDs to metabolic dysfunction is important for designing effective therapeutic approaches targeting NAFLD and its comorbidities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8324678","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Douglas

lipotoxicity in NAFLD pathogenesis: is CD36 a key driver?","abstract":"id='Par1'>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide.\n NAFLD stages range from simple steatosis (NAFL) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.\n One of the crucial events clearly involved in NAFLD progression is the lipotoxicity resulting from an excessive fatty acid (FFA) influx to hepatocytes.\n Hepatic lipotoxicity occurs when the capacity of the hepatocyte to manage and export FFAs as triglycerides (TGs) is overwhelmed.\n This review provides succinct insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for lipotoxicity in NAFLD, including ER and oxidative stress, autophagy, lipoapotosis and inflammation.\n In addition, we highlight the role of CD36/FAT fatty acid translocase in NAFLD pathogenesis.\n Up-to-date, it is well known that CD36 increases FFA uptake and, in the liver, it drives hepatosteatosis onset and might contribute to its progression to NASH.\n Clinical studies have reinforced the significance of CD36 by showing increased content in the liver of NAFLD patients.\n Interestingly, circulating levels of a soluble form of CD36 (sCD36) are abnormally elevated in NAFLD patients and positively correlate with the histological grade of hepatic steatosis.\n In fact, the induction of CD36 translocation to the plasma membrane of the hepatocytes may be a determining factor in the physiopathology of hepatic steatosis in NAFLD patients.\n Given all these data, targeting the fatty acid translocase CD36 or some of its functional regulators may be a promising therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.\n","id":"PMC7519685","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Patricia","surname":"Rada","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Águeda","surname":"González-Rodríguez","email":"aguedagr.phd@gmail.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Águeda","surname":"González-Rodríguez","email":"aguedagr.phd@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carmelo","surname":"García-Monzón","email":"cgarciamonzon@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ángela

Triglycerides; cholesterol; FFA; glucose and insulin were measured every 2 h with the determination of fatty acid composition of FFA.\n Results: higher serum FFA levels in NAFLD subjects are mainly due to levels of oleic, palmitic and linoleic acids at different times.\n Significant increases were shown for docosahexaenoic acid, linolenic acid, eicosatrienoic acid, and arachidonic acid, although this was just on one occasion.\n In the postprandial phase, homeostatic model assessment HOMA index positively correlated with the ?3/?6 ratio in NAFLD patients.\n Conclusions: the higher serum levels of FFA in NAFLD subjects are mainly due to levels of oleic and palmitic acids which are the most abundant circulating free fatty acids.\n This is almost exactly corresponded with significant increases in linoleic acid.\n An imbalance in the n-3/n-6 fatty acids ratio could modulate postprandial responses with more pronounced effects in insulin-resistant subjects, such as NAFLD

for liver disease outcome and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n Despite different mechanism of primary liver injury and disease-specific cell responses, the progression of fibrotic liver disease follows shared patterns across the main liver disease etiologies.\n Scientific discoveries within the last decade have transformed the understanding of the mechanisms of liver fibrosis.\n Removal or elimination of the causative agent such as control or cure of viral infection has shown that liver fibrosis is reversible.\n However, reversal often occurs too slowly or too infrequent to avoid life-threatening complications particularly in advanced fibrosis.\n Thus, there is a huge unmet medical need for anti-fibrotic therapies to prevent liver disease progression and HCC development.\n However, while many anti-fibrotic candidate agents have shown robust effects in experimental animal models, their anti-fibrotic effects in clinical trials have been limited or absent.\n Thus, no approved therapy exists for liver fibrosis.\n In this review we summarize cellular drivers and molecular mechanisms of fibrogenesis in chronic liver diseases and discuss their impact for the development of urgently needed anti-fibrotic

induction of genes involved in cholesterol transport and efflux.\n In the context of diabetes, regression of atherosclerosis is impaired.\n We proposed that changes in glucose levels modulate LXR-dependent gene expression.\n Using a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) and primary bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) cultured in normal or diabetes relevant high glucose conditions we found that high glucose inhibits the LXR-dependent expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), but not ABCG1. To probe for this mechanism, we surveyed the expression of a host of chromatin-modifying enzymes and found that Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2) was reduced in high compared to normal glucose conditions.\n Importantly, ABCA1 expression and ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux were reduced in Prmt2\n-/- compared to wild type BMDMs.\n Monocytes from diabetic mice also showed decreased expression of Prmt2 compared to non-diabetic counterparts.\n Thus, PRMT2 represents a glucose-sensitive factor that plays a role in LXR-mediated ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux and lends insight to the presence of increased atherosclerosis in diabetic patients.\n","id":"PMC4545936","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maryem

manifestations, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n Nuclear receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors with a multifaceted role in controlling many metabolic activities, such as regulation of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and modulation of inflammatory genes.\n The activity of nuclear receptors is key in maintaining metabolic flexibility.\n Their activity depends on the availability of endogenous ligands, like fatty acids or oxysterols, and their derivatives produced by the catabolic action of metabolic lipases, most of which are under the control of nuclear receptors.\n For example, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is activated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?) and conversely releases fatty acids as ligands for PPAR?, therefore, demonstrating the interdependency of nuclear receptors and lipases.\n The diverse biological functions and importance of nuclear receptors in metabolic syndrome and NAFLD has led to substantial effort to target them therapeutically.\n This review summarizes recent findings on the roles of lipases and selected nuclear receptors, PPARs, and liver X receptor (LXR) in obesity, diabetes, and NAFLD.\n","id":"PMC8145571","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emmanuel D.","surname":"Dixon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexander D.","surname":"Nardo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Alexander D.","surname":"Nardo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thierry","surname":"Claudel","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Thierry","surname":"Claudel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Trauner","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Trauner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marek","surname":"Skrzypski","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Marek","surname":"Skrzypski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marek","surname":"Skrzypski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/gad.850400","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Role of LXRs in control of lipogenesis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1872-034X.2008.00382.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Liver X receptor in cooperation with SREBP-1c is a major lipid synthesis regulator in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1074/jbc.M605023200","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The liver X receptor (LXR) and hepatic lipogenesis.

Previous rodent studies have indicated that these conditions may be triggered by the accumulation of the sphingolipid ceramide in insulin-sensitive tissues.\n\n However, data are lacking in this regard from both humans and non-human primates.\n\n\nObjective:\nHere we have investigated the relationship between plasma ceramides and metabolic syndrome in Rhesus macaques fed a high-fat and high-fructose (HFFD) ‘western' diet.\n\n\nMethods:\nWe investigated this relationship in cohorts of monkeys fed a HFFD for a period of 8 months to 5 years.\n\n Animals were classified as control, pre-diabetic or diabetic based on fasting plasma parameters and insulin sensitivity.\n\n\nResults:\nHFFD treatment produced significant increases in body weight and body fat and also resulted in a decline in insulin sensitivity.\n\n In parallel to the reduction in insulin sensitivity, significant increases in both plasma ceramide and dihydroceramide levels were observed, which further increased as animals progressed to the diabetic state.\n\n Plasma levels of the rare sphingolipid C18:0 deoxysphinganine, a marker of increased metabolic flux through serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), were also elevated in both pre- and diabetic animals.\n\n Furthermore, plasma serine levels were significantly elevated in diabetic monkeys, which may indicate a shift in SPT substrate selectivity from serine to alanine or glycine.\n\n In contrast, branch chain amino acids were unchanged in pre-diabetic non-human primates, and only plasma valine levels were elevated in diabetic animals.\n\n\nConclusion:\nTogether, these data indicate that HFFD induces de novo synthesis of ceramides in non-human primates, and that increased production of plasma ceramides is significantly correlated with the decline in insulin sensitivity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3718866","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"J

acting to meet specific physiologic requirements.\n The alveoli are the niche of the most active lipid metabolic cell in the lung, the type 2 cell (T2C).\n T2C synthesize surfactant lipids that are an absolute requirement for respiration, including dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine.\n After its synthesis and secretion into the alveoli, surfactant is recycled by the T2C or degraded by the alveolar macrophages (AM).\n Surfactant biosynthesis and recycling is tightly regulated, and dysregulation of this pathway occurs in many pulmonary disease processes.\n Alveolar lipids can participate in the development of pulmonary disease from their extracellular location in the lumen of the alveoli, and from their intracellular location in T2C or AM.\n External insults like smoke and pollution can disturb surfactant homeostasis and result in either surfactant insufficiency or accumulation.\n But disruption of surfactant homeostasis is also observed in many chronic adult diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and others.\n Sustained damage to the T2C is one of the postulated causes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and surfactant homeostasis is disrupted during fibrotic conditions.\n Similarly, surfactant homeostasis is impacted during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and infections.\n Bioactive lipids like eicosanoids and sphingolipids also

phospholipids, which have not been studied in pulmonary surfactant.\n Availability of phospholipid, cholesterol, and sphingomyelin in BAL strongly correlated with pulmonary function and this was attributable to specific lipid species of phosphatidylcholine with surface tension reducing properties, and of phosphatidylglycerol with antimicrobial roles, as well as to other less studied lipid species.\n Mice exposed to smoke for six months recapitulated surfactant lipidomic changes observed in human subjects with COPD.\n In summary, we show that the surfactant lipidome is substantially

examined mortality using a consensus definition and a weight-loss definition of cachexia among COPD cases and compared two new COPD severity indices with BODE.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>In the current report, the consensus definition for cachexia incorporated weight-loss &gt;?5% in 12-months or low BMI in addition to 3/5 of decreased muscle strength, fatigue, anorexia, low FFMI and

aged 40–59 years with no history of cardiovascular disease (CHD or stroke) or diabetes drawn from general practices in 24 British towns and followed up for 20 years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 680 major

and circulating microparticles (cMPs) released by CS.\n CS exposure was sufficient to increase microparticle levels in plasma of humans and mice, and in supernatants of primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells.\n CS-released EMPs contained predominantly exosomes that were significantly enriched in let-7d, miR-191; miR-126; and miR125a, microRNAs that reciprocally decreased intracellular in CS-exposed endothelium.\n CS-released EMPs and cMPs were ceramide-rich and required the ceramide-synthesis enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) for their release, an enzyme which was found to exhibit significantly higher activity in plasma of COPD patients or of CS-exposed mice.\n The ex vivo or in vivo engulfment of EMPs or cMPs by peripheral blood monocytes-derived macrophages was associated with significant inhibition of efferocytosis.\n Our results indicate that CS, via aSMase, releases circulating EMPs with distinct microRNA cargo and that EMPs affect the clearance of

endothelium cell activation or apoptosis.\n EMPs possess both physiological and pathological effects and may promote oxidative stress and vascular inflammation.\n EMPs release is triggered by inducer

Atheroemboli, resulting from ruptured carotid plaques, is a major cause of stroke.\n Increasing evidence suggests that EMPs play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, acting as a marker of damage, either exacerbating disease progression or triggering a repair response.\n In this regard, it has been suggested that EMPs have the potential to act as biomarkers of disease

straight part of arteries but a cobblestone shape near the pro-atherogenic region such as branch bifurcation.\n Although the effects of hemodynamic forces on ECs have been widely studied, it is not clear whether the EC morphology affects its own function and thus the inflammatory response of monocytes.\n Here we showed that elongated ECs cultured on poly-(dimethyl siloxane) membrane surface with microgrooves significantly suppressed the activation of the monocytes in co-culture, in comparison to ECs with a cobblestone shape.\n The transfer of EC-conditioned medium to monocytes had the same effect, suggesting that soluble factors were involved in EC–monocyte communication.\n Further investigation demonstrated that elongated ECs upregulated the expression of anti-inflammatory microRNAs, especially miR-10a.\n Moreover, miR-10a was found in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by ECs and transferred to monocytes, and the inhibition of EV secretion from ECs repressed the upregulation of miR-10a.\n Consistently, the inhibition of miR-10a expression in ECs reduced their anti-inflammatory effect on monocytes.\n These results reveal that the EC morphology can regulate inflammatory response through EVs, which provides a basis for the design and the optimization of biomaterials for vascular tissue

associated with cardiometabolic comorbidities and systemic inflammation.\n\n Although several factors are associated with NAFLD, the influence of sarcopenia on NAFLD has not been fully determined in patients with COPD.\n\n We explored whether sarcopenia is associated with NAFLD in a COPD population.\n\n\nMethods\nData from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2008–2011 were analyzed.\n\n The subjects were defined as having NAFLD when they had a hepatic steatosis index (HSI) score &gt;36, which is a previously validated NAFLD prediction score.\n\n Sarcopenia_BMI (=total appendicular skeletal muscle mass [kg]/body mass index [kg/m2]), sarcopenia_BW (=total appendicular skeletal muscle mass [kg]/body weight [kg] × 100), and sarcopenia_height (= total appendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg)/height2 (m)) measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to diagnose sarcopenia.\n\n\nResults\nNAFLD was identified in 124 (14.6%) of 850 COPD subjects using the HSI.\n\n Multivariable logistic analyses adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), forced vital capacity (FVC), and metabolic syndrome demonstrated that sarcopenia (sarcopenia_BMI, odds ratio [OR] = 1.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11–3.46, p = 0.022; sarcopenia_BW, OR = 2.25; 95% CI, 1.30–3.92, p = 0.004) was associated with NAFLD in patients with COPD.\n\n The proportion of sarcopenia_BMI was higher in patients with a high fibrotic burden from NAFLD (Q3, Q4) than in subjects with a low fibrotic burden from NALFD (Q1, Q2) (54.8% vs 24.2%, p = 0.024).\n\n The proportion of sarcopenia_BW was also higher in patients with a high fibrotic burden from NAFLD than in patients with a low fibrotic burden from NAFLD (51.6% vs 30.6%, p = 0.029).\n\n\nConclusion\nSarcopenia was associated with an increased risk for NAFLD in patients with COPD, independent of age, sex, lung function, and metabolic factors.\n\n Sarcopenic COPD was also

nutritional and clinical implications – a review","abstract":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors are expressed in many tissues, including adipocytes, hepatocytes, muscles and endothelial cells; however, the affinity depends on the isoform of PPAR, and different distribution and expression profiles, which ultimately lead to different clinical outcomes.\n Because they play an important role in lipid and glucose homeostasis, they are called lipid and insulin sensors.\n Their actions are limited to specific tissue types and thus, reveal a characteristic influence on target cells.\n PPAR? mainly influences fatty acid metabolism and its activation lowers lipid levels, while PPAR? is mostly involved in the regulation of the adipogenesis, energy balance, and lipid biosynthesis.\n PPAR?/? participates in fatty acid oxidation, mostly in skeletal and cardiac muscles, but it also regulates blood glucose and cholesterol levels.\n Many natural and synthetic ligands influence the expression of these receptors.\n Synthetic ligands are widely used in the treatment of dyslipidemia (e.\ng.\n fibrates - PPAR? activators) or in diabetes mellitus (e.\ng.\n thiazolidinediones - PPAR? agonists).\n New generation drugs - PPAR?/? dual agonists - reveal hypolipemic, hypotensive, antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant action while the overexpression of PPAR?/? prevents the development of obesity and reduces lipid accumulation in cardiac cells, even during a high-fat diet.\n Precise data on the expression and function of natural PPAR agonists on glucose and lipid metabolism are still missing, mostly because the same ligand influences several receptors and a number of reports have provided conflicting results.\n To date, we know that PPARs have the capability to accommodate and bind a variety of natural and synthetic lipophilic acids, such as essential fatty acids, eicosanoids, phytanic acid and palmitoylethanolamide.\n A current understanding of the effects of PPARs, their molecular mechanisms and the role of these receptors in nutrition and therapeutic treatment are delineated in this

expression and deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins fibronectin, type I collagen, tenascin and perlecan were measured using qPCR or ECM ELISA, respectively.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Challenge with the ?-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA), but not ?-3 PUFAs or SFAs, resulted in increased IL-6 and CXCL8 release from fibroblasts, however IL-6 and CXCL8 release was reduced in COPD (n?=?19) compared to non-COPD (n?=?36).\n\n AA-induced cytokine release was partially mediated by downstream mediators of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in both COPD and non-COPD.\n\n In comparison, TNF?-induced IL-6 and CXCL8 release was similar in COPD and non-COPD, indicating a specific interaction of AA in COPD.\n\n In patients with or without COPD, regression analysis revealed no relationship between BMI and cytokine release.\n\n In addition, AA, but not SFAs or ?-3 PUFAs reduced the basal deposition of fibronectin, type I collagen, tenascin and perlecan into the ECM in COPD fibroblasts.\n\n In non-COPD fibroblasts, AA-challenge decreased basal deposition of type I collagen and perlecan, but not fibronectin and tenascin.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>This study shows that AA has disease-specific effects on inflammation and ECM protein deposition.\n\n The impaired response to AA in COPD might in part explain why obesity appears to have less detrimental effects in COPD, compared to other lung diseases.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12931-018-0919-4)

lipoxygenases (LOXs) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes to a spectrum of bioactive mediators that includes prostanoids, leukotrienes (LTs), epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic

cancers, and inflammatory diseases.\n This review sets out to summarize the physiological and pathophysiological importance of the AA metabolizing pathways and outline the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of AA related to its three main metabolic pathways in CVD and cancer progression will provide valuable insight for developing new therapeutic drugs for CVD and anti-cancer

to contribute to COPD risk and disease progression.\n Therefore we developed a systematic approach to identify key regulators of COPD that integrates genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression, and phenotype data in lung tissue from COPD and control samples.\n Our integrative analysis identified 126 key regulators of COPD.\n We identified EPAS1 as the only key regulator whose downstream genes significantly overlapped with multiple genes sets associated with COPD disease severity.\n EPAS1 is distinct in comparison with other key regulators in terms of methylation profile and downstream target genes.\n Genes predicted to be regulated by EPAS1 were enriched for biological processes including signaling, cell communications, and system development.\n We confirmed that EPAS1 protein levels are lower in human COPD lung tissue compared to non-disease controls and that Epas1 gene expression is reduced in mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke.\n As EPAS1 downstream genes were significantly enriched for hypoxia responsive genes in endothelial cells, we tested EPAS1 function in human endothelial cells.\n EPAS1 knockdown by siRNA in endothelial cells impacted genes that significantly overlapped with EPAS1 downstream genes in lung tissue including hypoxia responsive genes, and genes associated with emphysema severity.\n Our first integrative analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles illustrates that not only does DNA methylation play a ‘causal’ role in the molecular pathophysiology of COPD, but it can be leveraged to directly identify novel key mediators of this

method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples.\n\n Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures.\n\n Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets.\n\n These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.\n\ng.\n\n cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data.\n\n While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.\n\n\nResults\nThe WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis.\n\n The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software.\n\n Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials.\n\n While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.\n\ng.\n\n co-expression network analysis of gene expression data.\n\n The R package

integrated quantitative lipidomics and proteomics to investigate exposure effects on lung lipid metabolism in a C57BL/6 and an Apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe?/?) mouse study.\n In these studies, mice were exposed to high concentrations of 3R4F reference CS, aerosol from potential modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs) or filtered air (Sham) for up to 8 months.\n The 2 assessed MRTPs, the prototypical MRTP for C57BL/6 mice and the Tobacco Heating System 2.2 for Apoe?/? mice, utilize “heat-not-burn” technologies and were each matched in nicotine concentrations to the 3R4F CS.\n After 2 months of CS exposure, some groups were either switched to the MRTP or underwent cessation.\n In both mouse strains, CS strongly affected several categories of lung lipids and lipid-related proteins.\n Candidate surfactant lipids, surfactant proteins, and surfactant metabolizing proteins were increased.\n Inflammatory eicosanoids, their metabolic enzymes, and several ceramide classes were elevated.\n Overall, CS induced a coordinated lipid response controlled by transcription regulators such as SREBP proteins and supported by other metabolic adaptations.\n In contrast, most of these changes were absent in the mice exposed to the potential MRTPs, in the cessation group, and the switching group.\n Our findings demonstrate the complex biological response of the lungs to CS

sample size, but knowledge of the reversibility of smoking effects on metabolite profiles is limited.\n\n Here, we extend our metabolomics study with a large prospective study including female smokers and quitters.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing targeted metabolomics approach, we quantified 140 metabolite concentrations for 1,241 fasting serum samples in the population-based Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) human cohort at two time points: baseline survey conducted between 1999 and 2001 and follow-up after seven years.\n\n Metabolite profiles were compared among groups of current smokers, former smokers and never smokers, and were further assessed for their reversibility after smoking cessation.\n\n Changes in metabolite concentrations from baseline to the follow-up

addition, we constructed protein-metabolite networks with smoking-related genes and metabolites.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 21 smoking-related metabolites in the baseline investigation (18 in men and six in women, with three overlaps) enriched in amino acid and lipid pathways, which were significantly different between current smokers and never smokers.\n\n Moreover, 19 out of the 21 metabolites

biomarkers were differentially-correlated with lung function parameters and used to generate a COPD prediction model possessing 87.8% sensitivity and 86.5% specificity.\n In an independent validation set, this model correctly predicted COPD in 8/10 individuals.\n These serum biomarkers included myoinositol, glycerophopshoinositol, fumarate, cysteinesulfonic acid, a modified version of fibrinogen peptide B (mFBP), and three doubly-charged peptides with undefined sequence that significantly and positively correlate with mFBP levels.\n Together, elevated levels of serum mFBP and additional disease-associated biomarkers point to a role for chronic inflammation, thrombosis, and oxidative stress in remodeling of the COPD airways.\n Serum metabolite biomarkers offer a promising and accessible window for recognition of early-stage COPD.\n","id":"PMC4682670","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qiuying","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruba

They also had higher DHA levels compared to smokers: 4.81 % (2.79–10.21) and 4.13 % (2.33–7.73), respectively, p?&lt;?0.05. The other PUFAs showed no significant differences between the two groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nSmokers ate less fish rich in omega3 fatty acids than non-smokers, showing and inverse and significant relationship between omega3 intake and smoking.\n\n Smokers had lower levels of DHA and EPA, a not previously reported finding.\n\n Considering that PUFAs probably interfere in smoking habit, the increase in omega-3 consumption may become a perspective in prevention or treatment of smoking.\n\n However, this inference must be evaluated through specific studies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4804563","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nóris","surname":"Scaglia","email":"noris@ipcq.com.br","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"José","surname":"Chatkin","email":"jmchatkin@pucrs.br","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kenneth

the effective prevention and control of COVID?19 in China, the number of cured cases has increased significantly.\n\n Further monitoring of the disease prognosis and effective control of the “relapse” of the epidemic has become the next focus of work.\n\n This study analysed the clinical prognosis of discharged COVID?19 patients by monitoring their SAR?CoV?2 nucleic acid status, which provided a theoretical basis for medical institutions to formulate discharge standards and follow?up management for COVID?19 patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe included 13 discharged COVID?19 patients who were quarantined for 4 weeks at home.\n\n The patient's daily clinical signs were recorded and sputum and faecal specimens were regularly sent for detection of SARS?CoV?2 nucleic acid.\n\n\nResults\nThe time between initial symptoms and meeting discharge criteria was 18 to 44 days with an average of 25?±?6 days.\n\n The faecal samples of two patients still tested positive after meeting the discharge criteria and the sputum samples of four patients returned positive 5 to 14 days after discharge.\n\n The rate of the recurring positive test result in samples from the respiratory system was 31% (4/13).\n\n\nConclusion\nUnder the present discharge criteria, the high presence of SARS?CoV?2 nucleic acid in faecal and respiratory samples of discharged COVID?19 patients indicates potential infectivity.\n\n Therefore, we suggest that faecal virus nucleic acid should be tested as a routine monitoring index for COVID?19 and a negative result be added to the criteria.\n\n Simultaneously, we should strengthen the regular follow?up of discharged patients with continuous monitoring of the recurrence of viral nucleic acid.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7264799","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Youjiang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"

city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents.\n Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human.\n In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations.\n Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019-nCoV

single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including

characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41

immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but gained little information on the organ distribution of SARS?associated coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS?CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS?CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS?CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS.\n SARS?CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle.\n These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS?CoV may also be targets of SARS?CoV infection.\n The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS?CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection.\n In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS?CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission.\n This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS?CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways.\n This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS.\n Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n

potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records","abstract":"Background\nPrevious studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods.\n\n\nFindings\nFever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days.\n\n In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites.\n\n Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission.\n\n Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001).\n\n SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14.
