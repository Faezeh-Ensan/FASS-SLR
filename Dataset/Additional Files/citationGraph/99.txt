Hong Kong: ten cross-sectional surveys","abstract":"Background\nFew studies have investigated associations between psychological and behavioral indices throughout a major epidemic.\n\n This study was aimed to compare the strength of associations between different cognitive and affective measures of risk and self-reported protective behaviors in a series of ten cross-sectional surveys conducted throughout the first wave of influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.\n\n\nMethods\nAll surveys were conducted using questionnaire-based telephone interviews, with random digit dialing to recruit adults from the general population.\n\n Measures of anxiety and worry (affective) and perceived risk (cognitive) regarding A/H1N1 were made in 10 serial surveys.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the cognitive/affective-behavioral associations in each survey while multilevel logistic models were conducted to estimate the average effects of each cognitive/affective measure on adoption of protective behaviors throughout the ten surveys.\n\n\nResults\nExcepting state anxiety, other affective measures including “anticipated worry”, “experienced worry” and “current worry” specific to A/H1N1 risk were consistently and strongly associated with adoption of protective behaviors across different survey periods.\n\n However, the cognitive-behavioral associations were weaker and inconsistent across the ten surveys.\n\n Perceived A/H1N1 severity relative to SARS had stronger associations with adoption of protective behaviors in the late epidemic periods than in the early epidemic periods.\n\n\nConclusion\nRisk-specific worries appear to be significantly associated with the adoption of protective behaviors at different epidemic stages, whereas cognitive measures may become more important in understanding people’s behavioral responses later in epidemics.\n\n Future epidemic-related psycho-behavioral research should include more affective-loaded measures of risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3986671","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qiuyan","surname":"Liao","email":"qyliao11@hku.hk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin

event.\n\n\nPurpose\nThe present article aims to review theoretical models and concepts underlying current empirical research on pandemic influenza risk perception.\n\n\nMethod\nA review was conducted based on 28 empirical studies from 30 articles which were published between 2003 and 2007.\nResults\nConcepts of risk perception mostly seemed more pragmatic than theory-based and were highly heterogeneous, for instance, in terms of conceptualizing risk perception as an exclusively cognitive or as a cognitive and emotional phenomenon or whether the concept was dominated by expectancy or expectancy and value components.\n\n Similarly, the majority of studies investigating risk perceptions and protective behaviors were not model-based.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe current body of knowledge can only provide preliminary insights.\n\n Unlike the reviewed studies, which were mostly launched as a rapid response to outbreak situations, future research will have to invest more strongly into theoretical work to provide sounder evidence.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7090865","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anja","surname":"Leppin","email":"aleppin@health.sdu.dk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Arja

influenza in Australia: Using telephone surveys to measure perceptions of threat and willingness to comply","abstract":"Background\nBaseline data is necessary for monitoring how a population perceives the threat of pandemic influenza, and perceives how it would behave in the event of pandemic influenza.\n\n Our aim was to develop a module of questions for use in telephone health surveys on perceptions of threat of pandemic influenza, and on preparedness to comply with specific public health behaviours in the event of pandemic influenza.\n\n\nMethods\nA module of questions was developed and field tested on 192 adults using the New South Wales Department of Health's in-house Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) facility.\n\n The questions were then modified and re field tested on 202 adults.\n\n The module was then incorporated into the New South Wales Population Health Survey in the first quarter of 2007. A representative sample of 2,081 adults completed the module.\n\n Their responses were weighted against the state population.\n\n\nResults\nThe reliability of the questions was acceptable with kappa ranging between 0.25 and 0.51. Overall 14.9% of the state population thought pandemic influenza was very or extremely likely to occur; 45.5% were very or extremely concerned that they or their family would be affected by pandemic influenza if it occurred; and 23.8% had made some level of change to the way they live their life because of the possibility of pandemic influenza.\n\n In the event of pandemic influenza, the majority of the population were willing to: be vaccinated (75.4%), be isolated (70.2%), and wear a face mask (59.9%).\n\n People with higher levels of threat perception are significantly more likely to be willing to comply with specific public health behaviours.\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile only 14.9% of the state population thought pandemic influenza was very or extremely likely to occur, a significantly higher proportion were concerned for self and family should a pandemic actually occur.\n\n The baseline data collected in this survey will be useful for monitoring changes over time in the population's perceptions of threat, and preparedness to comply with specific public health behaviours.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2556339","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Margo","surname":"Barr","email":"meyes@doh.health.nsw.gov.au","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Beverley","surname":"Raphael","email":"beverley.raphael@uws.edu.au","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Melanie","surname":"Taylor","email":"melanie.taylor@uws.edu.au","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Garry","surname":"Stevens","email":"g.stevens@uws.edu.au","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Louisa","surname":"Jorm","email":"louisa.jorm@saxinstitute.org.au","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Giffin","email":"mgiff@doh.health.nsw.gov.au","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sanja","surname":"Lujic","email":"s.lujic@uws.edu.au","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1086/429923","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Longitudinal

2009 were tested against theory and data-derived hypothesized associations between trust in (formal/informal) information, understanding, self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility and worry, and hand hygiene and social distancing using Structural Equation Modelling with multigroup comparisons.\n\n\nPrincipal Findings\nTrust in formal (government/media) information about influenza was associated with greater reported understanding of A/H1N1 cause (??=?0.36) and A/H1N1 prevention self-efficacy (??=?0.25), which in turn were associated with more hand hygiene (??=?0.19 and ??=?0.23, respectively).\n\n Trust in informal (interpersonal) information was negatively associated with perceived personal A/H1N1 susceptibility (??=??0.21), which was negatively associated with perceived self-efficacy (??=??0.42) but positively associated with influenza worry (??=?0.44).\n\n Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry (??=?0.16) which was in turn associated with greater social distancing (??=?0.36).\n\n Multigroup comparisons showed gender differences regarding paths from trust in formal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, trust in informal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, and understanding of A/H1N1 cause to perceived self-efficacy.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nTrust in government/media information was more strongly associated with greater self-efficacy and handwashing, whereas trust in informal information was strongly associated with perceived health threat and avoidance behaviour.\n\n Risk

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern","abstract":"","id":"PMC7135038","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"cyh-birm@263.net","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter W","surname":"Horby","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick G","surname":"Hayden","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1007.030703","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS Control and Psychological Effects of Quarantine, Toronto, Canada","abstract":"Explores effects of quarantine on those quarantined for SARS, Toronto, Canada","id":"PMC3323345","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Hawryluck","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wayne L.","surname":"Gold","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Robinson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Pogorski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sandro","surname":"Galea","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rima","surname":"Styra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/jcm9020330","date":"2020-01-23","title":"The Extent of Transmission of Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, 2020","abstract":"A cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported by China in late December 2019.

unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth.\n The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation.\n We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0.\n Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.\n The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403–540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18–25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.\n We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49–2.63).\n Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.\n","id":"PMC7074332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinjun","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangpu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daozhou","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities.\n At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down.\n It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities.\n

relatively understudied.\n\n This cross-sectional study sought to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities and associated coping styles within the general population visiting community health care services.\n\n\nMethods\nIt was conducted on individuals attending community polyclinics in Singapore within the first week of July 2003, 16 weeks after the first national outbreak of SARS.\n\n The General Health Questionnaire-28, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Brief COPE were used to determine the prevalence rates of psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities and employed coping strategies respectively.\n\n\nResults\nThe overall response rate was 78.0%.\n\n Of the 415 community health care setting respondents, we found significant rates of SARS-related psychiatric (22.9%) and posttraumatic morbidities (25.8%).\n\n The presence of psychiatric morbidity was associated with the presence of high level of posttraumatic symptoms [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24–4.13, P=.\n\n008].\n\n Psychiatric morbidity was further associated with being seen at fever stations (adjusted

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire.\n\n Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access.\n\n\nIn addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6).\n\n The total Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n The perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level and the number of physical symptoms were associated with higher IES-R Score (P&lt;.\n\n05).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis is one of the first few studies demonstrating the use of Internet in data collection during an air-pollution crisis.\n\n Our results demonstrated that the newer technological modalities have the potential to acquire data, similar to that of conventional technologies.\n\n Demographic variables did not influence the mechanism of usage.\n\n In addition, our findings also suggested that there are acute physical and psychological impacts on the population from an air-pollution crisis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4114481","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sary","surname":"Beidas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sary","surname":"Beidas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fernando","surname":"Mora","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Monica","surname":"Murero","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Melvyn

download applications in various application stores.\n\n Smartphone applications have been proven to be useful for youths in various aspects.\n\n However, there has been a paucity of data looking into the preferences of Vietnamese youths and adolescents with regards to health-related applications and their receptiveness towards smartphone apps.\n\n Therefore, this study aimed to determine the receptiveness and preferences of health-related smartphone applications (mHealth apps) among online Vietnamese youths and adolescents.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>An online cross-sectional study was conducted between the periods of August till October 2015 in Vietnam.\n\n Respondent-driven sampling technique (RDS) was utilized to recruit participants.\n\n Participants were asked questions about their history of downloading and using health-related smartphone applications and their receptiveness when using these applications.\n\n Moreover, socio-demographic characteristics and health status

compared PHQ-9 scores with major depression diagnoses from validated diagnostic interviews.\n\n Primary study data and study level data extracted from primary reports were synthesized.\n\n For PHQ-9 cut-off scores 5-15, bivariate random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity, separately, among studies that used semistructured diagnostic interviews, which are designed for administration by clinicians; fully structured interviews, which are designed for lay administration; and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric (MINI) diagnostic interviews, a brief fully structured interview.\n\n Sensitivity and specificity were examined among participant subgroups and, separately, using meta-regression, considering all subgroup variables in a single model.\n\n\nResults\nData were obtained for 58 of 72 eligible studies (total n=17?357; major depression cases n=2312).\n\n Combined sensitivity and specificity was maximized at a cut-off score of 10 or above among studies using a semistructured interview (29 studies, 6725 participants; sensitivity 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.92; specificity 0.85, 0.82 to 0.88).\n\n Across cut-off scores 5-15, sensitivity with semistructured interviews was 5-22% higher than for fully structured interviews (MINI excluded; 14 studies, 7680 participants) and 2-15% higher than for the MINI (15 studies, 2952 participants).\n\n Specificity was similar across diagnostic interviews.\n\n The PHQ-9 seems to be similarly sensitive but may be less specific for younger patients than for older patients; a cut-off score of 10 or above can be used regardless of age.\n\n.\n\n\nConclusions\nPHQ-9 sensitivity compared with semistructured diagnostic interviews was greater than in previous conventional meta-analyses that combined reference standards.\n\n A cut-off score of 10 or above maximized combined sensitivity and specificity overall and for subgroups.\n\n\nRegistration\nPROSPERO

body and behaviour that may affect mental health.\n\n We found that no study measures the depression and anxiety in adolescence in our region, so we want to measure it and then try to improve our community.\n\n\nAim:\nWe aim to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among high school students at Qassim region.\n\n\nMethods:\nA cross-sectional study done in al-Qassim region.\n\n A targeted population was secondary school students.\n\n The sample size was 1245 students.\n\n We used the questionnaire tool the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression in the students and the GAD7 for anxiety.\n\n The data had been gathered through MS Excel then exported to the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) for analyses.\n\n A P value cut-off point of 0.05 at 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to determine statistical significance.\n\n The analyses measure the association between socio-demographic and other related variables in the survey by using a Chi-square test.\n\n\nResult:\nOur study shows that depression by using (PHQ-9) among the 1245 students, 325 (26.0%) were not depressed, 423 (34%) were mildly depressed, 306 (24.6%) were moderately depressed, whereas 129 (10.4%) were moderately severe depressed and 62 (5.0%) were severely depressed.\n\n Anxiety by using the GAD-7 questionnaire, it was revealed that out of 1245 students, 455 (36.5%) of them were without anxiety, 425 (34.1%) of them were having mild anxiety, 243 (19.5%) of them were having moderate anxiety and 122 (9.8%) were having severe anxiety.\n\n Depression and anxiety, according to gender (P value &lt;0.001), show a significant relationship.\n\n\nConclusion:\nWe have to raise the awareness of the mental health in our community as the prevalence of mental disorder has significantly increased over time.\n\n Health services should make health education for students on how they deal with stress and depression through exercise and good sleep.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6436297","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Reem","surname":"Alharbi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Khalid","surname":"Alsuhaibani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abdullah","surname":"Almarshad","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abdulhameed","surname":"Alyahya","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

prevalence of DSM-IV disorders and comorbidity in a large school-based sample of 6–17 year old children and adolescents in northeast China.\n\n\nMethods\nA two-phase cross-sectional study was conducted on 9,806 children.\n\n During the screening phase, 8848 children (90.23%) and their mothers and teachers were interviewed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).\n\n During the diagnostic phase, 1129 children with a positive SDQ and 804 randomly selected children with a negative SDQ (11%), and their mothers and teachers, were interviewed using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA).\n\n\nResults\nThe overall prevalence of DSM-IV disorders was 9.49% (95% CI?=?8.10–11.10%).\n\n Anxiety disorders were the most common (6.06%, 95% CI?=?4.92–7.40), followed by depression (1.32%, 95% CI?=?0.91–1.92%), oppositional defiant disorder (1.21%, 95%CI?=?0.77–1.87) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (0.84%, 95% CI?=?0.52–1.36%).\n\n Of the 805

therefore, a novel mobile app (Reactivate) was developed for use in the Temple Street W82GO Healthy Lifestyles Program (W82GO).\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aimed to test the usability (technical effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction) of the Reactivate mobile app in obese adolescents.\n\n\nMethods\nTen adolescents (7 males and 3 females, aged 12-17 years) who had been treated for obesity (&gt;98th percentile for body mass index) at the Temple Street Children's University Hospital were recruited.\n\n Participants were given 8 tasks to complete in order to test the technical effectiveness of the app.\n\n A research assistant timed the user while completing each task in order to test the relative user efficiency of the app (time-on-task).\n\n The tasks fell into 5 categories and required the user to enter personal settings, find and answer surveys, create a message, use the goal setting feature, and enter details regarding their weight and height.\n\n In exploration of user satisfaction, each participant completed the standardized software usability measurement inventory (SUMI), which measures 5 aspects of user satisfaction: efficiency, effect, helpfulness, controllability, and learnability.\n\n Descriptive statistics were used to explore the mean relative user efficiency and SUMI scores.\n\n\nResults\nMean age was 14.26 (SD 1.58) years.\n\n All adolescents completed each of the tasks successfully.\n\n The mean relative user efficiency scores were two to three times that of an expert user.\n\n Users responded that they would use Reactivate to monitor their growth over time, for motivation, and for goal setting.\n\n All users described Reactivate as an important mobile app.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur study describes the usability of a mobile app used in adolescent obesity management.\n\n Adolescents found Reactivate easy to use and their SUMI results indicated that the app scored high on user satisfaction.\n\n Usability testing is an important step towards refining the development of the Reactivate app, which can be used in the treatment of obesity.\n\n The study on the clinical efficacy of the Reactivate app is currently underway.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4114470","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eleanor","surname":"Tate","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eleanor","surname":"Tate","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Cudd","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Grace","surname":"O'Malley","email":"omalleyg@tcd.ie","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Grace","surname":"O'Malley","email":"omalleyg@tcd.ie","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Grainne","surname":"Dowdall","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amanda","surname":"Burls","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivan J","surname":"Perry","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Noirin","surname":"Curran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Majeed-Ariss R, Hall AG, McDonagh J, Fallon D, Swallow V.

in Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations With Mental and Social Health","abstract":"Purpose\nReducing the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted recommendations for individuals to socially distance.\n\n Little is known about the extent to which youth are socially distancing, what motivations underlie their social distancing, and how these motivations are connected with amount of social distancing, mental health, and social health.\n\n Using a large sample of adolescents from across the United States, this study examined adolescents' motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health.\n\n\nMethods\nData were collected on March 29th and 30th, 2020, two weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the United States.\n\n The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media.\n\n A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness.\n\n\nResults\nAlmost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing.\n\n The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick.\n\n Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing.\n\n Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents' anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness.\n\n\nConclusions\nUnderstanding adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing may inform strategies to increase social distancing engagement, reduce pathogen transmission, and identify individual differences in mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7205689","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Benjamin","surname":"Oosterhoff","email":"Benjamin.oosterhoff@montana.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

recent years, and methods to improve the reliability and validity of PRO instruments are advancing.\n\n This paper discusses the cognitive interviewing procedures employed by the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pediatrics group for the purpose of developing a dynamic, electronic item bank for field testing with children and adolescents using novel computer technology.\n\n The primary objective of this study was to conduct cognitive interviews with children and adolescents to gain feedback on items measuring physical functioning, emotional health, social health, fatigue, pain, and asthma-specific symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 88 cognitive interviews were conducted with 77 children and adolescents across two sites on 318 items.\n\n From this initial item bank, 25 items were deleted and 35 were revised and underwent a second round of cognitive interviews.\n\n A total of 293 items were retained for field testing.\n\n\nResults\nChildren as young as 8 years of age were able to comprehend the majority of items, response options, directions, recall period, and identify problems with language that was difficult for them to understand.\n\n Cognitive interviews indicated issues with item comprehension on several items which led to alternative wording for these items.\n\n\nConclusion\nChildren ages 8–17 years were able to comprehend most item stems and response options in the present study.\n\n Field testing with the resulting items and response options is presently being conducted as part of the PROMIS Pediatric Item Bank development process.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2642767","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Debra

Midwest pediatric nephrology consortium study","abstract":"Background and objectives\nNephrotic syndrome (NS) represents a common disease in pediatric nephrology typified by a relapsing and remitting course and characterized by the presence of edema that can significantly affect the health-related quality of life in children and adolescents.\n\n The PROMIS pediatric measures were constructed to be publically available, efficient, precise, and valid across a variety of diseases to assess patient reports of symptoms and quality of life.\n\n This study was designed to evaluate the ability of children and adolescents with NS to complete the PROMIS assessment via computer and to initiate validity assessments of the short forms and full item banks in pediatric NS.\n\n Successful measurement of patient reported outcomes will contribute to our understanding of the impact of NS on children and adolescents.\n\n\nDesign\nThis cross-sectional study included 151 children and adolescents 8-17 years old with NS from 16 participating institutions in North America.\n\n The children completed the PROMIS pediatric depression, anxiety, social-peer relationships, pain interference, fatigue, mobility and upper extremity functioning measures using a web-based interface.\n\n Responses were compared between patients experiencing active NS (n?=?53) defined by the presence of edema and patients with inactive NS (n?=?96) defined by the absence of edema.\n\n\nResults\nAll 151 children and adolescents were successfully able to complete the PROMIS assessment via computer.\n\n As hypothesized, the children and adolescents with active NS were significantly different on 4 self-reported measures (anxiety, pain interference, fatigue, and mobility).\n\n Depression, peer relationships, and upper extremity functioning were not different between children with active vs.\n\n inactive NS.\n\n Multivariate analysis showed that the PROMIS instruments remained sensitive to NS disease activity after adjusting for demographic characteristics.\n\n\nConclusions\nChildren and adolescents with NS were able to successfully complete the PROMIS instrument using a web-based interface.\n\n The computer based pediatric PROMIS measurement effectively discriminated between children and adolescents with active and inactive NS.\n\n The domain scores found in this study are consistent with previous reports investigating the health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with NS.\n\n This study establishes known-group validity and feasibility for PROMIS pediatric measures in children and adolescents with NS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3599189","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Debbie

life for children with severe obesity","abstract":"Background\nChildhood obesity is a growing health concern known to adversely affect quality of life in children and adolescents.\n\n The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pediatric measures were developed to capture child self-reports across a variety of health conditions experienced by children and adolescents.\n\n The purpose of this study is to begin the process of validation of the PROMIS pediatric measures in children and adolescents affected by obesity.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pediatric PROMIS instruments were administered to 138 children and adolescents in a cross-sectional study of patient reported outcomes in children aged 8–17 years with age-adjusted body mass index (BMI) greater than the 85th percentile in a design to establish known-group validity.\n\n The children completed the depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, peer relationships, pain interference, fatigue, upper extremity, and mobility PROMIS domains utilizing a computer interface.\n\n PROMIS domains and individual items were administered in random order and included a total of 95 items.\n\n Patient responses were compared between patients with BMI 85 to?&lt;?99th percentile versus???99th percentile.\n\n\nResults\n136 participants were recruited and had all necessary clinical data for analysis.\n\n Of the 136 participants, 5% ended the survey early resulting in missing domain scores at the end of survey administration.\n\n In multivariate analysis, patients with BMI???99th percentile had worse scores for depressive symptoms, anger, fatigue, and mobility (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n Parent-reported exercise was associated with better scores for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and fatigue (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions\nChildren and adolescents ranging from overweight to severely obese can complete multiple PROMIS pediatric measures using a computer interface in the outpatient setting.\n\n In the 5% with missing domain scores, the missing scores were consistently found in the domains administered last, suggesting the length of the assessment is important.\n\n The differences in domain scores found in this study are consistent with previous reports investigating the quality of life in children and adolescents with obesity.\n\n We show that the PROMIS instrument represents a feasible and potentially valuable instrument for the future study of the effect of pediatric obesity on quality of life.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3598567","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David

post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger.\n Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma.\n Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects.\n In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided.\n Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to

(OCD) is a heterogeneous condition with a few major symptom dimensions.\n\n These symptom dimensions are thought to have unique clinical and neurobiological correlates.\n\n There seems to be a specific relation between OCD symptom dimensions and obsessive beliefs, but the findings are not consistent across studies.\n\n There is also a paucity of literature from culturally diverse settings.\n\n One of the reasons for the varied findings could be due to the method employed in measuring OCD symptoms.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nIn this study, we examined the relation between symptom dimensions and obsessive beliefs using the Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire respectively in 75 patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition OCD.\n\n\nResults:\nPerfectionism predicted both aggressive and symmetry dimensions whereas responsibility beliefs predicted sexual and religious dimensions.\n\n\nConclusions:\nThe findings suggest that certain obsessive beliefs predicted certain OCD symptom dimensions, but results are not entirely consistent with the published literature suggesting the possibility of cross-cultural variations.\n\n That the symptom dimensions have unique belief domains support the argument that symptom dimensions could be targeted to reduce the heterogeneity in etiological and treatment studies of OCD.\n\n Therapeutic interventions may have to aim at modifying unique belief domains underlying certain symptom dimensions rather than having generic cognitive-behavioral strategies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4676205","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Trinette","surname":"Cordeiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mahendra

and clinical utility of the obsessive compulsive inventory - child version: further evaluation in clinical samples","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder.\n\n Currently, the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Child Version (OCI-CV) is the only self-report measure that fully captures this symptom heterogeneity in children and adolescents.\n\n The psychometric properties of the OCI-CV are promising but evaluations in large clinical samples are few.\n\n Further, no studies have examined whether the measure is valid in both younger and older children with OCD and whether scores on the measure are elevated in youths with OCD compared to youths with other mental disorders.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>To address these gaps in the literature, we investigated the psychometric properties and validity of a Swedish version of the OCI-CV in a large clinical sample of youth aged 6–18?years with OCD (n?=?434), anxiety disorders (n?=?84), and chronic tic disorders (n?=?45).\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Internal consistency coefficients at the total scale and subscale level were consistent with the English original and in the acceptable range.\n\n Confirmatory factor analyses revealed an adequate fit for the original six-factor structure in both younger and older children with OCD.\n\n Correlations between total scores on the OCI-CV and the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) were small at pre-treatment (r?=?0.19) but large at post-treatment (r?=?0.62).\n\n Youth with OCD scored higher than those with anxiety and chronic tic disorders, and the OCI-CV was sensitive to symptom change for youth undergoing treatment for OCD.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>This Swedish version of the OCI-CV appears to be a valid and reliable measure of the OCD symptom dimensions across age groups and has good clinical utility.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6998300","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kristina","surname":"Aspvall","email":"kristina.aspvall@ki.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matti","surname":"Cervin","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Matti","surname":"Cervin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Per","surname":"Andrén","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sean","surname":"Perrin","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Mataix-Cols","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erik","surname":"Andersson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The

the main symptom dimensions of OCD (aggressive, symmetry, contamination) and the degree to which fear, incompleteness, and disgust accompanied these symptoms.\n For comparison purposes, the degree of fear, incompleteness, and disgust during symptoms was obtained also from youth with social anxiety disorder (SAD; n?=?27) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n?=?28).\n Participants with OCD reported that all three emotions were involved in their symptoms; however, fear was most strongly linked to aggressive symptoms, incompleteness to symmetry symptoms, and disgust to contamination symptoms.\n Incompleteness differentiated youth with OCD from those with SAD and GAD.\n No differences for these emotions were found for youth with OCD with versus without the tic-disorder subtype or comorbid autism.\n A positive association between incompleteness and self-reported hoarding emerged among youth with OCD.\n Further studies of the emotional architecture of pediatric OCD, and its relationship to etiology and treatment, are

a danger or a stimulus predicting immediate danger is perceived.\n Its role is to prepare the body to face this danger.\n However, dysfunction in fear processing can lead to psychiatric disorders in which fear outweighs the danger or possibility of harm.\n Although recognized as highly debilitating, pathological fear remains insufficiently treated, indicating the importance of research on fear processing.\n The neurobiological basis of normal and pathological fear reactions is reviewed in this article.\n Innate and learned fear mechanisms, particularly those involving the amygdala, are considered.\n These fear mechanisms are also distinguished in specific phobias, which can indeed be nonexperiential (implicating innate, learning-independent mechanisms) or experiential (implicating learning-dependent mechanisms).\n Poor habituation and poor extinction are presented as dysfunctional mechanisms contributing to persistence of nonexperiential and experiential phobias,

cognitive-affective processes.\n A better understanding of processes underpinning ED may have important implications for treatment development.\n Two studies were conducted that investigated levels of rumination, beliefs about rumination, experiential avoidance, and aspects of schematic thinking in individuals with eating pathology.\n The latter was assessed with a newly designed ED-Sentence Completion Task (ED-SCT).\n Study 1 (N = 177) examined relations between ED psychopathology and these variables in a student population.\n Extending this, Study 2 (N = 26) assessed differences between patients with anorexia nervosa and healthy control participants.\n The results showed that ED psychopathology was related to disorder-specific cognitions, experiential avoidance as well as ruminative brooding but not reflection.\n A follow-up of anorexia nervosa patients indicated that changes in ED psychopathology were associated with changes in dysfunctional attitudes and maladaptive cognitive-affective processes.\n These findings highlight cognitive processes that may play an important role in the maintenance of eating

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"  .

West Africa Ebola virus disease pandemic was the largest, longest, deadliest, and most geographically expansive outbreak in the 40-year interval since Ebola was first identified.\n Fear-related behaviors played an important role in shaping the outbreak.\n Fear-related behaviors are defined as “individual or collective behaviors and actions initiated in response to fear reactions that are triggered by a perceived threat or actual exposure to a potentially traumatizing event.\n FRBs modify the future risk of harm.\n” This review examines how fear-related behaviors were implicated in (1) accelerating the spread of Ebola, (2) impeding the utilization of life-saving Ebola treatment, (3) curtailing the availability of medical services for treatable conditions, (4) increasing the risks for new-onset psychological distress and psychiatric disorders, and (5) amplifying the downstream cascades of social problems.\n Fear-related behaviors are identified for each of these outcomes.\n Particularly notable are behaviors such as treating Ebola patients in home or private clinic settings, the “laying of hands” on Ebola-infected individuals to perform faith-based healing, observing hands-on funeral and burial customs, foregoing available life-saving treatment, and stigmatizing Ebola survivors and health professionals.\n Future directions include modeling the onset, operation, and perpetuation of fear-related behaviors and devising strategies to redirect behavioral responses to mass threats in a manner that reduces risks and promotes resilience.\n","id":"PMC5241909","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"James

Four hundred and twenty five people developed clinical symptoms in three geographically distinct parts of the country (Gulu, Masindi, and Mbarara), of whom 224 (53%) died.\n\n Given the focus of previous social scientific Ebola research on experiences in communities that have been directly affected, this article expands the lens to include responses to the outbreak in local, national, and international contexts over the course of the outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nResponses to the outbreak were gauged through the articles, editorials, cartoons, and letters that were published in the country’s two main English language daily national newspapers: the New Vision and the Monitor (now the Daily Monitor).\n\n All the relevant pieces from these two sources over the course of the epidemic were cut out, entered onto a computer, and the originals filed.\n\n The three a priori codes, based on the local, national, and international levels, were expanded into six, to include issues that emerged inductively during analysis.\n\n The data within each code were subsequently worked into coherent, chronological narratives.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 639 cuttings were included in the analysis.\n\n Strong and varied responses to the outbreak were identified from across the globe.\n\n These included, among others: confusion, anger, and serious stigma in affected communities; medical staff working themselves to exhaustion, with some quitting their posts; patients fleeing from hospitals; calls on spiritual forces for protection against infection; a well-coordinated national control strategy; and the imposition of some international travel restrictions.\n\n Responses varied both quantitatively and qualitatively according to the level (i.\n\ne.\n\n local, national, or international) at which they were manifested.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe Ugandan experience of 2000/2001 demonstrates that responses to an Ebola outbreak can be very dramatic, but perhaps disproportionate to the actual danger presented.\n\n An important objective for any future outbreak control strategy must be to prevent excessive fear, which, it is expected, would reduce stigma and other negative outcomes.\n\n To this end, the value of openness in the provision of public information, and critically, of being seen to be open, cannot be overstated.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3477054","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"John","surname":"Kinsman","email":"john.kinsman@epiph.umu.se","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMp1409859","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ebola virus disease in West Africa:no early end to the outbreak","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMp1411244","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ebola in a stew of fear","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/WTF.0000000000000079","date":"1970-01-01","title":"An outbreak of fear, rumours and stigma: psychosocial support for the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Behavioural and emotional responses to the 2014 Ebola Outbreak in Nigeria: a narrative review","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0129179","date":"2015-05-05","title":"Mass Media and the Contagion of Fear: The Case of Ebola in America","abstract":"Background\nIn the weeks following the first imported case of Ebola in the U.\n\n S.\n\n on September 29, 2014, coverage of the very limited outbreak dominated the news media, in a manner quite disproportionate to the actual threat to national public health; by the end of October, 2014, there were only four laboratory confirmed cases of Ebola in the entire nation.\n\n Public interest in these events was high, as reflected in the millions of Ebola-related Internet searches and tweets performed in the month following the first confirmed case.\n\n Use of trending Internet searches and tweets has been proposed in the past for real-time prediction of outbreaks (a field referred to as “digital epidemiology”), but accounting for the biases of public panic has been problematic.\n\n In the case of the limited U.\n\n S.\n\n Ebola outbreak, we know that the Ebola-related searches and tweets originating the U.\n\n S.\n\n during the outbreak were due only to public interest or panic, providing an unprecedented means to determine how these dynamics affect such data, and how news media may be driving these trends.\n\n\nMethodology\nWe examine daily Ebola-related Internet search and Twitter data in the U.\n\n S.\n\n during the six week period ending Oct 31, 2014.

Surveys were completed by 3426 employees (18.4%), approximately one third of whom were health professionals.\n\n\nResults\nDemographic and professional distribution of respondents was similar to all

additional 10% were willing if required.\n\n One-third (32%) of participants reported they would be unwilling to respond in the event of a more severe pandemic influenza scenario.\n\n These response rates were consistent across different departments, and were one-third lower among nurses as compared with physicians.\n\n Respondents who were hesitant to agree to work additional hours when required

to Respond to Pandemic Influenza Using a Threat- and Efficacy-Based Assessment Framework","abstract":"Background\nEmergency Medical Services workers' willingness to report to duty in an influenza pandemic is essential to healthcare system surge amidst a global threat.\n\n Application of Witte's Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) has shown utility for revealing influences of perceived threat and efficacy on non-EMS public health providers' willingness to respond in an influenza pandemic.\n\n We thus propose using an EPPM-informed assessment of EMS workers' perspectives toward fulfilling their influenza pandemic response roles.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe administered an EPPM-informed snapshot survey about attitudes and beliefs toward pandemic influenza response, to a nationally representative, stratified random sample of 1,537 U.\n\nS.\n\n EMS workers from May–June 2009 (overall response rate: 49%).\n\n Of the 586 respondents who met inclusion criteria (currently active EMS providers in primarily EMS response roles), 12% indicated they would not voluntarily report to duty in a pandemic influenza emergency if asked, 7% if required.\n\n A majority (52%) indicated their unwillingness to report to work if risk of disease transmission to family existed.\n\n Confidence in personal safety at work (OR?=?3.3) and a high threat/high efficacy (“concerned and confident”) EPPM profile (OR?=?4.7) distinguished those who were more likely to voluntarily report to duty.\n\n Although 96% of EMS workers indicated that they would probably or definitely report to work if they were guaranteed a pandemic influenza vaccine, only 59% had received an influenza immunization in the preceding 12 months.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nEMS workers' response willingness gaps pose a substantial challenge to prehospital surge capacity in an influenza pandemic.\n\n “Concerned and confident” EMS workers are more than four times as likely to fulfill pandemic influenza response expectations.\n\n Confidence in workplace safety is a positively influential modifier of their response willingness.\n\n These findings can inform insights into interventions for enhancing EMS workers' willingness to respond in the face of a global infectious disease

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern","abstract":"","id":"PMC7135038","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"cyh-birm@263.net","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter W","surname":"Horby","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick G","surname":"Hayden","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1007.030703","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS Control and Psychological Effects of Quarantine, Toronto, Canada","abstract":"Explores effects of quarantine on those quarantined for SARS, Toronto, Canada","id":"PMC3323345","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Hawryluck","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wayne L.","surname":"Gold","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Robinson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Pogorski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sandro","surname":"Galea","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rima","surname":"Styra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/jcm9020330","date":"2020-01-23","title":"The Extent of Transmission of Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, 2020","abstract":"A cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported by China in late December 2019.

a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers

unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland

of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0.\n Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.\n The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403–540)

single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25,

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from

resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and

reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

and Psychological Well-Being of Individuals in Times of a Major Air Pollution Crisis","abstract":"Background\nCrisis situations bring about many challenges to researchers, public institutions, and governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire.\n\n Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access.\n\n\nIn addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6).\n\n The total Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n The perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level and the number of physical symptoms were associated with higher IES-R Score (P&lt;.\n\n05).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis is one of the first few studies demonstrating the use of Internet in data collection during an air-pollution crisis.\n\n Our results demonstrated that the newer technological modalities have the potential to acquire data, similar to that of conventional technologies.\n\n Demographic variables did not influence the mechanism of usage.\n\n In addition, our findings also suggested that there are acute physical and psychological impacts on the population from an air-pollution crisis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4114481","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sary","surname":"Beidas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sary","surname":"Beidas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fernando","surname":"Mora","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Monica","surname":"Murero","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Melvyn

agonist maintenance treatment (MMT) is used to treat opioid addiction by preventing opioid withdrawal and reducing cravings.\n\n However, it is important to note that mental conditions may persist, or even remain undetected while methadone maintenance treatment is ongoing.\n\n This study aimed to examine the level of psychological problems among MMT patients at public and private health facilities

surveillance and treatment services in the North of Vietnam.\n\n 395 male respondents currently receiving MMT agreed to participate in a face-to-face interview.\n\n Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were used to assess psychological problems among patients.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The percentage of patients suffering from mild to extremely severe anxiety was the highest among psychological problems (18%).\n\n 2.8% of participants had mild depressive symptoms and the percentage of those having mild or moderate stress was approximately 4%.\n\n In addition, the longer treatment duration, the lower mental health scores regarding three types of psychological problems.\n\n Respondents who received MMT services in public health facilities were more likely to have a higher score of all psychological problems.\n\n Participants who lived with partners or spouse, having higher monthly family income had a lower likelihood of having severe depression and stress

Transplantation","abstract":"Background\nIn this digital era, there is a growing tendency to use the popular Internet site YouTube as a new electronic-learning (e-learning) means for continuing medical education.\n\n Heart transplantation (HTx) remains the most viable option for patients with end-stage heart failure or severe coronary artery disease.\n\n There are plenty of freely accessible YouTube videos providing medical information about HTx.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of YouTube as an e-learning source on HTx.\n\n\nMethods\nIn order to carry out this study, YouTube was searched for videos uploaded containing surgical-related information using the four keywords: (1) “heart transplantation”, (2) “cardiac transplantation”, (3) “heart transplantation operation”, and (4) “cardiac transplantation operation”.\n\n Only videos in English (with comments or subtitles in English language) were included.\n\n Two experienced cardiac surgeons watched each video (N=1800) and classified them as useful, misleading, or recipients videos based on the HTx-relevant information.\n\n The kappa statistic was used to measure interobserver variability.\n\n Data was analyzed according to six types of YouTube characteristics including “total viewership”, “duration”, “source”, “days since upload”, “scores” given by the viewers, and specialized information contents of the videos.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 342/1800 (19.00%) videos had relevant information about HTx.\n\n Of these 342 videos, 215 (62.8%) videos had useful information about specialized knowledge, 7/342 (2.0%) were found to be misleading, and 120/342 (35.1%) only concerned recipients’ individual issues.\n\n Useful videos had 56.09% of total viewership share (2,175,845/3,878,890), whereas misleading had 35.47% (1,375,673/3,878,890).\n\n Independent user channel videos accounted for a smaller proportion (19% in total numbers) but might have a wider impact on Web viewers, with the highest mean views/day (mean 39, SD 107) among four kinds of channels to distribute HTx-related information.\n\n\nConclusions\nYouTube videos on HTx benefit medical professionals by providing a substantial amount of information.\n\n However, it is a time-consuming course to find high-quality videos.\n\n More authoritative videos by trusted sources should be posted for dissemination of reliable information.\n\n With an improvement of ranking system and content providers in future, YouTube, as a freely accessible outlet, will help to meet the huge informational needs of medical staffs and promote medical education on HTx.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3841345","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Der-Ming","surname":"Liou","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Der-Ming","surname":"Liou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luis","surname":"Fernandez-Luque","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Rosemary","surname":"Thackeray","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"He-Ming","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"He-Ming","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong-Kai","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Lin","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Shun","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Bin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ling-Qing","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vinicio

Observational Case Study on Chinese Social Media During the Avian Influenza A (H7N9) Outbreak","abstract":"Background\nA hot topic on the relationship between a popular avian-origin food and avian influenza occurred on social media during the outbreak of the emerging avian influenza A (H7N9).\n\n The misinformation generated from this topic had caused great confusion and public concern.\n\n\nObjective\nOur goals were to analyze the trend and contents of the relevant posts during the outbreak.\n\n We also aimed to understand the characteristics of the misinformation and to provide suggestions to reduce public misconception on social media during the emerging disease outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nThe original microblog posts were collected from China’s Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo using a combination of keywords between April 1, 2013 and June 2, 2013. We analyzed the weekly and daily trend of the relevant posts.\n\n Content analyses were applied to categorize the posts into 4 types with unified sorting criteria.\n\n The posts’ characteristics and geographic locations were also analyzed in each category.\n\n We conducted further analysis on the top 5 most popular misleading posts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 1680 original microblog posts on the topic were retrieved and 341 (20.30%) of these posts were categorized as misleading messages.\n\n The number of relevant posts had not increased much during the first 2 weeks but rose to a high level in the next 2 weeks after the sudden increase in number of reported cases at the beginning of week 3. The posts under “misleading messages” occurred and increased from the beginning of week 3, but their daily posting number decreased when the daily number of posts under “refuting messages” outnumbered them.\n\n The microbloggers of the misleading posts had the lowest mean rank of followers and previous posts, but their posts had a highest mean rank of posts.\n\n The proportion of “misleading messages” in places with no reported cases was significantly higher than that in the epidemic areas (23.6% vs 13.8%).\n\n The popular misleading posts appeared to be short and consisted of personal narratives, which were easily disseminated on social media.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggested the importance of responding to common questions and misconceptions on social media platforms from the beginning of disease outbreaks.\n\n Authorities need to release clear and reliable information related to the popular topics early on.\n\n The microbloggers posting correct information should be empowered and their posts could be promoted to clarify false information.\n\n Equal importance should be attached to clarify misinformation in both the outbreak and nonoutbreak areas.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5897620","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nigel","surname":"Collier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mike","surname":"Conway","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nut","surname":"Limsopatham","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vasileios","surname":"Lampos","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aron","surname":"Culotta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Clementine","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Clementine","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaogang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bolin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gaofeng","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Gaofeng","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenggang","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhenggang","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuru","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yuru","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianmin","surname":"Jiang","email":"jmjiang@cdc.zj.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jianmin","surname":"Jiang","email":"jmjiang@cdc.zj.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.2196/11515","date":"2018-10-01","title":"Nature and Diffusion of Gynecologic Cancer–Related Misinformation on Social Media: Analysis of Tweets","abstract":"Background\nOver the last two decades, the incidence and mortality rates of gynecologic cancers have increased at a constant rate in China.\n\n Gynecologic cancers have become one of the most serious threats to women’s health in China.\n\n With the widespread use of social media, an increasing number of individuals have employed social media to produce, seek, and share cancer-related information.\n\n However, health information on social media is not always accurate.\n\n Health, and especially cancer-related, misinformation has been widely spread on social media, which can affect individuals’ attitudinal and behavioral responses to cancer.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to examine the nature and diffusion of gynecologic cancer–related misinformation on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 2691 tweets related to 2 gynecologic cancers—breast cancer and cervical cancer—posted on Weibo from June 2015 to June 2016 were extracted using the Python Web Crawler.\n\n Two medical school graduate students with expertise in gynecologic diseases were recruited to code the tweets to differentiate between true information and misinformation as well as to identify the types of falsehoods.\n\n The diffusion characteristics of gynecologic cancer–related misinformation were compared with those of the true information.\n\n\nResults\nWhile most of the gynecologic cancer–related tweets provided medically accurate information, approximately 30% of them were found to contain misinformation.\n\n Furthermore, it was found that tweets about cancer treatment contained a higher percentage of misinformation than prevention-related tweets.\n\n Nevertheless, the prevention-related misinformation diffused significantly more broadly and deeply than true information on social media.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe findings of this study suggest the need for controlling and reducing the cancer-related misinformation on social media with the efforts from both service providers and medical professionals.\n\n More specifically, it is important to correct falsehoods related to the prevention of gynecologic cancers on social media and increase individuals’ capacity to assess the veracity of Web-based information to curb the spread and thus minimize the consequences of cancer-related misinformation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6231818","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjing","surname":"Pian","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wenjing","surname":"Pian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shabbir","surname":"Syed

in the Age of Twitter: Content Analysis of Tweets during the 2009 H1N1 Outbreak","abstract":"Background\nSurveys are popular methods to measure public perceptions in emergencies but can be costly and time consuming.\n\n We suggest and evaluate a complementary “infoveillance” approach using Twitter during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.\n\n Our study aimed to: 1) monitor the use of the terms “H1N1” versus “swine flu” over time; 2) conduct a content analysis of “tweets”; and 3) validate Twitter as a real-time content, sentiment, and public attention trend-tracking tool.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nBetween May 1 and December 31, 2009, we archived over 2 million Twitter posts containing keywords “swine flu,” “swineflu,” and/or “H1N1.” using Infovigil, an infoveillance system.\n\n Tweets using “H1N1” increased from 8.8% to 40.5% (R\n2?=?.\n\n788; p&lt;.\n\n001), indicating a gradual adoption of World Health Organization-recommended terminology.\n\n 5,395 tweets were randomly selected from 9 days, 4 weeks apart and coded using a tri-axial coding scheme.\n\n To track tweet content and to test the feasibility of automated coding, we created database queries for keywords and correlated these results with manual coding.\n\n Content analysis indicated resource-related posts were most commonly shared (52.6%).\n\n 4.5% of cases were identified as misinformation.\n\n News websites were the most popular sources (23.2%), while government and health agencies were linked only 1.5% of the time.\n\n 7/10 automated queries correlated with manual coding.\n\n Several Twitter activity peaks coincided with major news stories.\n\n Our results correlated well with H1N1 incidence data.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study illustrates the potential of using social media to conduct “infodemiology” studies for public health.\n\n 2009 H1N1-related tweets were primarily used to disseminate information from credible sources, but were also a source of opinions and experiences.\n\n Tweets can be used for real-time content analysis and knowledge translation research, allowing health authorities to respond to public concerns.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2993925","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cynthia","surname":"Chew","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Margaret","surname":"Sampson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Margaret","surname":"Sampson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.08.010","date":"1970-01-01","title":"To

The study also found that the 2 vaccine-skeptical websites had larger digital ecologies because they linked to a variety of vaccine-related websites, including government websites.\n\n They leveraged the affordances of Web 2.0 with their interactive features and digital media.\n\n\nConclusions\nBy employing a rhetorical framework, this study found that the provaccine websites analyzed concentrate on the accurate transmission of evidence-based scientific research about vaccines and government-endorsed vaccination-related practices, whereas the vaccine-skeptical websites focus on creating communities of people affected by vaccines and vaccine-related practices.\n\n From this personal framework, these websites then challenge the information presented in scientific literature and government documents.\n\n At the same time, the vaccine-skeptical websites in this study are repositories of vaccine information and vaccination-related resources.\n\n Future studies on vaccination and the Internet should take into consideration the rhetorical features of provaccine and vaccine-skeptical websites and further investigate the influence of Web 2.0 community-building features on people seeking information about vaccine-related practices.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4468570","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Koerber","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Koerber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heidi","surname":"Lawrence","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lenny","surname":"Grant","email":"lenny@vt.edu","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lenny","surname":"Grant","email":"lenny@vt.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bernice

condition affecting over 5 million people globally and 1.6 million in the United States but currently lacks a precisely determined cause or cure.\n\n The range of symptoms IBD patients experience are often debilitating, and the societal stigmas associated with some such symptoms can further degrade their quality of life.\n\n Better understanding the nature of this public reproach then is a critical component for improving awareness campaigns and, ultimately, the experiences of IBD patients.\n\n\nObjective\nThe objective of this study was to explore and assess the public’s awareness and knowledge of IBD, as well as what relationship, if any, exists between the social stigma surrounding IBD, knowledge of the disease, and various media usage, including social media.\n\n\nMethods\nUtilizing a Web-based opt-in platform, we surveyed a nationally representative sample (n=1200) with demographics mirroring those of the US Census figures across baseline parameters.\n\n Using constructed indices based on factor analysis, we were able to build reliable measures of personal characteristics, media behaviors, and perceptions and knowledge of IBD.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the American public, IBD is the most stigmatized of seven diseases, including genital herpes and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).\n\n Additionally, IBD knowledge is generally low with 11.08% (133/1200) of the sample indicating no familiarity with the disease and 85.50% (1026/1200) of participants inaccurately answering two-thirds of the IBD index questions with which their knowledge was assessed.\n\n Increased knowledge of IBD is associated with lower levels of stigma.\n\n However, social media use is currently related to lower levels of IBD knowledge (P&lt;.\n\n05).\n\n Furthermore, findings indicate that participants who most frequently engaged in producing social media content are less knowledgeable about IBD (P&lt;.\n\n10), highlighting the potential for a dangerous cycle should they be contributing to a Web-based IBD dialogue.\n\n\nConclusions\nGreater efforts must be taken to stymie IBD misinformation across all media, but especially in social media channels, to increase IBD knowledge and reduce stigma surrounding IBD.\n\n These findings pave the way for further research qualitatively examining the pervasiveness of specific IBD messages found in today’s social media landscape and their impact on enacted stigmas so as to better equip providers and patient advocacy

for and Against Public Health Policy: Response to the Chicago Department of Public Health's Electronic Cigarette Twitter Campaign","abstract":"Background\nIn January 2014, the Chicago City Council scheduled a vote on local regulation of electronic cigarettes as tobacco products.\n\n One week prior to the vote, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) released a series of messages about electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) through its Twitter account.\n\n Shortly after the messages, or tweets, were released, the department’s Twitter account became the target of a “Twitter bomb” by Twitter users sending more than 600 tweets in one week against the proposed regulation.\n\n\nObjective\nThe purpose of our study was to examine the messages and tweet patterns in the social media response to the CDPH e-cigarette campaign.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected all tweets mentioning the CDPH in the week between the e-cigarette campaign and the vote on the new local e-cigarette policy.\n\n We conducted a content analysis of the tweets, used descriptive statistics to examine characteristics of involved Twitter users, and used network visualization and descriptive statistics to identify Twitter users prominent in the conversation.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 683 tweets mentioning CDPH during the week, 609 (89.2%) were anti-policy.\n\n More than half of anti-policy tweets were about use of electronic cigarettes for cessation as a healthier alternative to combustible cigarettes (358/609, 58.8%).\n\n Just over one-third of anti-policy tweets asserted that the health department was lying or disseminating propaganda (224/609, 36.8%).\n\n Approximately 14% (96/683, 14.1%) of the tweets used an account or included elements consistent with “astroturfing”—a strategy employed to promote a false sense of consensus around an idea.\n\n Few Twitter users were from the Chicago area; Twitter users from Chicago were significantly more likely than expected to tweet in support of the policy.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings may assist public health organizations to anticipate, recognize, and respond to coordinated social media campaigns.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4210950","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Prue","surname":"Talbot","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Prue","surname":"Talbot","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jenine

Article tone, source, topics, concerns, references, publication date, and interactive features were coded.\n\n The intercoder reliability had a total agreement of .\n\n90.\nResults\nResults indicate that 44.0% of the articles (88/200) about the HPV vaccination had a positive tone, 32.5% (65/200) maintained a neutral tone, while 23.5% (47/200) presented a negative tone.\n\n Protection against diseases 82.0% (164/200), vaccine eligibility for females 75.5% (151/200), and side effects 59.0% (118/200) were the top three topics covered by these articles.\n\n Google News and Twitter articles significantly differed in article tone, source, topics, concerns covered, types of sources referenced in the article, and uses of interactive features.\n\n Most notably, topic focus changed from public health information towards political conversation after Bachmann’s comment.\n\n Before the comment, the HPV vaccine news talked more often about vaccine dosing (P&lt;.\n\n001), duration (P=.\n\n005), vaccine eligibility for females (P=.\n\n03), and protection against diseases (P=.\n\n04) than did the later pieces.\n\n After the controversy, the news topic shifted towards politics (P=.\n\n01) and talked more about HPV vaccine eligibility for males (P=.\n\n01).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis longitudinal infodemiology study suggests that new media influences public health communication, knowledge transaction, and poses potential problems in the amount of misinformation disseminated during public health campaigns.\n\n In addition, the study calls for more research to adopt an infodemiology approach to explore relationships between online information supply and public health decisions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4869234","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicole","surname":"Liddon","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nicole","surname":"Liddon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wendy","surname":"Macias","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L

Anorexia on YouTube","abstract":"Introduction\nThe amount of information being uploaded onto social video platforms, such as YouTube, Vimeo, and Veoh, continues to spiral, making it increasingly difficult to discern reliable health information from misleading content.\n\n There are thousands of YouTube videos promoting misleading information about anorexia (eg, anorexia as a healthy lifestyle).\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to investigate anorexia-related misinformation disseminated through YouTube videos.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrieved YouTube videos related to anorexia using the keywords anorexia, anorexia nervosa, proana, and thinspo on October 10, 2011.Three doctors reviewed 140 videos with approximately 11 hours of video content, classifying them as informative, pro-anorexia, or others.\n\n By informative we mean content describing the health consequences of anorexia and advice on how to recover from it; by pro-anorexia we mean videos promoting anorexia as a fashion, a source of beauty, and that share tips and methods for becoming and remaining anorexic.\n\n The 40 most-viewed videos (20 informative and 20 pro-anorexia videos) were assessed to gauge viewer behavior.\n\n\nResults\nThe interrater agreement of classification was moderate (Fleiss’ kappa=0.5), with 29.3% (n=41) being rated as pro-anorexia, 55.7% (n=78) as informative, and 15.0% (n=21)

29.3% of anorexia-related videos.\n\n Pro-anorexia videos are less common than informative videos; however, in proportional terms, pro-anorexia content is more highly favored and rated by its viewers.\n\n Efforts should focus on raising awareness, particularly among teenagers, about the trustworthiness of online information about beauty and healthy lifestyles.\n\n Health authorities producing videos to combat anorexia should consider involving celebrities and models to reach a wider audience.\n\n More research is needed to study the characteristics of pro-anorexia videos in order to develop algorithms that will automatically detect and filter those videos before they become popular.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3636813","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Annie","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Annie","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alix","surname":"Timko","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shabbir","surname":"Syed-Abdul","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Shabbir","surname":"Syed-Abdul","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luis","surname":"Fernandez-Luque","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-Shan","surname":"Jian","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wen-Shan","surname":"Jian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Chuan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Steven","surname":"Crain","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min-Huei","surname":"Hsu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yao-Chin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dorjsuren","surname":"Khandregzen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Enkhzaya","surname":"Chuluunbaatar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Phung

Study on Immunization: Content Analysis","abstract":"Background\nMore people are searching for immunization information online and potentially being exposed to misinformation and antivaccination sentiment in content and discussions on social media platforms.\n\n As vaccination coverage rates remain suboptimal in several developed countries, and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases become more prevalent, it is important that we build on previous research by analyzing themes in online vaccination discussions, including those that individuals may see without actively searching for information on immunization.\n\n\nObjective\nThe study aimed to explore the sentiments and themes behind an unsolicited debate on immunization in order to better inform public health interventions countering antivaccination sentiment.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analyzed and quantified 117 user-driven open-ended comments on immunization posted in the Comments section of a Facebook advertisement that targeted Canadian parents for recruitment into a larger study on immunization.\n\n Then, 2 raters coded all comments using content analysis.\n\n\nResults\nOf 117 comments, 85 were posted by unique commentators, with most being female (65/85, 77%).\n\n The largest proportion of the immunization comments were positive (51/117, 43.6%), followed by negative (41/117, 35.0%), ambiguous (20/117, 17.1%), and hesitant (5/117, 4.3%).\n\n Inaccurate knowledge (27/130, 20.8%) and misperceptions of risk (23/130, 17.7%) were most prevalent in the 130 nonpositive comments.\n\n Other claims included distrust of pharmaceutical companies or government agencies (18/130, 13.8%), distrust of the health care system or providers (15/130, 11.5%), past negative experiences with vaccination or beliefs (10/130, 7.7%), and attitudes about health and prevention (10/130, 7.7%).\n\n Almost 40% (29/74, 39%) of the positive comments communicated the risks of not vaccinating, followed by judgments on the knowledge level of nonvaccinators (13/74, 18%).\n\n A total of 10 positive comments (10/74, 14%) specifically refuted the link between autism and vaccination.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe presence of more than 100 unsolicited user-driven comments on a platform not intended for discussion, nor providing any information on immunization, illustrates the strong sentiments associated with immunization and the arbitrariness of the online platforms used for immunization debates.\n\n Health authorities should be more proactive in finding mechanisms to refute misinformation and misperceptions that are propagating uncontested online.\n\n Online debates and communications on immunization need to be identified by continuous monitoring in order for health authorities to understand the current themes and trends, and to engage in the discussion.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6231725","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ana

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui
