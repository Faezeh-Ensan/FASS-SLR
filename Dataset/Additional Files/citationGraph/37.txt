coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaolin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xingwang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuelei","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangfa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongmeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Wang","email":"wangjw28@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"caobin_ben@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

Baseline and serial CXRs (total 255 CXRs) were reviewed along with RT-PCRs.\n\n Correlation with concurrent CTs (total 28 CTs) was made when available.\n\n Two radiologists scored each CXR in consensus for: consolidation, ground glass opacity (GGO), location and pleural fluid.\n\n A severity index was determined for each lung.\n\n The lung scores were summed to produce the final severity score.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 64 patients (26 men, mean age 56±19 years).\n\n Of these, 58, 44 and 38 patients had positive initial RT-PCR (91%, [CI: 81-96%]), abnormal baseline CXR (69%, [CI: 56-80%]) and positive initial RT-PCR with abnormal baseline CXR (59 [CI:46-71%]) respectively.\n\n Six patients (9%) showed CXR abnormalities before eventually testing positive on RT-PCR.\n\n Sensitivity of initial RT-PCR (91% [95% CI: 83-97%]) was higher than baseline CXR (69% [95% CI: 56-80%]) (p = 0.009).\n\n Radiographic (mean 6 ± 5 days) and virologic recovery (mean 8 ± 6 days) were not significantly different (p= 0.33).\n\n Consolidation was the most common finding (30/64, 47%), followed by GGO (21/64, 33%).\n\n CXR abnormalities had a peripheral (26/64, 41%) and lower zone distribution (32/64, 50%) with bilateral involvement (32/64, 50%).\n\n Pleural effusion was uncommon (2/64, 3%).\n\n The severity of CXR findings peaked at 10-12 days from the date of symptom onset.\n\n\nConclusion\nChest x-ray findings in COVID-19 patients frequently showed bilateral lower zone consolidation which peaked at 10-12 days from symptom

We also conducted a trial sequential analysis to indicate the possibility of type I or II errors and calculate the information size.\n Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE) was applying to assess the certainty of evidence at the primary outcome level.\n Results.\n Twenty-one RCTs were identified and analyzed.\n Patients treated with corticosteroid had a 7% reduction in relative risk in 28-day all-cause mortality compared to controls (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99).\n However, there were no significant differences for the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09) or in-hospital mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11).\n Corticosteroids shortened the length of ICU stay by 1.04 days (RR -1.04, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.36) and the length of hospital stay by 2.49 days (RR -2.49, 95% CI -4.96 to -0.02).\n Corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16) but not gastroduodenal bleeding (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.37) or superinfection (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.15).\n However, some date on secondary outcomes were unavailable because they were not measured or not reported in the included studies which may cause a lack of power or selective outcome reporting.\n The information size was calculated at 10044 patients.\n Trial sequential analysis showed that the meta-analysis was conclusive and the risk of type 2 error was minimal.\n What Is New and Conclusion.\n Corticosteroids are likely to be effective in reducing 28-day mortality and attenuating septic shock without increasing the rate of life-threatening complications.\n TSA showed that the risk of type II error in this meta-analysis was minimal and the result was conclusive.\n","id":"PMC6590573","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"X.-J.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.-Z.","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-S.","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-X.","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Z.-Z.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T.-H.","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.-C.","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-H.","surname":"Liu","email":"lyh0718@126.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajem.2018.11.040","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Can corticosteroids reduce the mortality of patients with severe sepsis?

However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment.\n We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups.\n We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample.\n The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher?order moments, and interactions.\n The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated

clinical presentation, gene expression signatures that predict subsequent severity will allow clinicians to identify the most at-risk groups of patients and enable appropriate antibiotic use.\n\n\nMethods\nBlood RNA-Seq and clinical data were collected from 348 patients in four emergency rooms (ER) and one intensive-care-unit (ICU), and 44 healthy controls.\n\n Gene expression profiles were analyzed using machine learning and data mining to identify clinically relevant gene signatures reflecting disease severity, organ dysfunction, mortality, and specific endotypes/mechanisms.\n\n\nFindings\nGene expression signatures were obtained that predicted severity/organ dysfunction and mortality in both ER and ICU patients with accuracy/AUC of 77–80%.\n\n Network analysis revealed these signatures formed a coherent biological program, with specific but overlapping mechanisms/pathways.\n\n Given the heterogeneity of sepsis, we asked if patients could be assorted into discrete groups with distinct mechanisms (endotypes) and varying severity.\n\n Patients with early sepsis could be stratified into five distinct and novel mechanistic endotypes, named Neutrophilic-Suppressive/NPS, Inflammatory/INF, Innate-Host-Defense/IHD, Interferon/IFN, and Adaptive/ADA, each based on ?200 unique gene expression differences, and distinct pathways/mechanisms (e.\n\ng.\n\n, IL6/STAT3 in NPS).\n\n Endotypes had varying overall severity with two severe (NPS/INF) and one relatively benign (ADA) groupings, consistent with reanalysis of previous endotype studies.\n\n A 40 gene-classification tool (accuracy=96%) and several gene-pairs (accuracy=89–97%) accurately predicted endotype status in both ER and ICU validation cohorts.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe severity and endotype signatures indicate that distinct immune signatures precede the onset of severe sepsis and lethality, providing a method to triage early sepsis patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8808161","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Arjun","surname":"Baghela","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olga

clinical syndrome defined by the presence of infection and systemic inflammatory response to infection and results from a complex interaction between the host and infectious agents.\n It is characterized by the activation of multiple inflammatory pathways, with an increased risk of mortality.\n The incidence of sepsis has been on an ever-increasing pathway in recent years.\n Sepsis can be induced by several clinical situations that predispose to its occurrence: malignant tumors, organ transplantation, AIDS, radiation therapy, burns, sores, polytrauma, diabetes mellitus, hepatic failure, renal failure, malnutrition, catheters or different invasive devices, and urinary catheters.\n The microorganisms involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis are Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococci, Streptococci) and Gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E.\n coli), fungi (Candida), parasites, and viruses.\n Among mechanisms involved in septic shock production, two pathological phenomena appear: the profound decompensation of circulation and metabolic disturbances that evolve towards an irreversible state.\n The intimate mechanism of shock involves the activation of monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils by lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria.\n The microvascular bed is directly involved in the etiopathogenesis of disorders of acute inflammatory states associated with or without sepsis.\n A better comprehension of sepsis pathophysiology, especially the molecular mechanisms of septic shock, allows for new therapeutic

that GSDMD deficiency paradoxically augmented host responses to extracellular Escherichia coli, mainly by delaying neutrophil death, which established GSDMD as a negative regulator of innate immunity.\n In contrast to its activation in macrophages, in which activated inflammatory caspases cleave GSDMD to produce an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-cNT) to trigger pyroptosis, GSDMD cleavage and activation in neutrophils was caspase independent.\n It was mediated by a neutrophil-specific serine protease, neutrophil elastase (ELANE), released from cytoplasmic granules into the cytosol in aging neutrophils.\n ELANE-mediated GSDMD cleavage was upstream of the caspase cleavage site and produced a fully active ELANE-derived NT fragment (GSDMD-eNT) that induced lytic cell death as efficiently as GSDMD-cNT.\n Thus, GSDMD is pleiotropic, exerting both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects that make it a potential target for antibacterial and anti-inflammatory

analysis","abstract":"Background\nCorrelation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications.\n\n For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples.\n\n Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures.\n\n Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets.\n\n These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.\n\ng.\n\n cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data.\n\n While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.\n\n\nResults\nThe WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis.\n\n The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software.\n\n Along with the

translated into daily clinical practice in septic shock patients.\n\n Perfusion markers are surrogates of deeper physiological phenomena.\n\n Lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (LPR) and the ratio between veno-arterial PCO2 difference and Ca–vO2 (?PCO2/Ca–vO2) have been proposed as markers of tissue hypoxia, but they have not been compared in the clinical scenario.\n\n We studied acute septic shock patients under resuscitation.\n\n We wanted to evaluate the relationship of these hypoxia markers with clinical and biochemical markers of hypoperfusion during septic shock resuscitation.\n\n\nMethods\nSecondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.\n\n Septic shock patients were randomized to fluid resuscitation directed to normalization of capillary refill time (CRT) versus normalization or significant lowering of lactate.\n\n Multimodal assessment of perfusion was performed at 0, 2, 6 and 24 hours, and included macrohemodynamic and metabolic perfusion variables, CRT, regional flow and hypoxia markers.\n\n Patients who attained their pre-specified endpoint at 2-hours were compared to those who did not.\n\n\nResults\nForty-two patients were recruited, median APACHE-II score was 23 [15–31] and 28-day mortality 23%.\n\n LPR and ?PCO2/Ca–vO2 ratio did not correlate during early resuscitation (0–2 h) and the whole study period

patients.\n\n If the NLR was ?15 on the 3rd day, the mortality odds ratio was 6.96 (CI: 1.4–34.1, P &lt; 0.017).\n\n The NLR and CRP on the 1st, 3rd, and last day of ICU stay (0.52, 0.58, 0.78 and 0.56, 0.70, 0.78, respectively) showed a similar increasing trend for mortality.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR can predict mortality and antibiotic responsiveness in ICU patients with sepsis and septic shock.\n\n If the NLR is &gt;15 on the 3rd day of postantibiotic initiation, the risk of mortality is high and treatment should be reviewed carefully.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7018205","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rabia","surname":"SARI","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zuhal","surname":"KARAKURT","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zuhal","surname":"KARAKURT","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mustafa","surname":"AY","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Mustafa","surname":"AY","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Muhammed

Among these associations, protein–protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability.\n The STRING database aims to integrate all known and

automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another.\n STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms.\n In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks.\n In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities

with high mortality rate in intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of sepsis, and its occurrence is a poor prognostic sign to septic patients.\n\n We analyzed co-differentially expressed genes (co-DEGs) to explore relationships between septic shock and AKI and reveal potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of septic-shock-associated AKI (SSAKI).\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Two gene expression datasets (GSE30718 and GSE57065) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).\n\n The GSE57065 dataset included 28 septic shock patients and 25 healthy volunteers and blood samples were collected within 0.5, 24 and 48?h after shock.\n\n Specimens of GSE30718 were collected from 26 patients with AKI and 11 control patents.\n\n AKI-DEGs and septic-shock-DEGs were identified using the two datasets.\n\n Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed to elucidate molecular mechanisms of DEGs.\n\n We also evaluated co-DEGs and corresponding predicted miRNAs involved in septic shock and AKI.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>We identified 62 DEGs in AKI specimens and 888, 870, and 717 DEGs in septic shock blood samples within 0.5, 24 and 48?h, respectively.\n\n The hub genes of EGF and OLFM4 may be involved in AKI and QPCT, CKAP4, PRKCQ, PLAC8, PRC1, BCL9L, ATP11B, KLHL2, LDLRAP1, NDUFAF1, IFIT2, CSF1R, HGF, NRN1, GZMB, and STAT4 may be associated with septic shock.\n\n Besides, co-DEGs of VMP1, SLPI, PTX3, TIMP1, OLFM4, LCN2, and S100A9 coupled with corresponding predicted miRNAs, especially miR-29b-3p, miR-152-3p, and miR-223-3p may be regarded as promising targets for the

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

(COVID-19) (formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than 2000 deaths worldwide.\n Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern.\n The COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia.\n Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible.\n The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement.\n Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases.\n Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China.\n Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","id":"PMC7128959","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chih-Cheng","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yen Hung","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cheng-Yi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ya-Hui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shun-Chung","surname":"Hsueh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Muh-Yen","surname":"Yen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wen-Chien","surname":"Ko","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Po-Ren","surname":"Hsueh","email":"hsporen@ntu.edu.tw","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WHO. https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200221-sitrep-32-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn&amp;equals;4802d089_2.

cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),

syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020.

Features Predicting Mortality Risk in Patients With Viral Pneumonia: The MuLBSTA Score","abstract":"Objective\nThe aim of this study was to further clarify clinical characteristics and predict mortality risk among patients with viral pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 528 patients with viral pneumonia at RuiJin hospital in Shanghai from May 2015 to May 2019 were recruited.\n\n Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was used to detect respiratory viruses.\n\n Demographic information, comorbidities, routine laboratory examinations, immunological indexes, etiological detections, radiological images and treatment were collected on admission.\n\n\nResults\n76 (14.4%) patients died within 90 days in hospital.\n\n A predictive MuLBSTA score was calculated on the basis of a multivariate logistic regression model in order to predict mortality with a weighted score that included multilobular infiltrates (OR = 5.20, 95% CI 1.41–12.52, p = 0.010; 5 points), lymphocyte ? 0.8?109/L (OR = 4.53, 95% CI 2.55–8.05, p &lt; 0.001; 4 points), bacterial coinfection (OR = 3.71, 95% CI 2.11–6.51, p &lt; 0.001; 4 points), acute-smoker (OR = 3.19, 95% CI 1.34–6.26, p = 0.001; 3 points), quit-smoker (OR = 2.18, 95% CI 0.99–4.82, p = 0.054; 2 points), hypertension (OR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.55–4.26, p = 0.003; 2 points) and age ?60 years (OR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.04–4.39, p = 0.038; 2 points).\n\n 12 points was used as a cut-off value for mortality risk stratification.\n\n This model showed sensitivity of 0.776, specificity of 0.778 and a better predictive ability than CURB-65 (AUROC = 0.773 vs.\n\n 0.717, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nHere, we designed an easy-to-use clinically predictive tool for assessing 90-day mortality risk of viral pneumonia.\n\n It can accurately stratify hospitalized patients with viral pneumonia into relevant risk categories and could provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6901688","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lingxi","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinxin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yurong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qingyun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jieming","surname":"Qu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"2019-nCoV

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

outcomes of current medical approaches for Middle East respiratory syndrome: A systematic review and meta?analysis","abstract":"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory disease caused by MERS coronavirus.\n Because of lack of vaccination, various studies investigated the therapeutic efficacy of antiviral drugs and supportive remedies.\n A systematic literature search from 10 databases was conducted and screened for relevant articles.\n Studies reporting information about the treatment of MERS coronavirus infection were extracted and analyzed.\n Despite receiving treatment with ribavirin plus IFN, the case fatality rate was as high as 71% in the IFN?treatment group and exactly the same in patients who received supportive treatment only.\n Having chronic renal disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension increased the risk of mortality (P &lt; .\n05), and chronic renal disease is the best parameter to predict the mortality.\n The mean of survival days from onset of illness to death was 46.6 (95% CI, 30.5?62.6) for the IFN group compared with 18.8 (95% CI, 10.3?27.4) for the supportive?only group (P = .\n001).\n Delay in starting treatment, older age group, and preexisting comorbidities are associated with worse outcomes.\n In conclusion, there is no difference between IFN treatment and supportive treatment for MERS patients in terms of mortality.\n However, ribavirin and IFN combination might have efficacious effects with timely administration and monitoring of adverse events.\n Large?scale prospective randomized studies are required to assess the role

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),

rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

hence it has risen many questions yet to be clarified.\n\n The aim of this study was to outline the main issues that led tobacco smoking being discussed as a potential risk factor associated with COVID-19.\nMethods:\narticles from MEDLINE and pre-prints published from January to April 2020 were identified.\n\n\nResults:\ndata from China showed that men had more severe outcomes of COVID-19 than women.\n\n Since smoking prevalence is very high among Chinese men in comparison to women, it was hypothesized that smoking could be a risk factor for poor prognosis.\n\n This was also supported by the higher prevalence of comorbidities, many of which tobacco-related diseases, in patients with severe COVID-19, who were also more likely to have a smoking history.\n\n A meta-analysis confirmed these results, reporting an OR=2.25 (95% CI: 1.49-3.39) for developing severe COVID-19 among patients with a smoking history.\n\n Some authors, noticing that reported smoking prevalence among hospitalized patients was substantially lower than smoking prevalence in the source populations, speculated a protective role of nicotine.\n\n However, it is likely that low prevalence among hospitalized patients are partially due to many smokers misclassified as nonsmokers.\n\n Tobacco smoking seems to cause a dose-dependent upregulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2), the virus cellular entry receptor, which could explain the higher risk of severe COVID-19 in smokers.\n\n\nConclusions:\nThere is need for further independent studies to clarify the role of smoking on COVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.\n\n (www.\n\nactabiomedica.\n\nit)\n","id":"PMC7569632","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria Sofia","surname":"Cattaruzza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincenzo","surname":"Zagà","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Silvano","surname":"Gallus","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"D’Argenio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Gorini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Characteristics of and Important Lessons From the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China: Summary of a Report of 72 314 Cases From the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of 140 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 Does Not Lead to a &quot;Typical&quot;

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study.\n A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID?19 were enrolled.\n The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36?55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men).\n The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area.\n Forty?three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]).\n Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]).\n Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients.\n All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]).\n In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]).\n It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines.\n Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d?dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C?reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase.\n This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID?19 patients.\n Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia.\n Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID?19.","id":"PMC7228368","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Suxin","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Zheng","email":"yuzheng1@cdutcm.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Boqun","surname":"Li","email":"279685211@qq.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Boqun","surname":"Li","email":"279685211@qq.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanjun","surname":"Hu","email":"huyanjun@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chunhui","surname":"Lang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daoqiu","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qiuyan","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xia","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jinglong","surname":"Lv","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yaling","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haoran","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gu","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruishan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s13054-020-2833-7","date":"2020-03-13","title":"Host

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

Clinical information and laboratory findings, including IL-6 levels, were collected approximately 3 and 9 days after admission to be matched with preadministration and postadministration of TCZ.\n\n Multivariable logistic and linear regressions and survival analysis were performed depending on outcomes: need for IMV, evolution of arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, or mortality.\n\n\nResults\nOne hundred forty-six patients were studied, predominantly males (66%); median age was 63 years.\n\n Forty-four patients (30%) required IMV, and 58 patients (40%) received treatment with TCZ.\n\n IL-6 levels greater than 30 pg/mL was the best predictor for IMV (odds ratio, 7.1; P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n Early administration of TCZ was associated with improvement in oxygenation (arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio) in patients with high IL-6 (P = .\n\n048).\n\n Patients with high IL-6 not treated with TCZ showed high mortality (hazard ratio, 4.6; P = .\n\n003), as well as those with low IL-6 treated with TCZ (hazard ratio, 3.6; P = .\n\n016).\n\n No relevant serious adverse events were observed in TCZ-treated patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nBaseline IL-6 greater than 30 pg/mL predicts IMV requirement in patients with COVID-19 and contributes to establish an adequate indication for TCZ administration.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7525244","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"José

inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care.\n\n Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P&lt;0.001).\n\n The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization.\n\n In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs.\n\n 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs.\n\n 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs.\n\n 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.\n\n (Funded by the Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health Research and others; RECOVERY ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov number, NCT04381936;

COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge.\n\n Biomarkers have always played an important role in clinical decision making in various infectious diseases.\n\n It is crucial to assess the role of biomarkers in evaluating severity of disease and appropriate allocation of resources.\n\n\nDesign and setting\nSystematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n English full text observational studies describing the laboratory findings and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalised patients were identified searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, medRxiv using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV from 1 December 2019 to 15 August 2020 following Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.\n\n\nParticipants\nStudies having biomarkers, including lymphocyte, platelets, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, procalcitonin (PCT) and creatine kinase (CK), and describing outcomes were selected with the consensus of three independent reviewers.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nComposite poor outcomes include intensive care unit admission, oxygen saturation &lt;90%, invasive mechanical ventilation utilisation, severe disease, in-hospital admission and mortality.\n\n The OR and 95%?CI were obtained and forest plots were created using random-effects models.\n\n Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed by sensitivity analysis.\n\n\nResults\n32 studies with 10?491 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included.\n\n We found that lymphopenia (pooled-OR: 3.33 (95% CI: 2.51–4.41); p&lt;0.00001), thrombocytopenia (2.36 (1.64–3.40); p&lt;0.00001), elevated D-dimer (3.39 (2.66–4.33); p&lt;0.00001), elevated CRP (4.37

diseases may increase the risk of transmission.\n\n A fast and convenient differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and influenza has significant clinical value, especially for low- and middle-income countries with a shortage of nucleic acid detection kits.\n\n We aimed to establish a diagnostic model to differentiate COVID-19 and influenza based on clinical data.\n\n\nMaterial/Methods\nA total of 493 patients were enrolled in the study, including 282 with COVID-19 and 211 with influenza.\n\n All data were collected and reviewed retrospectively.\n\n The clinical and laboratory characteristics of all patients were analyzed and compared.\n\n We then randomly divided all patients into development sets and validation sets to establish a diagnostic model using multivariate logistic regression analysis.\n\n Finally, we validated the diagnostic model using the validation set.\n\n\nResults\nWe preliminarily established a diagnostic model for differentiating COVID-19 from influenza that consisted of 5 variables: age, dry cough, fever, white cell count, and D-dimer.\n\n The model showed good performance for differential diagnosis.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis initial model including clinical features and laboratory indices effectively differentiated COVID-19 from influenza.\n\n Patients with a high score were at a high risk of having COVID-19, while patients with a low score were at a high risk of having influenza.\n\n This model could help clinicians quickly identify and isolate cases in the absence of nucleic acid tests, especially during the cocirculation of COVID-19 and

rapidly, and may lead to severe heart failure or circulatory failure presenting as rapid-onset hypotension and cardiogenic shock, with mortality rates as high as 50%–70%.\n Most importantly, there are no treatment options, guidelines or an expert consensus statement.\n Here, we provide the first expert consensus, the Chinese Society of Cardiology Expert Consensus Statement on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Fulminant Myocarditis, based on data from our recent clinical trial (NCT03268642).\n In this statement, we describe the clinical features and diagnostic criteria of fulminant myocarditis, and importantly, for the first time, we describe a new treatment regimen termed life support-based comprehensive treatment regimen.\n The core content of this treatment regimen includes (i) mechanical life support (applications of mechanical respirators and circulatory support systems, including intraaortic balloon pump and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, (ii) immunological modulation by using sufficient doses of glucocorticoid, immunoglobulin and (iii) antiviral reagents using neuraminidase inhibitor.\n The proper application of this treatment regimen may and has helped to save the lives

venoarterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) support is effective in patients with cardiogenic shock or fatal arrhythmia due to fulminant myocarditis.\n\n The clinical courses of fulminant myocarditis are still uncertain; therefore, it is difficult to determine the appropriate time for discontinuing ECMO or converting to a ventricular assist device.\n\n The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognosis of patients with fulminant myocarditis managed by ECMO.\n\n\nMethods\nTwenty-two consecutive patients with fulminant myocarditis managed by peripheral venoarterial ECMO between 1999 and 2013 were enrolled.\n\n\nResults\nSurvival to discharge was 59% (13 patients), and in-hospital mortality was 41% (9 patients).\n\n The age in the survivor group was significantly lower than that in the non-survivor group (survivor group vs.\n\n non-survivor group; 36.5?±?4.1 vs.\n\n 60.2?±?5.0 years, p?=?0.001).\n\n Although the ECMO support duration was similar between the groups (181?±?22 vs.\n\n 177?±?31 h), the rate of complication related to ECMO was significantly lower in the survivor group (15.3% vs.\n\n 66.6%, p?=?0.02).\n\n When comparing the

direct: 2.2?±?0.5 vs.\n\n 9.8?±?4.5 mg/dL, p?=?0.009).\n\n\nConclusions\nFulminant myocarditis is associated with high mortality rates despite ECMO.\n\n An older age and complications related to ECMO

(CK), C-reactive protein (CRP), and QRS width increased significantly between days 1 and 3 of treatment; the patient’s hemodynamic profile deteriorated despite this treatment regimen.\n\n Intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated on day 3 at a dose of 1,000 mg/day and maintained for an additional three days.\n\n Less than 24 h after methylprednisolone administration, the QRS width decreased significantly from 0.44 s to 0.18 s.\n\n In addition, CK and CRP levels declined sharply, which is associated with hemodynamic improvement.\n\n\nConclusions:\nHigh doses of intravenous methylprednisolone may be considered a therapeutic option for patients with fulminant myocarditis that is refractory to usual management practices.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3700499","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hiroshi","surname":"Nakashima","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yasuhiro","surname":"Umeyama","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kazutoshi","surname":"Minami","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/eurheartj/ehs332","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Liver

whether intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was able to improve left ventricular function and reduce the episodes of arrhythmia in adult patients with AFM.\n The medical records of all patients with AFM who were admitted to the Critical Care Unit of Guangdong General Hospital (Guangzhou, China) between January 2001 and December 2010 were reviewed.\n A cohort of 58 patients was included in the study.\n Of these 58, 32 patients were treated with IVIG (400 mg/kg per day) for five days, while the remaining patients did not receive IVIG therapy.\n The patients who received IVIG therapy had a higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and a reduced left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDD) compared with the non-IVIG therapy patients four weeks subsequent to the treatment (PLVEF=0.011 and PLVDD=0.048).\n The post-treatment incidence of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) and atrioventricular block (AVB) was reduced in the patients who received IVIG therapy compared with the baseline values (PVT/VF=0.025, PAVB=0.003); however, no significant differences were observed in the non-IVIG therapy patients (PVT/VF=0.564, PAVB=0.083) following treatment.\n There were two mortalities in the IVIG therapy group and seven in the non-IVIG therapy group (P=0.072).\n This retrospective study suggested that the use of IVIG for the treatment of AFM may be associated with improved left ventricular function and reduced episodes of fulminant

with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

rapidly spread throughout China.\n\n This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1st to February 5th.\n\n The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P&lt;0.05).\n\n Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P&lt;0.05).\n\n After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission,

believed to be an innocuous condition, has now become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in many countries worldwide.\n NAFLD is already highly prevalent in the general population, and owing to a rising incidence of obesity and diabetes mellitus, the incidence of NAFLD and its impact on global healthcare are expected to increase in the future.\n A subset of patients with NAFLD develops progressive liver disease leading to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure.\n NAFLD has emerged as one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in recent years.\n Moreover, HCC can occur in NAFLD even in absence of cirrhosis.\n Compared with the general population, NAFLD increases the risk of liver-related, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.\n NAFLD is bidirectionally associated with metabolic syndrome.\n NAFLD increases the risk and contributes to aggravation of the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease.\n In addition, NAFLD is linked to colorectal polyps, polycystic ovarian syndrome, osteoporosis, obstructive sleep apnea, stroke, and various extrahepatic malignancies.\n Extended resection of steatotic liver is associated with increased risk of liver failure and mortality.\n There is an increasing trend of NAFLD-related cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation, and the recurrence of NAFLD in such patients is almost universal.\n This review discusses the growing burden of NAFLD, its outcomes, and adverse associations with various

worldwide, notably in Europe and North America where obesity is highly prevalent.\n\n The relation between obesity and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus?2 (SARS?CoV?2) has not been fully documented.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective cohort study analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, including BMI, and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for SARS?CoV?2 in a single French center.\n\n\nResults\nObesity (BMI?&gt;?30) and severe obesity (BMI?&gt;?35) were present in 47.6% and 28.2% of cases, respectively.\n\n Overall, 85 patients (68.6%) required IMV.\n\n The proportion of patients who required IMV increased with BMI categories (P?&lt;?0.01, ?2 test for trend), and it was greatest in patients with BMI?&gt;?35 (85.7%).\n\n In multivariate logistic regression, the need for IMV was significantly associated with male sex (P?&lt;?0.05) and BMI (P?&lt;?0.05), independent of age,

safety outcomes of lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir–interferon (IFN)-?-1a, hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir in comparison to standard of care (control) in coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) inpatients requiring oxygen and/or ventilatory support.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a phase III multicentre, open-label, randomized 1:1:1:1:1, adaptive, controlled trial (DisCoVeRy), an add-on to the Solidarity trial (NCT04315948, EudraCT2020-000936-23).\n\n The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15, measured by the WHO seven-point ordinal scale.\n\n Secondary outcomes included quantification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory specimens and pharmacokinetic and safety analyses.\n\n We report the results for the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms and for the hydroxychloroquine arm, trials of which were stopped prematurely.\n\n\nResults\nThe intention-to-treat population included 583 participants—lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 145), lopinavir/ritonavir–IFN–?-1a (n = 145), hydroxychloroquine (n = 145), control (n = 148)—among whom 418 (71.7%) were male, the median age was 63 years (IQR 54–71), and 211 (36.2%) had a severe disease.\n\n The day-15 clinical status was not improved with the investigational treatments: lopinavir/ritonavir versus control, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.83, (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55–1.26, p 0.39), lopinavir/ritonavir–IFN–?-1a versus control, aOR 0.69 (95%CI 0.45–1.04, p 0.08), and hydroxychloroquine versus control, aOR 0.93 (95%CI 0.62–1.41, p 0.75).\n\n No significant effect of investigational treatment was observed on SARS-CoV-2 clearance.\n\n Trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir were higher than those expected, while those of hydroxychloroquine were those expected with the dosing regimen.\n\n The occurrence of serious adverse events was significantly higher in participants allocated to the

type I interferon activity and inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients","abstract":"Interferons (IFNs) are central to antiviral immunity.\n Viral recognition elicits IFN production, which in turn triggers the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which engage in various antiviral functions.\n Type I IFNs (IFN-? and IFN-?) are widely expressed and can result in immunopathology during viral infections.\n By contrast, type III IFN (IFN-?) responses are primarily restricted to mucosal surfaces and are thought to confer antiviral protection without driving damaging proinflammatory responses.\n Accordingly, IFN-? has been proposed as a therapeutic in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other such viral respiratory diseases (see the Perspective by Grajales-Reyes and Colonna).\n Broggi et al.\n report that COVID-19 patient morbidity correlates with the high expression of type I and III IFNs in the lung.\n Furthermore, IFN-? secreted by dendritic cells in the lungs of mice exposed to synthetic viral RNA causes damage to the lung epithelium, which increases susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections.\n Similarly, using a mouse model of influenza infection, Major et al.\n found that IFN signaling (especially IFN-?) hampers lung repair by inducing p53 and inhibiting epithelial proliferation and differentiation.\n Complicating this picture, Hadjadj et al.\n observed that peripheral blood immune cells from severe and critical COVID-19 patients have diminished type I IFN and enhanced proinflammatory interleukin-6– and tumor necrosis factor-?–fueled responses.\n This suggests that in contrast to local production, systemic production of IFNs may be beneficial.\n The results of this trio of studies suggest that the location, timing, and duration of IFN exposure are critical parameters underlying the success or failure of therapeutics for viral respiratory

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Extraordinary

This analysis aimed to explore risk factors for mortality of severe COVID-19, and establish a scoring system to predict in-hospital deaths.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed and clinical characteristics were compared.\n\n LASSO regression as well as multivariable analysis were used to screen variables and establish prediction model.\n\n\nFindings\nA total of 2529 patients with COVID-19 was retrospectively analyzed, and 452 eligible severe COVID-19 were used for finally analysis.\n\n In training cohort, the median age was 66•0 years while it was 73•0 years in non-survivors.\n\n Patients aged 60–75 years accounted for the largest proportion of infected populations and mortality toll.\n\n Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were monitored up to 54 days, and IgG levels reached the highest during 20–30 days.\n\n No differences were observed of antibody levels between severe and non-severe patients.\n\n About 60.2% of severe patients had complications.\n\n Among acute myocardial injury (AMI), acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute liver injury (ALI), the heart was the earliest injured organ, whereas the time from AKI to death was the shortest.\n\n Age, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%), procalcitonin (PCT), serum urea, C reactive protein and D-dimer (DD), were identified associated with mortality by LASSO binary logistic regression.\n\n Then multivariable analysis was performed to conclude that old age, CHD, LYM%, PCT and DD remained independent risk factors for mortality.\n\n Based on the above variables, a scoring system of COVID-19 (CSS) was established to divide patients into low-risk and high-risk groups.\n\n This model displayed good discrimination (AUC=0·919) and calibration (P=0·264).\n\n Complications in low-risk and high-risk groups were significantly different (P&lt;0·05).\n\n Use of corticosteroids in low-risk groups increased hospital stays by 4·5 days (P=0·036) and durations of disease by 7·5 days (P=0·012) compared with no corticosteroids.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOld age, CHD, LYM%, PCT and DD were independently related to mortality.\n\n CSS was useful for predicting in-hospital mortality and complications, and it could help clinicians to identify high-risk patients with poor prognosis.\n\n\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Key Project for Anti-2019 novel Coronavirus Pneumonia from the Ministry of Science and Technology, China (grant number 2020YFC0845500).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7332889","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yufeng","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Yongchang","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jingfeng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Liang","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Minghui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yongxi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Zhigang","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Haibo","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Fuling","surname":"Zhou","email":"zhoufuling@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"                            Xinghuan","surname":"Wang","email":"wangxinghuan@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"4"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Influenza","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Norovirus classification and proposed strain nomenclature","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Wu, A. et al.

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak.\n The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV.\n Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus.\n Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV.\n In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients.\n

A first step in understanding SARS pathogenesis","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route.\n A distinct coronavirus (SARS?CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS.\n Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004

associated with in-hospital death of patients with COVID-19","abstract":"In December 2019, a coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease outbreak occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread to other areas worldwide.\n Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure were the main features, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored.\n Since information on kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 is limited, we determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19. Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital that also encompassed three affiliates following this major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020 of whom 113 (16.1%) died in hospital.\n Median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range, 50-71), including 367 men and 334 women.\n On admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria.\n The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively.\n During the study period, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients.\n Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death.\n Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1+ (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2+?3+ (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1+ (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2+?3+ (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count.\n Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality.\n Hence, clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe COVID-19.","id":"PMC7110296","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yichun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ran","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhixiang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junhua","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Yao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuwang","surname":"Ge","email":"geshuwang@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Xu","email":"xugang@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Predictors

the early stages, when few data were available.\n\n Now that the outbreak has ended, albeit unofficially, a more comprehensive review is appropriate.\n\n\nMethods\nData were obtained through the MERS portal by the Ministry for Health and Welfare (MOHW) and Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, press releases by MOHW, and reports by the MERS Policy Committee of the Korean Medical Association.\n\n Cases were analysed for general characteristics, exposure source, timeline and infection generation.\n\n Sex, age and underlying diseases were analysed for the 38 deaths.\n\n\nFindings\nBeginning with the index case that infected 28 others, an in-depth analysis was conducted.\n\n The average age was 55 years, which was a little higher than the global average of 50 years.\n\n As in most other countries, more men than women were affected.\n\n The case fatality rate was 19.9%, which was lower than the global rate of 38.7% and the rate in Saudi Arabia (36.5%).\n\n In total, 184 patients were infected nosocomially and there were no community-acquired infections.\n\n The main underlying diseases were respiratory diseases, cancer and hypertension.\n\n The main contributors to the outbreak were late diagnosis, quarantine failure of ‘super spreaders’, familial care-giving and visiting, non-disclosure by patients, poor communication by the South Korean Government, inadequate hospital infection management, and ‘doctor shopping’.\n\n The outbreak was entirely nosocomial, and was largely attributable to infection management and policy failures, rather than biomedical factors.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7114867","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"K.H.","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"T.E.","surname":"Tandi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.W.","surname":"Choi","email":"shine@korea.ac.kr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.M.","surname":"Moon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"M.S.","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3947/ic.2016.48.2.118","date":"2016-06-25","title":"Clinical Presentation and Outcomes of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Republic of Korea","abstract":"Background\nFrom May to July 2015, the Republic of Korea experienced the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outside the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n A total of 186 patients, including 36 deaths, had been diagnosed with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection as of September 30th, 2015.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe obtained information of patients who were confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 16 to 86).\n\n A total of 55.4% of the patients had one or more coexisting medical conditions.\n\n The most common symptom was fever (95.2%).\n\n At admission, leukopenia (42.6%), thrombocytopenia (46.6%), and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (42.7%) were observed.\n\n Pneumonia was detected in 68.3% of patients at admission and developed in 80.8% during the disease course.\n\n Antiviral agents were used for 74.7% of patients.\n\n Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and convalescent serum were employed for 24.5%, 7.1%, and 3.8% of patients, respectively.\n\n Older age, presence of coexisting medical conditions including diabetes or chronic lung disease, presence of dyspnea, hypotension, and leukocytosis at admission, and the use of mechanical ventilation were revealed to be independent predictors of death.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe clinical features of MERS-CoV infection in the Republic of Korea were similar to those of previous outbreaks in the Middle East.\n\n However, the overall mortality rate (20.4%) was lower than that in previous reports.\n\n Enhanced surveillance and active management of patients during the outbreak may have resulted in improved outcomes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4945721","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Won

condition and fatal cases, compared to recovered or asymptomatic cases were more likely to have an underlying condition (86.8% vs.\n 42.4%, p&lt;0.001).\n Analysis of genetic sequence data suggests multiple independent introductions into human populations and modelled estimates using epidemiologic and genetic data suggest R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;1, though the upper range of estimates may exceed 1. Index/sporadic cases (cases with no epidemiologic-link to other cases) were more likely to be older (median 59.0 years vs.\n 43.0 years, p&lt;0.001) compared to secondary cases, although these proportions have declined over time.\n 80.9% vs.\n 67.2% of index/sporadic and secondary cases, respectively, reported ?1 underlying condition.\n Clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure.\n Nearly all symptomatic patients presented with respiratory symptoms and 1/3 of patients also had gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nConclusions: Sustained human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has not been observed.\n Outbreaks have been extinguished without overly aggressive isolation and quarantine suggesting that transmission of virus may be stopped with implementation of appropriate infection control measures.\n \n","id":"PMC3828229","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mohammad Mousa","surname":"Abdallat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fekri","surname":"Abroug","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Said Hamed","surname":"Al-Dhahry","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohammed M.","surname":"Al-Hajri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rafat","surname":"Al-Hakeem","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Farida Ismail","surname":"AlHosani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sultan Mohammed Abdalla","surname":"Al Qasrawi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hamad Eid","surname":"Al-Romaihi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abdullah","surname":"Assiri","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J Kenneth","surname":"Baillie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter Karim Ben","surname":"Embarek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Afif Ben","surname":"Salah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benjamin","surname":"Blümel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Briese","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Udo","surname":"Buchholz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sebastien Bruno Francois","surname":"Cognat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabriel N.","surname":"Defang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stéphane","surname":"De La Rocque","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Isabella","surname":"Donatelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick A.","surname":"Drury","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sergey R.","surname":"Eremin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Neil M.","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Arnaud","surname":"Fontanet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierre B.H.","surname":"Formenty","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ron A.M.","surname":"Fouchier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christine Q","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erika","surname":"Garcia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Gerber","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benoît","surname":"Guery","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bart L.","surname":"Haagmans","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Aktham Jeries","surname":"Haddadin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maxwell C.","surname":"Hardiman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lisa E.","surname":"Hensley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stéphane","surname":"Hugonnet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David SC","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Isla","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"William","surname":"Karesh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marion","surname":"Koopmans","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Kuehne","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"W.

novel coronavirus (CoV).\n\n Clinical data on MERS-CoV infections are scarce.\n\n We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of MERS-CoV infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities.\n\n\nMethods\nWe abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated MERS-CoV infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n\nFindings\n47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77%) were male (male:female ratio 3·3:1).\n\n 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate.\n\n The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age.\n\n Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96%]) had underlying comorbid medical disorders, including diabetes (32 [68%]), hypertension (16 [34%]), chronic cardiac disease (13 [28%]), and chronic renal disease (23 [49%]).\n\n Common symptoms at presentation were fever (46 [98%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87%]), cough (39 [83%]), shortness of breath (34 [72%]), and myalgia (15 [32%]).\n\n Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea (12 [26%]), vomiting (ten [21%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17%]).\n\n All patients had abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities.\n\n Laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven [15%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34%]).\n\n\nInterpretation\nDisease caused by MERS-CoV presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical comorbidities.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, community prevalence, and clinical spectrum of infection and disease need urgent

deaths.\n\n\nFindings\nBeginning with the index case that infected 28 others, an in-depth analysis was conducted.\n\n The average age was 55 years, which was a little higher than the global average of 50 years.\n\n As in most other countries, more men than women were affected.\n\n The case fatality rate was 19.9%, which was lower than the global rate of 38.7% and the rate in Saudi Arabia (36.5%).\n\n In total, 184 patients were infected nosocomially and there were no community-acquired infections.\n\n The main underlying diseases were respiratory diseases, cancer and hypertension.\n\n The main contributors to the outbreak were late diagnosis, quarantine failure of ‘super spreaders’, familial care-giving and visiting, non-disclosure by patients, poor communication by the South Korean Government, inadequate hospital infection management, and ‘doctor shopping’.\n\n The outbreak was entirely nosocomial, and was largely attributable to infection management and policy failures, rather than biomedical factors.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7114867","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"K.H.","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"T.E.","surname":"Tandi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.W.","surname":"Choi","email":"shine@korea.ac.kr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.M.","surname":"Moon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"M.S.","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3947/ic.2016.48.2.118","date":"2016-06-25","title":"Clinical

general hospital in Saudi Arabia over a four year period.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nAll admitted patients with community acquired pneumonia from 2012 to 2016 were tested for MERS-CoV.\n\n In addition, testing for influenza viruses was carried out starting April 2015.\nResults\nDuring the study period, a total of 2657 patients were screened for MERS-CoV and only 20 (0.74%) tested positive.\n\n From January 2015 to December 2016, a total of 1644 patients were tested for both MERS-CoV and influenza.\n\n None of the patients tested positive for MERS-CoV and 271 (16.4%) were positive for influenza.\n\n The detected influenza viruses were Influenza A (107, 6.5%), pandemic 2009 H1N1 (n = 120, 7.3%), and Influenza B (n = 44, 2.7%).\n\n Pandemic H1N1 was the most common

less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]);

pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin","abstract":"id='Par1'>Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats1–4.\n Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5–7.\n Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China.\n The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak.\n The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV.\n Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus.\n Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development.\n A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\n Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used.\n A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review.\n Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published.\n A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia.\n However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future.\n Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline.\n The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate.\n A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV.\n Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV.\n However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations supported by high-level evidence.\n","id":"PMC7141113","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Junxiong","surname":"Pang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-2019).\n\n\nDesign\nRetrospective case series.\n\n\nSetting\nSeven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China.\n\n\nParticipants\n62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection.\n\n Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period.\n\n If information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study.\n\n According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission.\n\n The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%).\n\n Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission.\n\n The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs of early February 2020, compared with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7224340","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiao-Wei","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Xin","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xian-Gao","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kai-Jin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ling-Jun","surname":"Ying","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-Lian","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shi-Bo","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua-Ying","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sheng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hai-Nv","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-Fang","surname":"Sheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong-Liu","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Qing","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lan-Juan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa1211721","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Isolation

found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route.\n We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology.\n Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may

been associated with an outbreak of atypical pneumonia originating in Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China.\n\n We aimed to identify the causative agent in the Guangdong outbreak and describe the emergence and spread of the disease within the province.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analysed epidemiological information and collected serum and nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with SARS in Guangdong in mid-February, 2003. We did virus isolation, serological tests, and molecular assays to identify the causative agent.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS had been circulating in other cities of Guangdong Province for about 2 months before causing a major outbreak in Guangzhou, the province's capital.\n\n A novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (CoV), was isolated from specimens from three patients with SARS.\n\n Viral antigens were also directly detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from these patients.\n\n 48 of 55 (87%) patients had antibodies to SARS CoV in their convalescent sera.\n\n Genetic analysis showed that the SARS CoV isolates from Guangzhou shared the same origin with those in other countries, and had a phylogenetic pathway that matched the spread of SARS to the other parts of the world.\n\n\nInterpretation\nSARS CoV is the infectious agent responsible for the epidemic outbreak of SARS in Guangdong.\n\n The virus isolated from patients in Guangdong is the prototype of the SARS CoV in other regions and countries.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112415","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"NS","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"BJ","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"YM","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"LLM","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"ZH","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KH","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"PH","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"SY","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Q","surname":"Chang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"JP","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"XQ","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"DX","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KY","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"JSM","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y","surname":"Guan","email":"yguan@hkucc.hku.hk","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001017","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

pimodivir, and baloxavir are inhibitory in preclinical models for influenza A viruses, including pandemic threat viruses and those resistant to currently approved antivirals, and two (favipiravir and baloxavir) also inhibit influenza B viruses.\n\n All are orally administered, although the dosing regimens vary.\n\n The polymerase basic protein 1 transcriptase inhibitor favipiravir has shown inconsistent clinical effects in uncomplicated influenza, and is teratogenic effects in multiple species, contraindicating its use in pregnancy.\n\n The polymerase basic protein 2 cap-binding inhibitor pimodivir displays antiviral effects alone and in combination with oseltamivir in uncomplicated influenza, although variants with reduced susceptibility emerge frequently during monotherapy.\n\n Single doses of the polymerase acidic protein cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir are effective in alleviating symptoms and rapidly inhibiting viral replication in otherwise healthy and higher risk patients with acute influenza, although variants with reduced susceptibility emerge frequently during monotherapy.\n\n Combinations of newer polymerase inhibitors with neuraminidase inhibitors show synergy in preclinical models and are currently undergoing clinical testing in hospitalized patients.\n\n\nSummary\nThese new polymerase inhibitors promise to add to the clinical management options and overall control strategies for influenza virus

Phase 3 Trial of Baloxavir Marboxil in High-Risk Influenza Patients (CAPSTONE-2 Study)","abstract":"Background\nBaloxavir marboxil (BXM), an oral selective cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, is effective and safe for treating acute influenza in otherwise healthy patients.\n\n\nMethod\nWe conducted an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo (PLC)- and oseltamivir (Os)-controlled treatment study in patients at higher risk (HR) of influenza complications.\n\n Inclusion criteria included age ?12 years, fever + influenza symptoms of ?48 hours duration, and presence of at least 1 HR factor adapted from CDC criteria.\n\n Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to a single oral dose of BXM (40/80 mg for BW &lt;/?80 kg), PLC, or 75 mg Os BID for 5 days.\n\n The primary endpoint was time to improvement of influenza symptoms (TTIIS) in those with RT-PCR confirmed influenza (ITTI population).\n\n Secondary endpoints included infectious virus detection in serial nasopharyngeal swabs, prescription of antibiotics, and influenza-related complications.\n\n\nResult\nAmong 2,184 randomized patients, 1,163(53%) comprised the ITTI population (47.9% A/H3N2, 6.9% A/H1N1, 41.6% B).\n\n The most common risk factors were asthma or chronic lung disease (39.2%) and age ?65 years (27.4%).\n\n TTIIS was significantly shorter in BXM than PLC (median 73.2 hours vs.\n\n 102.3 hours, P &lt; 0.0001) and numerically shorter than Os (81.0 hours, P = 0.8347).\n\n TTIIS in BXM patients with A/H3N2 virus (median: 75.4 hours) was significantly shorter than in PLC (100.4 hours; P =0.0141) and was significantly shorter in patients with influenza B (74.6 hours) than in either PLC (100.6 hours; P = 0.0138) or Os (101.6 hours; P = 0.0251).\n\n Median time to cessation of viral shedding in BXM patients was 48 hours, significantly less than 96 hours in both PLC and Os patients.\n\n Systemic antibiotic use and influenza-related complications were significantly fewer in BXM (3.4% and 2.8%, resp.\n\n) than PLC (7.5% and 10.4%;

A(H1N1pdm09)-related critical illness","abstract":"Background\nPatients with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1pdm09)-related critical illness were frequently treated with systemic corticosteroids.\n\n While observational studies have reported significant corticosteroid-associated mortality after adjusting for baseline differences in patients treated with corticosteroids or not, corticosteroids have remained a common treatment in subsequent influenza outbreaks, including avian influenza A(H7N9).\n\n Our objective was to describe the use of corticosteroids in these patients and investigate predictors of steroid prescription and clinical outcomes, adjusting for both baseline and time-dependent factors.\n\n\nMethods\nIn an observational cohort study of adults with H1N1pdm09-related critical illness from 51 Canadian ICUs, we investigated predictors of steroid administration and outcomes of patients who received and those who did not receive corticosteroids.\n\n We adjusted for potential baseline confounding using multivariate logistic regression and propensity score analysis and adjusted for potential time-dependent confounding using marginal structural models.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 607 patients, corticosteroids were administered to 280 patients (46.1 %) at a median daily dose of 227 (interquartile range, 154–443) mg of hydrocortisone equivalents for a median of 7.0 (4.0–13.0) days.\n\n Compared with patients who did not receive corticosteroids, patients who received corticosteroids had higher hospital crude mortality (25.5 % vs 16.4 %, p?=?0.007) and fewer ventilator-free days at 28 days (12.5?±?10.7 vs 15.7?±?10.1, p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n The odds ratio association between corticosteroid use and hospital mortality decreased from 1.85 (95 % confidence interval 1.12–3.04, p?=?0.02) with multivariate logistic regression, to 1.71 (1.05–2.78, p?=?0.03) after adjustment for propensity score to receive corticosteroids, to 1.52 (0.90–2.58, p?=?0.12) after case-matching on propensity score, and to 0.96 (0.28–3.28, p?=?0.95) using marginal structural modeling to adjust for time-dependent between-group differences.\n\n\nConclusions\nCorticosteroids were commonly prescribed for H1N1pdm09-related critical illness.\n\n Adjusting for only baseline between-group differences suggested a significant increased risk of death associated with corticosteroids.\n\n However, after adjusting for time-dependent differences, we found no significant association between corticosteroids and mortality.\n\n These findings highlight the challenges and importance in adjusting for baseline and time-dependent confounders when estimating clinical effects of treatments using observational

It was noted that decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation was associated with inhibited nuclear factor (NF)-?B activation, reduced reactive oxygen species production and increased autophagy.\n Additionally, the combined treatment reduced the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and decreased inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue and bronchioalveolar lavage fluid.\n Consistently, it inhibited the mTOR-NF-?B-NLRP3 inflammasome-IL-1? axis in a lung epithelial cell line.\n These results demonstrated that combined treatment with sirolimus and oseltamivir attenuates pH1N1-induced severe lung injury, which is correlated with suppressed mTOR-NLRP3-IL-1? axis and reduced viral titer.\n Therefore, treatment with sirolimus as an adjuvant along with

trials have suggested that convalescent plasma or anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) might have clinical benefit for patients with influenza infection, but definitive data do not exist.\n\n We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hIVIG in a randomised controlled trial.\n\n\nMethods\nThis randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was planned for 45 hospitals in Argentina, Australia, Denmark, Greece, Mexico, Spain, Thailand, UK, and the USA over five influenza seasons from 2013–14 to 2017–18. Adults (?18 years of age) were admitted for hospital treatment with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B infection and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard care plus either a single 500-mL infusion of high-titre hIVIG (0·25 g/kg bodyweight, 24·75 g maximum; hIVIG group) or saline placebo (placebo group).\n\n Eligible patients had a National Early Warning score of 2 points or greater at the time of screening and their symptoms began no more than 7 days before randomisation.\n\n Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded, as well as any patients for whom the treatment would present a health risk.\n\n Separate randomisation schedules were generated for each participating clinical site using permuted block randomisation.\n\n Treatment assignments were obtained using a web-based application by the site pharmacist who then masked the solution for infusion.\n\n Patients and investigators were masked to study treatment.\n\n The primary endpoint was a six-category ordinal outcome of clinical status at day 7, ranging in severity from death to resumption of normal activities after discharge.\n\n The choice of day 7 was based on haemagglutination inhibition titres from a pilot study.\n\n It was analysed with a proportional odds model, using all six categories to estimate a common odds ratio (OR).\n\n An OR greater than 1 indicated that, for a given category, patients in the hIVIG group were more likely to be in a better category than those in the placebo group.\n\n Prespecified primary analyses for safety and efficacy were based on patients who received an infusion and for whom eligibility could be confirmed.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT02287467.\n\n\nFindings\n313 patients were enrolled in 34 sites between Dec 11, 2014, and May 28, 2018. We also used data from 16 patients enrolled at seven of the 34 sites during the pilot study between Jan 15, 2014, and April 10, 2014. 168 patients were randomly assigned to the hIVIG group and 161 to the placebo group.\n\n 21 patients were excluded (12 from the hIVIG group and 9 from the placebo group) because they did not receive an infusion or their eligibility could not be confirmed.\n\n Thus, 308 were included in the primary analysis.\n\n hIVIG treatment produced a robust rise in haemagglutination inhibition titres against influenza A and smaller rises in influenza B titres.\n\n Based on the proportional odds model, the OR on day 7 was 1·25 (95% CI 0·79–1·97; p=0·33).\n\n In subgroup analyses for the primary outcome, the OR in patients with influenza A was 0·94 (0·55–1·59) and was 3·19 (1·21–8·42) for those with influenza B (interaction p=0·023).\n\n Through 28 days of follow-up, 47 (30%) of 156 patients in the hIVIG group and in 45 (30%) of 152 patients in the placebo group had the composite safety outcome of death, a serious adverse event, or a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (hazard ratio [HR] 1·06, 95% CI 0·70–1·60; p=0·79).\n\n Six (4%) patients in the hIVIG group and five (3%) in the placebo group died, but these deaths were not necessarily related to treatment.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWhen administered alongside standard care (most commonly oseltamivir), hIVIG was not superior to placebo for adults hospitalised with influenza infection.\n\n By contrast with our prespecified subgroup hypothesis that hIVIG would result in more favourable responses in patients with influenza A than B, we found the opposite effect.\n\n The clinical benefit of hIVIG for patients with influenza B is supported by antibody affinity analyses, but confirmation is warranted.\n\n\nFunding\nNIAID and NIH.\n\n Partial support was provided by the Medical Research Council (MRC_UU_12023/23) and the Danish National Research Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6868512","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Richard

of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the associated infection risk.\n\n\nMethods:\nAll patients with the diagnosis of probable SARS admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong from March 9 to April 28, 2003, and who had SARS-related respiratory distress complications were recruited for NIPPV usage.\n\n The health status of all health-care workers working in the NIPPV wards was closely monitored, and consent was obtained to check serum for coronavirus serology.\n\n Patient outcomes and the risk of SARS transmission to health-care workers were assessed.\n\n\nResults:\nNIPPV was applied to 20 patients (11 male patients) with ARF secondary to SARS.\n\n Mean age was 51.4 years, and mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 5.35. Coronavirus serology was positive in 95% (19 of 20 patients).\n\n NIPPV was started 9.6 days (mean) from symptom onset, and mean duration of NIPPV usage was 84.3 h.\n\n Endotracheal intubation was avoided in 14 patients (70%), in whom the length of ICU stay was shorter (3.1 days vs 21.3 days, p &lt; 0.001) and the chest radiography score within 24 h of NIPPV was lower (15.1 vs 22.5, p = 0.005) compared to intubated patients.\n\n Intubation avoidance was predicted by a marked reduction in respiratory rate (9.2 breaths/min) and supplemental oxygen requirement (3.1 L/min) within 24 h of NIPPV.\n\n Complications were few and reversible.\n\n There were no infections among the 105 health-care workers caring for the patients receiving NIPPV.\n\n\nConclusions:\nNIPPV was effective in the treatment of ARF in the patients with SARS studied, and its use was safe for health-care workers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094489","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas

affected by severe pandemic (H1N1)v influenza A infection","abstract":"Introduction\nEarly use of corticosteroids in patients affected by pandemic (H1N1)v influenza A infection, although relatively common, remains controversial.\n\n\nMethods\nProspective, observational, multicenter study from 23 June 2009 through 11 February 2010, reported in the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) H1N1 registry.\n\n\nResults\nTwo hundred twenty patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with completed outcome data were analyzed.\n\n Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 155 (70.5%).\n\n Sixty-seven (30.5%) of the patients died in ICU and 75 (34.1%) whilst in hospital.\n\n One hundred twenty-six (57.3%) patients received corticosteroid therapy on admission to ICU.\n\n Patients who received corticosteroids were significantly older and were more likely to have coexisting asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic steroid use.\n\n These patients receiving corticosteroids had increased likelihood of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) [26.2% versus 13.8%, p &lt; 0.05; odds ratio (OR) 2.2, confidence interval (CI) 1.1–4.5].\n\n Patients who received corticosteroids had significantly higher ICU mortality than patients who did not (46.0% versus 18.1%, p &lt; 0.01; OR 3.8, CI 2.1–7.2).\n\n Cox regression analysis adjusted for severity and potential confounding factors identified that early use of corticosteroids was not significantly associated with mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.3, 95% CI 0.7–2.4, p = 0.4] but was still associated with an increased rate of HAP (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0–4.8, p &lt; 0.05).\n\n When only patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were analyzed, similar results were observed.\n\n\nConclusions\nEarly use of corticosteroids in patients affected by pandemic (H1N1)v influenza A infection did not result in better outcomes and was associated with increased risk of superinfections.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7079858","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"I.","surname":"Martin-Loeches","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T.","surname":"Lisboa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.","surname":"Rhodes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R.
