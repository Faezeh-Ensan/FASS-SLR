findings in COVID-19 related neurological manifestations.\n\n Descriptive analyses were conducted to observe the CSF protein and cell counts based on age, gender, severity, fatality of COVID-19, and

the subcortical white matter but not the cortical grey matter.\n\n This study describes the disruptive effects of AHNE associated with SARS-CoV-2 on cognitive function in a previously healthy and sound middle-aged woman resulting from alterations in cortical areas involved in the cognitive network.\n\n\nCase Report:\nA 44-year-old previously healthy woman with a history of inter-state travel developed a flu-like illness, followed by acute, steadily progressive cognitive impairment.\n\n She was admitted in a comatose state after a first tonic-clonic seizure.\n\n Blood tests were

COVID-19, but little is known about pathophysiological mechanisms.\n\n In this single-center study, we describe neurological manifestations of 58 patients, regarding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and neuroimaging findings.\n\n\nMethods\n58 COVID-19 patients with neurologic manifestations and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR screening on CSF analysis were included.\n\n Clinical, laboratory, and brain MRI data were retrospectively collected and analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nPatients were mostly men (66%) with a median age of 62 years.\n\n Encephalopathy was frequent (81%), followed by a pyramidal dysfunction (16%), seizures (10%), and headaches (5%).\n\n Protein and albumin levels in CSF were increased in 38% and 23%, respectively.\n\n A total of 40% of patients displayed an elevated albumin quotient suggesting impaired blood?brain barrier integrity.\n\n CSF-specific IgG oligoclonal band was found in five (11%) cases, suggesting an intrathecal synthesis of IgG, and 26 (55%) patients presented identical oligoclonal bands in serum and CSF.\n\n Four (7%) patients harbored a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in CSF.\n\n Regarding brain MRI, 20 (38%) patients presented leptomeningeal

manifestations of COVID-19, which have attracted broad attention.\n\n Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare complication of influenza and other viral infections and has been related to intracranial cytokine storm, which results in breach in blood–brain barrier leading to encephalitis like presentation.\n\n We report an unusual case of acute necrotizing encephalitis as a solitary presentation of COVID-19.\nCase description\nWe report a case of 35-year-old man from Bihar, presented to our emergency department in unconscious state, with high-grade fever and vomiting since last 5 days.\n\n Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed a left parasellar-middle cranial fossa mass looks most likely like an invasive meningioma.\n\n Urgent noncontrast computed tomography scan (NCCT) brain showed that mass as well as hypodensities in both thalami and left caudate nucleus.\n\n As per our institutional protocol, clinical management of raised intracranial pressure was initiated.\n\n As there is no current evidence from any randomized control trails (RCTs) to recommend any specific treatment for suspected or confirmed patients with COVID-19 with acute necrotizing

renal unit.\n\n\nResults\nNeurological presentation included confusion, tremor, cerebellar ataxia, behavioral alterations, aphasia, pyramidal syndrome, coma, cranial nerve palsy, dysautonomia, and central hypothyroidism.\n\n Notably, neurological disturbances were accompanied by laboratory evidence of CRS.\n\n Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus?2 (SARS?CoV?2) was undetectable in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\n Hyperalbuminorrachia and increased levels of the astroglial protein S100B were suggestive of blood?brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction.\n\n Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings comprised evidence of acute leukoencephalitis (n = 3, one of whom had a hemorrhagic form), cytotoxic edema mimicking ischaemic stroke (n = 1), or normal results (n = 2).\n\n Treatment with corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulins was attempted, resulting in rapid recovery from neurological disturbances in two cases.\n\n SARS?CoV2 was undetectable in 88 of the 90 patients with COVID?19 who underwent Reverse Transcription?PCR testing of CSF.\n\n\nConclusions\nPatients with COVID?19 can develop neurological manifestations that share clinical, laboratory and imaging similarities with those of chimeric antigen receptor T?cell?related encephalopathy.\n\n The pathophysiological underpinnings appear to involve CRS, endothelial activation, BBB dysfunction, and immune?mediated mechanisms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7461405","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Perrin","email":"peggy.perrin@chru-strasbourg.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"N.","surname":"Collongues","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"N.","surname":"Collongues","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Baloglu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Baloglu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"D.","surname":"Bedo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"X.","surname":"Bassand","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"T.","surname":"Lavaux","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"G.","surname":"Gautier?Vargas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"N.","surname":"Keller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Kremer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Fafi?Kremer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"B.","surname":"Moulin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"I.","surname":"Benotmane","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"I.","surname":"Benotmane","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Caillard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/0333102420965963","date":"2020-09-23","title":"Isolated

out to also act multisystematically with substantial impact on the brain.\n\n A growing number of studies suggests a diverse spectrum of neurological manifestations.\n\n To investigate the spectrum of symptoms, we here describe the neurological manifestations and complications of patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection who have been hospitalized at the RWTH University Hospital Aachen, Germany.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Between March and September 2020, we evaluated common symptoms, clinical characteristics, laboratory (including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis), radiological, and electroencephalography (EEG) data from 53 patients admitted with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\n We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA) to screen for cognitive impairment, when feasible.\n\n We compared critically ill and non-critically ill patients categorized according to the presence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Major clinical neurological features of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were coordination deficits (74%), cognitive impairment (61.5%), paresis (47%), abnormal reflex status (45%), sensory abnormalities (45%), general muscle weakness and pain (32%), hyposmia (26%), and headache (21%).\n\n Patients with ARDS were more severely affected than non-ADRS patients.\n\n 29.6% of patients with ARDS presented with subarachnoid bleedings, and 11.1% showed ischemic stroke associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Cognitive deficits mainly affected executive functions, attention, language, and delayed memory recall.\n\n We obtained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by lumbar puncture in nine of the 53 patients, none of which had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>In line with previous findings, our results provide evidence for a range of SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological manifestations.\n\n 26% of patients reported hyposmia, emphasizing the neuro-invasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, which can enter the olfactory bulb.\n\n It can therefore be speculated that neurological manifestations may be caused by direct invasion of the virus in the CNS; however, PCR did not reveal positive intrathecal SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we hypothesize it is more likely that the para-infectious severe pro-inflammatory impact of COVID-19 is responsible for the neurological deficits including cognitive impairment.\n\n Future

Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, COVID-ME) during the COVID pandemic.\n We formed two control groups: non-COVID patients with ME (non-COVID-ME) and COVID patients without ME (COVID-non-ME).\n Unadjusted comparisons between cases and controls were performed regarding 57 baseline and clinical characteristics and 4 outcomes.\n Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemical and serologic findings of COVID-ME and non-COVID-ME were also investigated.\n We identified 29 ME in 71,904 patients with COVID-19 attending EDs (0.40‰, 95%CI=0.27–0.58).\n This incidence was higher than that observed in non-COVID patients (150/1,358,134, 0.11‰, 95%CI=0.09–0.13; OR=3.65, 95%CI=2.45–5.44).\n With respect to non-COVID-ME, COVID-ME more frequently had dyspnea and chest X-ray abnormalities, and neck stiffness was less frequent (OR=0.3, 95%CI=0.1–0.9).\n In 69.0% of COVID-ME, CSF cells were predominantly lymphocytes, and SARS-CoV-2 antigen was detected by RT-PCR in 1 patient.\n The clinical characteristics associated with a higher risk of presenting ME in COVID patients were vomiting (OR=3.7, 95%CI=1.4–10.2), headache (OR=24.7, 95%CI=10.2–60.1), and altered mental status (OR=12.9, 95%CI=6.6–25.0).\n COVID-ME patients had a higher in-hospital mortality than non-COVID-ME patients (OR=2.26; 95%CI=1.04–4.48), and a higher need for hospitalization (OR=8.02; 95%CI=1.19–66.7) and intensive care admission (OR=5.89; 95%CI=3.12–11.14) than COVID-non-ME patients.\n ME is an unusual form of COVID presentation (&lt;0.5‰ cases), but is more than 4-fold more frequent than in non-COVID patients attending the ED.\n As the majority of these MEs had lymphocytic predominance and in one patient SARS-CoV-2 antigen was detected in CSF, SARS-CoV-2 could be the cause of most of the cases observed.\n COVID-ME patients had a higher unadjusted in-hospital mortality than non-COVID-ME patients.\n","id":"PMC7939927","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marcos","surname":"Fragiel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Òscar","surname":"Miró","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pere","surname":"Llorens","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sònia","surname":"Jiménez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pascual","surname":"Piñera

complications, including encephalitis.\n\n Most cases showed features consistent with a central nervous system (CNS) cytokine-mediated damage.\n\n However, few cases arguing for an autoimmune mechanism have been described, mainly as single reports or sparse in large case series involving other CNS manifestations.\n\n In this paper, we described a case of definite autoimmune limbic encephalitis (LE) COVID-19 related and reviewed the existing literature on other reported cases.\n\n\nCase report\nTwo weeks after the onset of COVID-19 infection, a 74-year-old woman presented with subacute confusion and focal motor seizures with impaired awareness, starting from left temporal region.\n\n Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed hyperproteinorrachia.\n\n Brain MRI showed bilateral T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in both hippocampi and total body PET/TC scan revealed hypermetabolism in basal ganglia bilaterally.\n\n A diagnosis of autoimmune LE was made.\n\n Thus, high dose corticosteroids and antiseizure medications were started, with a marked improvement of neurological conditions.\n\n\nLiterature review\nWe systematically reviewed the literature to identify all well-documented cases of definite autoimmune LE (according to Graus criteria) in patients with COVID-19 infection, identifying other five cases exhibiting a good response to immunomodulating therapy.\n\n\nConclusion\nA very limited number of autoimmune LE have been described until now.\n\n It is important to monitor neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients and to consider the possibility of an autoimmune LE, in particular when altered mental status and seizures appear late in the disease course.\n\n This allows to promptly start the appropriate treatments and avoid unnecessary

SARS-CoV-2 infection and encephalitis (COV-Enc), encephalitis without SARS-CoV-2 infection (ENC) and healthy controls (HC) underwent an extended panel of CSF neuronal (NfL, T-tau), glial (GFAP, TREM2, YKL-40) and inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1?, IL-6, Il-8, TNF- ?, CXCL-13 and ?2-microglobulin).\n\n\nResults\nThirteen COV-Enc, 21 ENC and 18 HC entered the study.\n\n In COV-Enc cases, CSF was

symptoms have been frequently reported in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19), and biomarkers of central nervous system (CNS) injury are reported to be increased in plasma but not extensively studied in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\n This study examined CSF for biomarkers of CNS injury and other pathology in relation to neurological symptoms and disease severity in patients with neurological manifestations of COVID?19.\nMethods\nNineteen patients with neurological symptoms and mild to critical COVID?19 were prospectively included.\n\n Extensive analysis of CSF, including measurement of biomarkers of CNS injury (neurofilament light chain [NfL] protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAp], and total tau), was performed and compared to neurological features and disease severity.\n\n\nResults\nNeurological symptoms included altered mental status (42%), headache (42%), and central (21%) and peripheral weakness (32%).\n\n Two patients demonstrated minor pleocytosis, and four patients had increased immunoglobulin G levels in CSF.\n\n Neuronal autoantibody testing using commercial tests was negative in all patients.\n\n Increased CSF levels of NfL protein, total tau, and GFAp were seen in 63%, 37%, and 16% of patients, respectively.\n\n Increased NfL protein correlated with disease severity, time in intensive care, and level of consciousness.\n\n NfL protein in CSF was higher in patients with central neurological symptoms.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough limited by the small sample size, our data suggest that levels of NfL protein, GFAp, and total tau in CSF are commonly elevated in patients with COVID?19 with neurological symptoms.\n\n This is in contrast to the standard CSF workup where pathological findings are scarce.\n\n NfL protein, in particular, is associated with central neurological symptoms and disease

specific autoimmunity.\n\n\nDesign\nBlood and CSF samples from eleven critically ill COVID-19 patients presenting with unexplained neurological symptoms including myoclonus, oculomotor disturbance, delirium, dystonia and epileptic seizures, were analyzed for anti-neuronal and anti-glial autoantibodies.\n\n\nResults\nUsing cell-based assays and indirect immunofluorescence on unfixed murine brain sections, all patients showed anti-neuronal autoantibodies in serum or CSF.\n\n Antigens included intracellular and neuronal surface proteins, such as Yo or NMDA receptor, but also various specific undetermined epitopes, reminiscent of the brain tissue binding observed with certain human monoclonal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.\n\n These included vessel endothelium, astrocytic proteins and neuropil of basal ganglia, hippocampus or olfactory bulb.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe high frequency of autoantibodies targeting the brain in the absence of other explanations suggests a causal relationship to clinical

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

whether viral RNAemia or viral RNA load in plasma is associated with severe COVID-19 and also to this dysregulated response.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>A total of 250 patients with COVID-19 were recruited (50 outpatients, 100 hospitalized ward patients and 100 critically ill).\n\n Viral RNA detection and quantification in plasma was performed using droplet digital PCR, targeting the N1 and N2 regions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein gene.\n\n The association between SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma with severity was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression.\n\n Correlations between viral RNA load and biomarkers evidencing dysregulation of host response were evaluated by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficients.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The frequency of viral RNAemia was higher in the critically ill patients (78%) compared to ward patients (27%) and outpatients (2%) (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Critical patients had higher viral RNA loads in plasma than non-critically ill patients, with non-survivors showing the highest values.\n\n When outpatients and ward patients were compared, viral RNAemia did not show significant associations in the multivariate analysis.\n\n In contrast, when ward patients were compared with ICU patients, both viral RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma were associated with critical illness (OR [CI 95%], p): RNAemia (3.92 [1.183–12.968], 0.025), viral RNA load (N1) (1.962 [1.244–3.096], 0.004); viral RNA load (N2) (2.229 [1.382–3.595], 0.001).\n\n Viral RNA load in plasma correlated with higher levels of chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2), biomarkers indicative of a systemic inflammatory response (IL-6, CRP, ferritin), activation of NK cells (IL-15), endothelial dysfunction (VCAM-1, angiopoietin-2, ICAM-1),

hematology.\n Nevertheless, pharmacology progress comes with a variety of side effects, of which cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potential complication of some immunotherapies that can lead to multiorgan failure if not diagnosed and treated accordingly.\n CRS generally occurs with therapies that lead to highly activated T cells, like chimeric antigen receptor T cells or in the case of bispecific T-cell engaging antibodies.\n This, in turn, leads to a proinflammatory state with subsequent organ damage.\n To better manage CRS there is a need for specific therapies or to repurpose strategies that are already known to be useful in similar situations.\n Current management strategies for CRS are represented by anticytokine directed therapies and corticosteroids.\n Based on its pathophysiology and the resemblance of CRS to sepsis and septic shock, as well as based on the principles of initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in sepsis, we propose the

in COVID-19 disease","abstract":"COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, accompanies an unprecedented spike in cytokines levels termed cytokines release syndrome (CRS), in critically ill patients.\n Clinicians claim that the surge demonstrates a deregulated immune defence in host, as infected cell expression analysis depicts a delay in type-I (interferon-I) and type-III IFNs expression, along with a limited Interferon-Stimulated Gene (ISG) response, which later resume and culminates in elicitation of several cytokines including- IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF?, IL-17, MCP-1, IP-10 and IL-10 etc.\n Although cytokines are messenger molecules of the immune system, but their increased concentration results in inflammation, infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and lung injury in patients.\n This inflammatory response results in the precarious pathogenesis of COVID-19; thus, a complete estimation of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is vital in designing a harmless and effective vaccine.\n In pathogenesis analysis, it emerges that a timely forceful type-I IFN production (18–24 hrs post infection) promotes innate and acquired immune responses, while a delay in IFNs production (3–4 days post infection) actually renders both innate and acquired responses ineffective in fighting infection.\n Further, underlying conditions including hypertension, obesity, cardio-vascular disease etc may increase the chances of putting people in risk groups, which end up having critical form of infection.\n This review summarizes the events starting from viral entry, its struggle with the immune system and failure of host immunological parameters to obliterate the infections, which finally culminate into massive release of CRS and inflammation in gravely ill patients.\n","id":"PMC7691139","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ritu","surname":"Pasrija","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohammad","surname":"Naime","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.burns.2005.02.004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Removal

load leads to extreme systemic immune response (“cytokine storm”) that is strongly associated with increased severity of COVID?19. Based on the available evidence, it is recommended by a panel of experts that safe but stringent control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipids be carried out in patients with T2DM, measures that could potentially serve to decrease the severity of COVID?19 should these patients contract the viral infection.\n Once the infection occurs, then attention should be directed to proper glycemic control with use of insulin and frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels.\n","id":"PMC7405270","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Aman","surname":"Rajpal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leili","surname":"Rahimi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Leili","surname":"Rahimi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Faramarz","surname":"Ismail?Beigi","email":"fxi2@case.edu","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Faramarz","surname":"Ismail?Beigi","email":"fxi2@case.edu","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1159/000515627","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Extracorporeal Blood Purification in Moderate and Severe COVID-19 Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1159/000511724","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy with oXiris  Membrane in Severe Ebstein-Barr Virus-Mediated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis: A Case Report","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1159/000499510","date":"1970-01-01","title":"oXiris  Use in Septic Shock: Experience of Two French Centres","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3748/wjg.v27.i38.6453","date":"2021-08-23","title":"Effects of acute kidney injury on acute pancreatitis patients’ survival rate in intensive care unit: A retrospective study","abstract":"BACKGROUND\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common acute pancreatitis (AP)-associated complications that has a significant effect on AP, but the factors affecting the AP patients’ survival rate remains unclear.\n\n\nAIM\nTo assess the influences of AKI on the survival rate in AP patients.\n\n \nMETHODS\nA total of 139 AP patients were included in this retrospective study.\n\n Patients were divided into AKI group (n = 72) and non-AKI group (n = 67) according to the occurrence of AKI.\n\n Data were collected from medical records of hospitalized patients.\n\n Then, these data were compared between the two groups and further analysis was performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAKI is more likely to occur in male AP patients (P = 0.009).\n\n AP patients in AKI group exhibited a significantly higher acute physiologic assessment and chronic health evaluation II score, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, lower Glasgow Coma Scale score, and higher demand for mechanical ventilation, infusion of vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy than AP patients in non-AKI group (P &lt;

assigned to each of the associations.\n The TISSUES database (version 2.0) is publicly accessible through a user-friendly web interface and as part of the STRING app for Cytoscape.\n In addition, we

failure of COVID?19 patients","abstract":"Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS?CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS?CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS?CoV?2 (previously known as 2019?nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world.\n This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS?CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS?CoV and MERS?CoV.\n The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID?19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously.\n Additionally, some patients with COVID?19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases.\n The infection of SARS?CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected.\n Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse?connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways.\n Considering the high similarity between SARS?CoV and SARS?CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS?CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID?19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS?CoV?2?induced respiratory failure.\n","id":"PMC7228394","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan?Chao","surname":"Li","email":"liyanchao@jlu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tsutomu","surname":"Hashikawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.abb2507","date":"2020-02-17","title":"Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation","abstract":"The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to be a public health emergency of international concern.\n The virus binds to host cells through its trimeric spike glycoprotein, making this protein a key target for potential therapies and diagnostics.\n Wrapp et al.\n determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the 2019-nCoV trimeric spike protein by cryo–electron microscopy.\n Using biophysical assays, the authors show that this protein binds at least 10 times more tightly than the corresponding spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–CoV to their common host cell receptor.\n They also tested three antibodies known to bind to the SARS-CoV spike protein but did not detect binding to the 2019-nCoV spike protein.\n These studies provide valuable information to guide the development of medical counter-measures for 2019-nCoV.\n","id":"PMC7164637","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Wrapp","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nianshuang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nianshuang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kizzmekia S.","surname":"Corbett","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kizzmekia S.","surname":"Corbett","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jory A.","surname":"Goldsmith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jory A.","surname":"Goldsmith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ching-Lin","surname":"Hsieh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Olubukola","surname":"Abiona","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Barney S.","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Barney S.","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jason S.","surname":"McLellan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jason S.","surname":"McLellan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1021/acschemneuro.6b00197","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis: Neurochemotaxis and Neurotropic Preferences of Naegleria fowleri","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.1111/ene.14273","date":"2020-04-16","title":"Acute?onset smell and taste disorders in the context of COVID?19: a pilot multicentre polymerase chain reaction based case–control study","abstract":"Background and purpose\nSpecific respiratory tract infections, including COVID?19, may cause smell and/or taste disorders (STDs) with increased frequency.\n\n The aim was to determine whether new?onset STDs are more frequent amongst COVID?19 patients than influenza patients.\n\n\nMethod\nThis was a case–control study including hospitalized patients of two tertiary care centres.\n\n Consecutive patients positive for COVID?19 polymerase chain reaction (cases) and patients positive for influenza polymerase chain reaction (historical control sample) were assessed during specific periods, employing a self?reported STD questionnaire.\n\n\nResults\nSeventy?nine cases and 40 controls were included.\n\n No significant differences were found in basal features between the two groups.\n\n New?onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst cases (31, 39.2%) than in the control group (5, 12.5 %) [adjusted odds ratio 21.4 (2.77–165.4, P = 0.003)].\n\n COVID?19 patients with new?onset STDs were significantly younger than COVID?19 patients without STDs (52.6 ± 17.2 vs.\n\n 67.4 ± 15.1, P &lt; 0.001).\n\n Amongst COVID?19 patients who presented STDs, 22 (70.9%) recalled an acute onset and it was an initial manifestation in 11 (35.5%).\n\n Twenty?five (80.6%) presented smell disorders (mostly anosmia, 14, 45.2%) and 28 (90.3%) taste disorders (mostly ageusia, 14, 45.2%).\n\n Only four (12.9 %) reported concomitant nasal obstruction.\n\n The mean duration of STD was 7.5 ± 3.2 days and 12 patients (40%) manifested complete recovery after 7.4 ± 2.3 days of onset.\n\n\nConclusion\nNew?onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst COVID?19 patients than influenza patients;

immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but gained little information on the organ distribution of SARS?associated coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS?CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS?CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS?CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS.\n SARS?CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle.\n These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS?CoV may also be targets of SARS?CoV infection.\n The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS?CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection.\n In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS?CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission.\n This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS?CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways.\n This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS.\n Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n

respiratory tract infection.\n\n In recent years the importance of extrapulmonary manifestations of RSV infection has become evident.\n\n This systematic review aimed at summarizing the available evidence on manifestations of RSV infection outside the respiratory tract, their causes and the changes in clinical management required.\n\n\nMethods\nDatabases searched were Medline (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), PubMed and reference lists of relevant articles.\n\n Summarized were the findings of articles reporting on manifestations of RSV infection outside the respiratory tract in patients of all age groups.\n\n\nResults\nExtrapulmonary manifestations reported in previous observational studies included cardiovascular failure with hypotension and inotrope requirements associated with myocardial damage as evident from elevated cardiac troponin levels (35–54% of ventilated infants), cardiac arrhythmias like supraventricular tachycardias and ventricular tachycardias, central apnoeas (16–21% of admissions), focal and generalized seizures, focal neurological abnormalities, hyponatraemia (33%) associated with increased antidiuretic hormone secretion, and hepatitis (46–49% of ventilated infants).\n\n RSV or its genetic material have been isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, myocardium, liver and peripheral blood.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe data summarized indicate a systemic dissemination of RSV during severe disease.\n\n Cerebral and myocardial involvement may explain the association of RSV with some cases of sudden infant death.\n\n In infants with severe RSV

regarding heart function in infants with bronchiolitis associated with RSV infection have yet been systematically collected.\n\n The aim of this study was to verify the real frequency of heart involvement in patients with bronchiolitis associated with RSV infection, and whether infants with mild or moderate disease also risk heart malfunction.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 69 otherwise healthy infants aged 1-12 months with bronchiolitis hospitalised in standard wards were enrolled.\n\n Pernasal flocked swabs were performed to collect specimens for the detection of RSV by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and a blood sample was drawn to assess troponin I concentrations.\n\n On the day of admission, all of the infants underwent 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring and a complete heart evaluation with echocardiography.\n\n Patients were re-evaluated by investigators blinded to the etiological and cardiac findings four weeks after enrolment.\n\n\nResults\nRegardless of their clinical presentation, sinoatrial blocks were identified in 26/34 RSV-positive patients (76.5%) and 1/35 RSV-negative patients (2.9%) (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n The blocks recurred more than three times over 24 hours in 25/26 RSV-positive patients (96.2%) and none of the RSV-negative infants.\n\n Mean and maximum heart rates were significantly higher in the RSV-positive infants (p &lt; 0.05), as was low-frequency power and the low and high-frequency power ratio (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n The blocks were significantly more frequent in the children with an RSV load of ?100,000 copies/mL than in those with a lower viral load (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Holter ECG after 28 ± 3 days showed the complete regression of the heart abnormalities.\n\n\nConclusions\nRSV seems associated with sinoatrial blocks and transient rhythm alterations even when the related respiratory problems are mild or moderate.\n\n Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of these rhythm problems and whether they remain asymptomatic and transient even in presence of severe respiratory involvement or chronic underlying

also belong to the Nidovirales despite having a much smaller genome (13–16 kb).\n Common and unique features that have been identified for either large or all nidoviruses are outlined.\n These include the nidovirus genetic plan and genome diversity, the composition of the replicase machinery and virus particles, virus-specific accessory genes, the mechanisms of RNA and protein synthesis, and the origin and evolution of nidoviruses with small and large genomes.\n Nidoviruses employ single-stranded, polycistronic RNA genomes of positive polarity that direct the synthesis of the subunits of the replicative complex, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase.\n Replicase gene expression is under the principal control of a ribosomal frameshifting signal and a chymotrypsin-like protease, which is assisted by one or more papain-like proteases.\n A nested set of subgenomic RNAs is synthesized to express the 3?-proximal ORFs that encode most conserved structural proteins and, in some large nidoviruses, also diverse accessory proteins that may promote virus adaptation to specific hosts.\n The replicase machinery includes a set of RNA-processing enzymes some of which are unique for either all or large nidoviruses.\n The acquisition of these enzymes may have improved the low fidelity of RNA replication to allow genome expansion and give rise to the ancestors of small and, subsequently, large nidoviruses.\n","id":"PMC7114179","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander

viral RNA persisted for several months.\n Some of the animals surviving to acute encephalitis presented an abnormal limb clasping reflex and a decrease in motor activity starting several months

including people acutely infected with the pandemic A/California/04/2009 (CA/09) H1N1 virus.\n Based on previous studies showing that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 virus was neurotropic, induced CNS inflammation and a transient parkinsonism, we examined the neurotropic and inflammatory potential of the CA/09 H1N1 virus in mice.\n Following intranasal inoculation, we found no evidence for CA/09 H1N1 virus neurotropism in the enteric, peripheral or central nervous systems.\n We did, however, observe a robust increase in microglial activity in the brain characterized by an increase in the number of activated Iba-1-positive microglia in the substantia nigra (SN) and the hippocampus, despite the absence of virus in the brain.\n qPCR analysis in SN tissue showed that the induction of microgliosis was preceded by reduced gene expression of the neurotrophic factors bdnf, and gdnf and increases in the immune modulatory chemokine chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (ccl4).\n We also noted changes in the expression of transforming growth factor-1 (tgf?1) in the SN starting at 7 days post-infection (dpi) that was sustained through 21 dpi, coupled with increases in arginase-1 (arg1) and csf1, M2 markers for microglia.\n Given that neuroinflammation contributes to generation and progression of a number of neurodegenerative disorders, these findings have significant implications as they highlight the possibility that influenza and perhaps other non-neurotropic viruses can initiate inflammatory signals via microglia activation in the brain and contribute to, but not necessarily be the primary cause of, neurodegenerative disorders.\n","id":"PMC4393251","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shankar","surname":"Sadasivan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Zanin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"O’Brien","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stacey","surname":"Schultz-Cherry","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard

neuropsychiatric disorders in humans.\n In order to study early influenza virus exposure in the brain, we created an influenza-infection model in neonatal mice to investigate infection route and resulting pathological changes in the brain.\n Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses showed that influenza virus infection induced by an intraperitoneal injection was first detected as early as 1 day post infection (dpi), and the peak infection was observed at 5 dpi.\n The viral antigen was detected in a wide range of brain regions, including: the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem.\n Apoptotic cell death and gliosis were detected in the areas of viral infection.\n Significant increases in proinflammatory cytokine expression were also observed at 5 dpi.\n Viral RNAs were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of infected adult mice as early as 1 dpi.\n In addition, many infected cells were observed near the ventricles, indicating that the virus may enter the brain parenchyma through the ventricles.\n These results demonstrate that influenza virus may effectively infect broad regions of the brain through the hematogenous route, potentially through the cerebrospinal fluid along the ventricles, and subsequently induce neuropathological changes in the neonatal mouse

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

respiratory viruses have placed themselves as relevant agents responsible for CNS pathologies.\n Among these neuropathological viruses are the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), the influenza virus (IV), the coronavirus (CoV) and the human metapneumovirus (hMPV).\n These viral agents are leading causes of acute respiratory infections every year affecting mainly children under 5 years old and also the elderly.\n Up to date, several reports have described the association between respiratory viral infections with neurological symptoms.\n The most frequent clinical manifestations described in these patients are febrile or afebrile seizures, status epilepticus, encephalopathies and encephalitis.\n All these viruses have been found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which suggests that all these pathogens, once in the lungs, can spread throughout the body and eventually reach the CNS.\n The current knowledge about the mechanisms and routes used by these neuro-invasive viruses remains scarce.\n In this review article, we describe the most recent findings associated to neurologic complications, along with data about the possible invasion routes of these viruses in humans and their various effects on the CNS, as studied in animal models.\n","id":"PMC6212673","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Karen","surname":"Bohmwald","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicolás M.

Several infectious pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites cross the BCSFB to enter the central nervous system (CNS), ultimately leading to inflammatory infectious diseases like meningitis and meningoencephalitis.\n The CP responds to this challenge by the production of chemokines and cytokines as well as alterations of the barrier function of the BCSFB.\n During the course of CNS infectious disease host immune cells enter the CNS, eventually contributing to the cellular damage caused by the disease.\n Additional complications, which are in certain cases caused by choroid plexitis, can arise due to the response of the CP to the pathogens.\n In this review we will give an overview on the multiple functions of the CP during brain infections highlighting the CP as a multi-role player during infectious diseases of the CNS.\n In this context the importance of tools for investigation of these CP functions and a possible suitability of the CP as therapeutic target

Chikungunya: Young Age and Inefficient Type-I Interferon Signaling Are Risk Factors for Severe Disease","abstract":"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging arbovirus responsible for a massive outbreak currently afflicting the Indian Ocean region and India.\n Infection from CHIKV typically induces a mild disease in humans, characterized by fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash.\n Cases of severe CHIKV infection involving the central nervous system (CNS) have recently been described in neonates as well as in adults with underlying conditions.\n The pathophysiology of CHIKV infection and the basis for disease severity are unknown.\n To address these critical issues, we have developed an animal model of CHIKV infection.\n We show here that whereas wild type (WT) adult mice are resistant to CHIKV infection, WT mouse neonates are susceptible and neonatal disease severity is age-dependent.\n Adult mice with a partially (IFN-?/?R+/?) or totally (IFN-?/?R?/?) abrogated type-I IFN pathway develop a mild or severe infection, respectively.\n In mice with a mild infection, after a burst of viral replication in the liver, CHIKV primarily targets muscle, joint, and skin fibroblasts, a cell and tissue tropism similar to that observed in biopsy samples of CHIKV-infected humans.\n In case of severe infections, CHIKV also disseminates to other tissues including the CNS, where it specifically targets the choroid plexuses and the leptomeninges.\n Together, these data indicate that CHIKV-associated symptoms match viral tissue and cell tropisms, and demonstrate that the fibroblast is a predominant target cell of CHIKV.\n These data also identify the neonatal phase and inefficient type-I IFN signaling as risk factors for severe CHIKV-associated disease.\n The development of a permissive small animal model will expedite the testing of future vaccines and therapeutic candidates.\n","id":"PMC2242832","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thérèse","surname":"Couderc","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fabrice","surname":"Chrétien","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Clémentine","surname":"Schilte","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olivier","surname":"Disson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Madly","surname":"Brigitte","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Florence","surname":"Guivel-Benhassine","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yasmina","surname":"Touret","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Georges","surname":"Barau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nadège","surname":"Cayet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Isabelle","surname":"Schuffenecker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Desprès","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fernando","surname":"Arenzana-Seisdedos","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alain","surname":"Michault","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthew

Encephalitis occurred most commonly in children 1 to 1.9 years of age, among whom the incidence was 16.7 per 100,000 child?years.\n The incidence remained quite high until the age of 10 years, and then gradually declined to 1.0 per 100,000 child?years at the age of 15 years.\n Since 1983, when mumps, measles, and rubella vaccination eradicated the encephalitides associated with these microbes, the major associated agents have been varicella?zoster, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory and enteroviruses.\n In infants younger than 1 year of age, the major agents were enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, and the group of “others,” whereas in older children, respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma Pneumoniae as well as varicella?zoster virus, dominated.\n In children aged 1 to 11 months, the causal agent could not be identified in one?half of all cases, whereas in children who were at least 10 years old, the etiology remained unknown in only one?fourth of cases.\n Male dominance was most evident in the 4? to 9?year age group.\n The difference in etiology between males and females was significant (p = 0.02); mumps and varicella were more common in boys, and adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were more common in girls.\n The overall male?to?female ratio was 1.4:1. Characteristic seasonal variation occurred in encephalitides associated with mumps, measles, and entero? and respiratory viruses.\n In the whole series, some accumulation appeared in February and

Sequelae Resulting from Encephalitic Alphavirus Infection","abstract":"The recent surge in viral clinical cases and associated neurological deficits have reminded us that viral infections can lead to detrimental, long-term effects, termed sequelae, in survivors.\n Alphaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses in the Togaviridae family.\n Transmission of alphaviruses between and within species occurs mainly via the bite of an infected mosquito bite, giving alphaviruses a place among arboviruses, or arthropod-borne viruses.\n Alphaviruses are found throughout the world and typically cause arthralgic or encephalitic disease in infected humans.\n Originally detected in the 1930s, today the major encephalitic viruses include Venezuelan, Western, and Eastern equine encephalitis viruses (VEEV, WEEV, and EEEV, respectively).\n VEEV, WEEV, and EEEV are endemic to the Americas and are important human pathogens, leading to thousands of human infections each year.\n Despite awareness of these viruses for nearly 100 years, we possess little mechanistic understanding regarding the complications (sequelae) that emerge after resolution of acute infection.\n Neurological sequelae are those complications involving damage to the central nervous system that results in cognitive, sensory, or motor deficits that may also manifest as emotional instability and seizures in the most severe cases.\n This article serves to provide an overview of clinical cases documented in the past century as well as a summary of the reported neurological sequelae due to VEEV, WEEV, and EEEV infection.\n We conclude with a treatise on the utility of, and practical considerations for animal models applied to the problem of neurological sequelae of viral encephalopathies in order to decipher mechanisms and interventional strategies.\n","id":"PMC4913092","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shannon

causative pathogen in central nervous system (CNS) infections is crucial for patient management and prognosis.\n Many viruses can cause CNS infections, yet screening for each individually is costly and time-consuming.\n Most metagenomic assays can theoretically detect all pathogens, but often fail to detect viruses because of their small genome and low viral load.\n Viral metagenomics overcomes this by enrichment of the viral genomic content in a sample.\n VIDISCA-NGS is one of the available workflows for viral metagenomics, which requires only a small input volume and allows multiplexing of multiple samples per run.\n The performance of VIDISCA-NGS was tested on 45 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected CNS infections in which a virus was identified and quantified by polymerase chain reaction.\n Eighteen were positive for an RNA virus, and 34 for a herpesvirus.\n VIDISCA-NGS detected all RNA viruses with a viral load &gt;2 × 104 RNA copies/mL (n = 6) and 8 of 12 of the remaining low load samples.\n Only one herpesvirus was identified by VIDISCA-NGS, however, when withholding a DNase treatment, 11 of 18 samples with a herpesvirus load &gt;104 DNA copies/mL were detected.\n Our results indicate that VIDISCA-NGS has the capacity to detect low load RNA viruses in CSF.\n Herpesvirus DNA in clinical samples is probably non-encapsidated and therefore

inflammation remains unknown in approximately 50% of cases.\n High-throughput sequencing was performed to search for viral sequences in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from 26 patients considered to have acute CNS inflammation of unknown origin, and 10 patients with defined causes of CNS diseases.\n In order to better grasp the clinical significance of viral sequence data obtained in CSF, 30 patients without CNS disease who had a lumbar puncture performed during elective spinal anaesthesia were also analysed.\n One case of human astrovirus (HAstV)-MLB2-related meningitis and disseminated infection was identified.\n No other viral sequences that can easily be linked to CNS inflammation were detected.\n Viral sequences obtained in all patient groups are discussed.\n While some of them reflect harmless viral infections, others result from reagent or sample contamination, as well as index hopping.\n Altogether, this study highlights the potential of high-throughput

unknown.\n\n We aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from episodes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) due to RSV in children younger than 5 years in 2005.\nMethods\nWe estimated the incidence of RSV-associated ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality ratios with incidence estimates from hospital-based reports from published and unpublished studies and identifying studies with population-based data for RSV seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2005, an estimated 33·8 (95% CI 19·3–46·2) million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years (22% of ALRI episodes), with at least 3·4 (2·8–4·3) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission.\n\n We estimated that 66?000–199?000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV-associated ALRI in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries.\n\n Incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year in any one setting.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGlobally, RSV is the most common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of admission to hospital as a result of severe ALRI.\n\n Mortality data suggest that RSV is an important cause of death in childhood from ALRI, after pneumococcal pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae type b.\n\n The development of novel prevention and treatment strategies should be accelerated as a priority.\n\n\nFunding\nWHO; Bill &amp; Melinda Gates

disseminated to the olfactory tubercle and throughout the ventral cortex.\n Transmission electron microscopy on brain tissue showed extravasation of plasma cells, neuronal degeneration and nucleocapsid inclusions in affected tissue and axons, providing further evidence for axonal transport of NiV.\n NiV entry into the CNS coincided with the occurrence of respiratory disease, suggesting

belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and cause acute respiratory illness often during local outbreaks or seasonal epidemics and occasionally during pandemics.\n Recent studies have identified a new genus within the Orthomyxoviridae family.\n This newly identified pathogen, D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK), first identified in pigs with influenza-like illness was classified as the influenza D virus (IDV) which is distantly related to the previously characterized human influenza C virus.\n Several other back-to-back studies soon suggested cattle as the natural reservoir and possible involvement of IDV in the bovine respiratory disease complex was established.\n Not much is known about its likelihood to cause disease in humans, but it definitely poses a potential threat as an emerging pathogen in cattle-workers.\n Here, we review the evolution, epidemiology, virology and pathobiology of influenza D virus and the possibility of transmission among various hosts and potential to cause human

most influenza infections are self-limited, few other diseases exert such a huge toll of suffering and economic loss.\n Despite the importance of influenza, there had been, until recently, little advance in its control since amantadine was licensed almost 40 years ago.\n During the past decade, evidence has accrued on the protection afforded by inactivated vaccines and the safety and efficacy in children of live influenza-virus vaccines.\n There have been many new developments in vaccine technology.\n Moreover, work on viral neuraminidase has led to the licensing of potent selective antiviral drugs, and economic decision modelling provides further justification for annual vaccination and a framework for the use of neuraminidase inhibitors.\n Progress has also been made on developing near-patient testing for influenza that may assist individual diagnosis or the recognition of widespread virus circulation, and so optimise clinical management.\n Despite these advances, the occurrence of avian H5N1, H9N2, and H7N7 influenza in human beings and the rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome are reminders of our vulnerability to an emerging pandemic.\n The contrast between recent cases of H5N1 infection, associated with high mortality, and the typically mild, self-limiting nature of human infections with avian H7N7 and H9N2 influenza shows the gaps in our understanding of molecular correlates of pathogenicity and underlines the need for continuing international research into pandemic influenza.\n Improvements in animal and human surveillance, new approaches to vaccination, and increasing use of vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat annual influenza outbreaks are essential to reduce the global toll of pandemic and interpandemic influenza.\n","id":"PMC7112395","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Karl

2004–2005, 47 (5.7%) patients with acute respiratory infection associated with human coronavirus (hCoV) 229E?, NL63?, and OC43?like strains were identified among 823 (597 immunocompetent and 226 immunocompromised) patients admitted to hospital with acute respiratory syndromes.\n Viral infections were diagnosed by either immunological (monoclonal antibodies) or molecular (RT?PCR) methods.\n Each of two sets of primer pairs developed for detection of all CoVs (panCoV) failed to detect 15 of the 53 (28.3%) hCoV strains identified.\n On the other hand, all hCoV strains could be detected by using type?specific primers targeting genes 1ab and N.\n The HuH?7 cell line was found to be susceptible to isolation and identification of OC43? and 229E?like strains.\n Overall, hCoV infection was caused by OC43?like, 229E?like, and NL63?like strains in 25 (53.2%), 10 (21.3%), and 9 (19.1%) patients, respectively.\n In addition, three patients (6.4%) were infected by untypeable hCoV strains.\n NL63?like strains were not found to circulate in 2003–2004, and 229E?like strains did not circulate in 2004–2005, while OC43?like strains were detected in both seasons.\n The monthly distribution reached a peak during January through March.\n Lower predominated over upper respiratory tract infections in each age group.\n In addition, hCoV infections interested only immunocompetent infants and young children during the first year of life, while all adults were immunocompromised patients.\n Coinfections of hCoVs and other respiratory viruses (mostly interesting the first year of life) were observed in 14 of the 47 (29.8%) patients and were associated with severe respiratory syndromes more frequently than hCoV single infections (P?=?0.002).\n In conclusion, the use of multiple primer sets targeting different genes is recommended for diagnosis of all types of hCoV infection.\n In addition, the detection of still untypeable hCoV strains suggests that the number of hCoVs involved in human pathology might further increase.\n Finally, hCoVs should be screened routinely for in both infants and immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory infection.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n

Different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses, but it is not clear which are most suitable.\n Therefore, this review compares animal models of SARS and influenza, with an emphasis on non-human primates, ferrets and cats.\n Firstly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza are compared.\n Both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles.\n Important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra-alveolar fibrosis in SARS and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in H5N1 influenza.\n Secondly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza in man and experimental animals are compared.\n Host species, host age, route of inoculation, location of sampling and timing of sampling are important to design an animal model that most closely mimics human disease.\n The design of appropriate animal models requires an accurate pathological description of human cases, as well as a good understanding of the effect of experimental variables on disease

considered an ideal example of the One Health concept.\n This is due to the animals, especially dromedary camels, play important roles in the transmission and sustainability of the virus, and the virus can be transmitted through aerosols of infected patients into the environment.\n However, there is some debate regarding the origin of MERS-CoV either from bats or other unknown reservoirs.\n The dromedary camel is the only identified animal reservoir to date.\n These animals play important roles in sustaining the virus in certain communities and may act as an amplifier of the virus by secreting it in their body fluids, especially in nasal and rectal discharges.\n MERS-CoV has been detected in the nasal and rectal secretions of infected camels, and MERS-CoV of this origin has full capacity to infect human airway epithelium in both in vitro and in vivo models.\n Other evidence confirms the direct transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans, though the role of camel meat and milk products has yet to be well studied.\n Human-to-human transmission is well documented through contact with an active infected patient or some silently infected persons.\n Furthermore, there are some significant risk factors of individuals in close contact with a positive MERS-CoV patient, including sleeping in the same patient room, removing patient waste (urine, stool, and sputum), and touching respiratory secretions from the index case.\n Outbreaks within family clusters have been reported, whereby some blood relative patients were infected through their wives in the same house were not infected.\n Some predisposing genetic factors favor MERS-CoV infection in some patients, which is worth investigating in the near future.\n The presence of other comorbidities may be another factor.\n Overall, there are many unknown/confirmed aspects of the virus/human/animal network.\n Here, the most recent advances in this context are discussed, and the possible reasons behind the emergence and sustainability of MERS-CoV in certain regions are presented.\n Identification of the exact mechanism of transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans and searching for new reservoir/s are of high priority.\n This will reduce the shedding of the virus into the environment, and thus the risk of human infection can be mitigated.\n","id":"PMC6708572","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maged

age.\n Children hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis (AB), acute gastroenteritis (AGE), or febrile seizures (FS), and children admitted for elective surgical procedures (healthy controls) were included in the study.\n In patients with AB, AGE, and FS, a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and blood sample were obtained upon admission and the follow-up visit 14 days later, whereas in children with AGE a stool sample was also acquired upon admission; in healthy controls a NP swab and stool sample were taken upon admission.\n Amplification of polymerase 1b gene was used to detect HCoVs in the specimens.\n HCoVs-positive specimens were also examined for the presence of several other viruses.\n HCoVs were most often detected in children with FS (19/192, 9.9%, 95% CI: 6–15%), followed by children with AGE (19/218, 8.7%, 95% CI: 5.3–13.3%) and AB (20/308, 6.5%, 95% CI: 4.0–9.8%).\n The presence of other viruses was a common finding, most frequent in the group of children with AB

52.6%.\n","id":"PMC4865086","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Monika","surname":"Jevšnik","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrej","surname":"Steyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marko","surname":"Pokorn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tatjana","surname":"Mrvi?","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Štefan","surname":"Grosek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Franc","surname":"Strle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lara","surname":"Lusa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Miroslav","surname":"Petrovec","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Oliver","surname":"Schildgen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Oliver","surname":"Schildgen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/jmv.1890060309","date":"1980-09-11","title":"Coronavirus

and dysphagia.\n A 5-year-old boy had progressive lower extremity weakness and pain 3?days prior to onset of unilateral peripheral facial palsy.\n On presentation, diagnosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome was supported by areflexia and albuminocytologic dissociation.\n His condition deteriorated with a decline in his respiratory effort and inability to handle secretions.\n He was given non-invasive ventilation to prevent worsening of his acute respiratory failure.\n Brain and spine magnetic resonance imaging scans showed enhancement of the left bulbar nerve complex and anterior and posterior cervical nerve roots with gadolinium.\n Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin led to an uneventful clinical course with partial recovery within 2?weeks.\n In summary, Guillain–Barré syndrome should be considered as a possible cause of unilateral peripheral facial palsy.\n Guillain–Barré syndrome patients with facial nerve and bulbar palsy require close monitoring as they are at risk of

research on South Korea's MERS outbreak was limited to the early stages, when few data were available.\n\n Now that the outbreak has ended, albeit unofficially, a more comprehensive review is appropriate.\n\n\nMethods\nData were obtained through the MERS portal by the Ministry for Health and Welfare (MOHW) and Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, press releases by MOHW, and reports by the MERS Policy Committee of the Korean Medical Association.\n\n Cases were analysed for general characteristics, exposure source, timeline and infection generation.\n\n Sex, age and underlying diseases were analysed for the 38 deaths.\n\n\nFindings\nBeginning with the index case that infected 28 others, an in-depth analysis was conducted.\n\n The average age was 55 years, which was a little higher than the global average of 50 years.\n\n As in most other countries, more men than women were affected.\n\n The case fatality rate was 19.9%, which was lower than the global rate of 38.7% and the rate in Saudi Arabia (36.5%).\n\n In total, 184 patients were infected nosocomially and there were no community-acquired infections.\n\n The main underlying diseases were respiratory diseases, cancer and hypertension.\n\n The main contributors to the outbreak were late diagnosis, quarantine failure of ‘super spreaders’, familial care-giving and visiting, non-disclosure by patients, poor communication by the South Korean Government, inadequate hospital infection management, and ‘doctor shopping’.\n\n The outbreak was entirely nosocomial, and was largely attributable to infection management and policy failures, rather than biomedical factors.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7114867","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"K.H.","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"T.E.","surname":"Tandi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.W.","surname":"Choi","email":"shine@korea.ac.kr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.M.","surname":"Moon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"M.S.","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1159/000453066","date":"2016-11-03","title":"Coronavirus

backgrounds (C57BL/6 and BALB/c).\n Additionally, we monitored the spatial and temporal progression of HCoV-OC43 through the central nervous system (CNS) of live BALB/c mice after intranasal or intracerebral inoculation with rOC43-ns2DelRluc.\n We found that rOC43-ns2DelRluc was fatal to suckling mice after intranasal inoculation, and that viral titers and Rluc expression were detected in the brains and spinal cords of mice infected with rOC43-ns2DelRluc.\n Moreover, viral replication was initially observed in the brain by non-invasive bioluminescence imaging before the infection spread to the spinal cord of BALB/c mice, consistent with its tropism in the CNS.\n Furthermore, the Rluc readout correlated with the HCoV replication ability and protein expression, which allowed quantification of antiviral activity in live mice.\n Additionally, we validated that chloroquine strongly inhibited rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication in vivo.\n These results provide new insights into the

rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK), celiac disease (CD), and multiple sclerosis (MS).\n Best examples of viral infections that have been proposed to modulate the induction and development of autoimmune diseases are the infections with enteric viruses such as Coxsackie B virus (CVB) and rotavirus, as well as influenza A viruses (IAV), and herpesviruses.\n Other viruses that have been studied in this context include, measles, mumps, and rubella.\n Epidemiological studies in humans and experimental studies in animal have shown that viral infections can induce or protect from autoimmunopathologies depending on several factors including genetic background, host-elicited immune responses, type of virus strain, viral load, and the onset time of infection.\n Still, data delineating the clear mechanistic interaction between the virus and the immune system to induce autoreactivity are scarce.\n Available data indicate that viral-induced autoimmunity can be activated through multiple mechanisms including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, bystander activation, and immortalization of infected B cells.\n Contrarily, the protective effects can be achieved via regulatory immune responses which lead to the suppression of autoimmune phenomena.\n Therefore, a better understanding of the immune-related molecular processes in virus-induced autoimmunity is warranted.\n Here we provide an overview of the current understanding of viral-induced autoimmunity and the mechanisms that are associated with this phenomenon.\n","id":"PMC6723519","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria K.","surname":"Smatti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Farhan

Moreover, the interaction between protein 7 and PP1 was required, during the infection, for eIF2? dephosphorylation and inhibition of cell RNA degradation.\n Inoculation of newborn piglets with rTGEV-?7 and rTGEV-wt viruses showed that rTGEV-?7 virus presented accelerated growth kinetics and pathology compared with the parental virus.\n Overall, the results indicated that gene 7 counteracted host cell defenses, and modified TGEV persistence increasing TGEV survival.\n Therefore, the acquisition of gene 7 by the TGEV genome most likely has provided a selective advantage to the virus.\n","id":"PMC3111541","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jazmina L.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January 10 to February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed.\n\n The data of laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection.\n\n The median age was 58 years and 235 were male.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia.\n\n Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.\n\n Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines.\n\n The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases.\n\n Both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, and lower level of helper T cells in severe group.\n\n The percentage of naïve helper T cells increased and memory helper T cells decreased in severe cases.\n\n Patients with COVID-19 also have lower level of regulatory T cells, and more obviously damaged in severe cases.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes.\n\n Surveillance of NLR and lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the early screening of critical illness, diagnosis and treatment of

Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

coronavirus and an origin?unknown coronavirus.\n The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor.\n Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019?nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and most similar codon usage bias with snake.\n Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination may occur and contribute to the 2019?nCoV cross?species

resistance to Theiler’s virus-induced demyelinating disease","abstract":"Background\nExperimental infection of mice with Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is used as an animal model of human multiple sclerosis.\n\n TMEV persists in susceptible mouse strains and causes a biphasic disease consisting of acute polioencephalomyelitis and chronic demyelinating leukomyelitis.\n\n In contrast, resistant mice eliminate the virus within 2 to 4 weeks, which seems to be based on a strong antiviral innate immune response including the activation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway.\n\n Several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as IFN-stimulated protein of 15 kDa (ISG15), protein kinase R (PKR), and 2?5?-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) function as antiviral effectors and might contribute to virus elimination.\n\n Nevertheless, detailed investigations of the type I IFN pathway during TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) are lacking.\n\n\nMethods\nThe present study evaluated microarray data of the spinal cord obtained from susceptible SJL/J mice after TMEV infection focusing on IFN-related genes.\n\n Moreover, ISG gene and protein expression was determined in mock- and TMEV-infected SJL/J mice and compared to its expression in resistant C57BL/6 mice using real- time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence.\n\n\nResults\nInterestingly, despite of increased ISG gene expression during TMEV-IDD, ISG protein expression was impaired in SJL/J mice and mainly restricted to demyelinated lesions.\n\n In contrast, high ISG protein levels were found in spinal cord gray and white matter of C57BL/6 compared to SJL/J mice in the acute and chronic phase of TMEV-IDD.\n\n In both mouse strains, ISG15 was mainly found in astrocytes and endothelial cells, whereas PKR was predominantly expressed by microglia/macrophages, oligodendrocytes, and neurons.\n\n Only few cells were immunopositive for OAS proteins.\n\n\nConclusions\nHigh levels of antiviral ISG15 and PKR proteins in the spinal cord of C57BL/6 mice might block virus replication and play an important role in the

infection by viperin","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Flaviviruses are a group of diverse and emerging arboviruses and an immense global health problem.\n\n A number of flaviviruses are neurotropic, causing severe encephalitis and even death.\n\n Type I interferons (IFNs) are the first line of defense of the innate immune system against flavivirus infection.\n\n IFNs elicit the concerted action of numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to restrict both virus infection and replication.\n\n Viperin (virus-inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated, IFN-inducible) is an ISG with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple flaviviruses in vitro.\n\n Its activity in vivo restricts neurotropic infections to specific regions of the central nervous system (CNS).\n\n However, the cell types in which viperin activity is required are unknown.\n\n Here we have examined both the regional and cell-type specificity of viperin in the defense against infection by several model neurotropic flaviviruses.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Viral burden and IFN induction were analyzed in vivo in wild-type and viperin?/? mice infected with Langat virus (LGTV).\n\n The effects of IFN pretreatment were tested in vitro in primary neural cultures from different brain regions in response to infection with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV).\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Viperin activity restricted nonlethal LGTV infection in the spleen and the olfactory bulb following infection via a peripheral route.\n\n Viperin activity was also necessary to restrict LGTV replication in the olfactory bulb and the cerebrum following CNS infection, but not in the cerebellum.\n\n In vitro, viperin could restrict TBEV replication in primary cortical neurons, but not in the cerebellar granule cell neurons.\n\n Interferon-induced viperin was also very important in primary cortical neurons to control TBEV, WNV, and ZIKV.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Our findings show that viperin restricts replication of neurotropic flaviviruses in the CNS in a region- and cell-type-specific manner.\n\n The most important sites of activity are the olfactory bulb and cerebrum.\n\n Activity within the cerebrum is required in the cortical neurons in order to restrict spread.\n\n This study exemplifies cell type and regional

known which of the numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) mediate the antiviral effect.\n A prominent family of ISGs is the interferon-induced with tetratricopeptide repeats (Ifit) genes comprising three members in mice, Ifit1/ISG56, Ifit2/ISG54 and Ifit3/ISG49.\n Intranasal infection with a low dose of VSV is not lethal to wild-type mice and all three Ifit genes are induced in the central nervous system of the infected mice.\n We tested their potential contributions to the observed protection of wild-type mice from VSV pathogenesis, by taking advantage of the newly generated knockout mice lacking either Ifit2 or Ifit1.\n We observed that in Ifit2 knockout (Ifit2\n?/?) mice, intranasal VSV infection was uniformly lethal and death was preceded by neurological signs, such as ataxia and hind limb paralysis.\n In contrast, wild-type and Ifit1\n?/? mice were highly protected and survived without developing such disease.\n However, when VSV was injected intracranially, virus replication and survival were not significantly different between wild-type and Ifit2?/? mice.\n When administered intranasally, VSV entered the central nervous system through the olfactory bulbs, where it replicated equivalently in wild-type and Ifit2\n?/? mice and induced interferon-?.\n However, as the infection spread to other regions of the brain, VSV titers rose several hundred folds higher in Ifit2\n?/? mice as compared to wild-type mice.\n This was not caused by a broadened cell tropism in the brains of Ifit2\n?/? mice, where VSV still replicated selectively in neurons.\n Surprisingly, this advantage for VSV replication in the brains of Ifit2?/? mice was not observed in other organs, such as lung and liver.\n Pathogenesis by another neurotropic RNA virus,

expression of microRNAs, which in turn modulate cellular immune response by targeting expression of antiviral genes.\n\n The aim of this study is to understand the anti-inflammatory role of miR-146a during JEV infection, which facilitates immune evasion.\n\n\nMethods\nHuman brain microglial cells (CHME3) were infected by JEV: JaOArS982 and P20778 strain, and expression of miR-146a were analyzed.\n\n Overexpression and knockdown studies of miR-146a were done to see the effect on NF-?B pathway and antiviral Jak-STAT pathway.\n\n Regulatory role of miR-146a on expression of interferon-stimulated genes was determined by real-time PCR and luciferase assays.\n\n\nResults\nJEV infection elevated the expression of miR-146a in JaOArS982 strain which caused downregulation of TRAF6, IRAK1, IRAK2, and STAT1 genes.\n\n Exogenous overexpression of miR-146a led to suppression of NF-?B activation and abrogation of Jak-STAT pathway upon JEV infection which led to downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (IFIT-1 and IFIT-2) and facilitated viral replication.\n\n JEV infection initially upregulated cytokine production and activated STAT1 activity but STAT1 levels reduced at later time point, which led to the downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes.\n\n\nConclusion\nUpregulation of miR-146a by JEV JaOArS982 strain leads to suppression of NF-?B activity and disruption of antiviral Jak-STAT signaling which helps the virus to evade the cellular immune response.\n\n This effect of JEV infection on miR-146a expression was found to be strain specific.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12974-015-0249-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

interferon stimulated genes (ISG), the IFP35 reflects the type I interferon (IFN) activity induced through the JAK-STAT phosphorylation, and it can homodimerize with N-myc-interactor (NMI) and basic leucine zipper transcription factor (BATF), resulting in nuclear translocation and a functional expression.\n\n Casein kinase 2-interacting protein-1 (CKIP-1), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 Epinephelus coioides (EcLGP2) are thought to regulate IFP35, via the innate immunity pathway.\n\n Several in vitro and in vivo studies on fish and mammals have confirmed the IFP35 as an ISG factor with antiviral and antiproliferative functions.\n\n However, in a mice model of sepsis, IFP35 was found working as a damage associated molecular pattern

neuroinvasion","abstract":"The blood-brain barrier (BBB), which protects the CNS from pathogens, is composed of specialized brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) joined by tight junctions and ensheathed by pericytes and astrocyte endfeet.\n The stability of the BBB structure and function is of great significance for the maintenance of brain homeostasis.\n When a neurotropic virus invades the CNS via a hematogenous or non-hematogenous route, it may cause structural and functional disorders of the BBB, and also activate the BBB anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory innate immune response.\n This article focuses on the structural and functional changes that occur in the three main components of the BBB (endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes) in response to infection with neurotropic viruses transmitted by hematogenous routes, and also briefly describes the supportive effect of three cells on the BBB under normal physiological conditions.\n For example, all three types of cells express several PRRs, which can quickly sense the virus and make corresponding immune responses.\n The pro-inflammatory immune response will exacerbate the destruction of the BBB, while the anti-inflammatory immune response, based on type I IFN, consolidates the stability of the BBB.\n Exploring the details of the interaction between the host and the pathogen at the BBB during neurotropic virus infection will help to propose new treatments for viral encephalitis.\n Enhancing the defense function of the BBB, maintaining the integrity of the BBB, and suppressing the pro-inflammatory immune response of the BBB provide more ideas for limiting the neuroinvasion of neurotropic viruses.\n In the future, these new treatments are expected to cooperate with traditional antiviral methods to improve the therapeutic effect of viral

through pathogenic mechanisms that are still largely unknown.\n Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are believed to reach the central nervous system by a hematogenous route, upon crossing the blood-brain barrier.\n Although the disruption of BBB during flavivirus infection has been largely evidenced in experimental models, the relevance of BBB breakdown for virus entering the brain was not completely elucidated.\n In vitro models of BBB had demonstrated that these viruses replicated in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), which induced downregulation of tight junction proteins and increased the permeability of the barrier.\n Other reports demonstrated that infection of BMECs allowed the basolateral release of infectious particles, without a remarkable cytopathic effect, what might be sufficient for virus invasion.\n Virus replication and activation of other cells associated to the BBB, mostly astrocytes and microglia, were also reported to affect the endothelial barrier permeability.\n This event might occur simultaneously or after BMECs infection, being a secondary effect leading to BBB disruption.\n Importantly, activation of BMECs, astrocytes, and microglia by flaviviruses was associated to the expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators, which are believed to recruit leukocytes to the CNS.\n The leukocyte infiltrate could further mediate viral invasion through a Trojan horse mechanism and might contribute to BBB breakdown and to neurological alterations.\n This review discussed the previous studies regarding in vitro and in vivo models of JEV, WNV, ZIKV, YFV, DENV, and TBEV infection and addressed the pathways for BBB overcome and invasion of the CNS described for each virus infection, aiming to increment the knowledge and stimulate further discussion about the role of BBB in the neuropathogenesis

viruses, especially intestinal viruses, the inhibitory effect against RABV infection remains undefined.\n In this study, the function of type III IFN against RABV infection was investigated.\n Initially, we found that IFN-?2 and IFN-?3 could inhibit RABV replication in cells.\n To characterize the role of IFN-? in RABV infection in a mouse model, recombinant RABVs expressing murine IFN-?2 or IFN-?3, termed as rB2c-IFN?2 or rB2c-IFN?3, respectively, were constructed and rescued.\n It was found that expression of IFN-? could reduce the pathogenicity of RABV and limit viral spread in the

was also found that rRABVs expressing IFN-? could reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines in primary astrocytes and microgila cells, restrict the opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and prevent excessive infiltration of inflammatory cells into the brain, which could be responsible for the neuronal damage caused by RABV.\n Consistently, IFN-? was found to maintain the integrity of

level, the innate immune system is essential for the detection of viruses and constitutes the first line of defense.\n Viral components are sensed by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).\n PRRs can be further classified based on their localization into Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLR), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and cytosolic DNA sensors (CDS).\n TLR and RLR signaling results in production of type I interferons (IFN? and -?) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in a cell-specific manner, whereas NLR signaling leads to the production of interleukin-1 family proteins.\n On the other hand, CLRs are capable of sensing glycans present in viral pathogens, which can induce phagocytic, endocytic, antimicrobial, and pro- inflammatory responses.\n Peripheral immune sensing of viruses and the ensuing cytokine response can significantly affect the central nervous system (CNS).\n But viruses can also directly enter the CNS via a multitude of routes, such as the nasal epithelium, along nerve fibers connecting to the periphery and as cargo of infiltrating infected cells passing through the

evident that cross talk between the immune system and the CNS does occur.\n\n As a result, patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease or psoriasis, are often further burdened with neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression, anxiety and fatigue.\n\n Despite the recent advances in our understanding of neuroimmune communication pathways, the precise effect of peripheral immune activation on neural circuitry remains unclear.\n\n Utilizing transcriptomics in a well-characterized murine model of systemic inflammation, we have started to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which inflammation originating in the periphery can induce transcriptional modulation in the brain.\n\n\nMethods\nSeveral different systemic and tissue-specific models of peripheral toll-like-receptor-(TLR)-driven (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid and Imiquimod) and sterile (tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)) inflammation were induced in C57BL/6 mice.\n\n Whole brain transcriptional profiles were assessed and compared 48 hours after intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide or vehicle, using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays.\n\n Target gene induction, identified by microarray analysis, was validated independently using qPCR.\n\n Expression of the same panel of target genes was then investigated in a number of sterile and other TLR-dependent models of peripheral inflammation.\n\n\nResults\nMicroarray analysis of whole brains collected 48 hr after LPS challenge revealed increased transcription of a range of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the brain.\n\n In addition to acute LPS challenge, ISGs were induced in the brain following both chronic LPS-induced systemic inflammation and Imiquimod-induced skin inflammation.\n\n Unique to the brain, this transcriptional response is indicative of peripherally triggered, interferon-mediated CNS inflammation.\n\n Similar models of sterile inflammation and lipoteichoic-acid-induced systemic inflammation did not share the capacity to trigger ISG induction in the brain.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese data highlight ISG induction in the brain as being a consequence of a TLR-induced type I interferon response.\n\n As considerable evidence links type I interferons to

interferon","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Interferon ? (IFN?) is a cytokine whose production is increased endogenously in response to viral infection and in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n An elevated IFN? signature has been associated with clinically observed neuro-behavioural deficits such as mild cognitive impairment, fatigue, depression and psychosis in these diseases.\n\n However, the mechanisms underlying these neuropsychiatric symptoms remain largely unknown, and it is as yet unclear how IFN? signalling might influence central nervous system (CNS) function.\n\n Aberrant microglia-mediated synaptic pruning and function has recently been implicated in several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, but whether and how IFN? modulates these functions are not well defined.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Using a model of peripheral IFN? administration, we investigated gene expression changes due to IFNAR signalling in microglia.\n\n Bulk RNA sequencing on sorted microglia from wild type and microglia-specific Ifnar1 conditional knockout mice was performed to evaluate IFN?

suffer from serious sequelae.\n At present, people are studying the role of the innate immune system in viral encephalitis.\n Microglia, as resident cells of the central nervous system (CNS), can respond quickly to various CNS injuries including trauma, ischemia, and infection and maintain the homeostasis of CNS, but this response is not always good; sometimes, it will exacerbate damage.\n Studies have shown that microglia also act as a double-edged sword during viral encephalitis.\n On the one hand, microglia can sense ATP signals through the purinergic receptor P2Y12 and are recruited around infected neurons to exert phagocytic activity.\n Microglia can exert a direct antiviral effect by producing type 1 interferon (IFN-1) to induce IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression of themselves or indirect antiviral effects by IFN-1 acting on other cells to activate corresponding signaling pathways.\n In addition, microglia can also exert an antiviral effect by inducing autophagy or secreting cytokines.\n On the other hand, microglia mediate presynaptic membrane damage in the hippocampus through complement, resulting in long-term memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction in patients with encephalitis.\n Microglia mediate fetal congenital malformations caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection.\n The gene expression profile of microglia in HIV encephalitis changes, and they tend to be a pro-inflammatory type.\n Microglia inhibited neuronal autophagy and aggravated the damage of CNS in HIV encephalitis; E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino (pelia) expressed by microglia promotes the replication of virus in neurons.\n The interaction between amyloid-? peptide (A?) produced by neurons and activated microglia during viral infection is uncertain.\n Although neurons can mediate antiviral effects by activating receptor-interacting protein kinases 3 (RIPK3) in a death-independent pathway, the RIPK3 pathway of microglia is unknown.\n Different brain regions have different susceptibility to viruses, and the gene expression of microglia in different brain regions is specific.\n The relationship between the two needs to be further confirmed.\n How to properly regulate the

Control of Zika Infection Is Independent of Interferon Type I and Type III Expression","abstract":"Simple Summary\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus first isolated from the Zika forest, Uganda, in 1947, which has been spreading across continents since then.\n\n We now know ZIKV causes both microencephaly in newborns and neurological complications in adults; however, no effective treatment options have yet been found.\n\n A more complete understanding of Zika-infection-mediated pathogenesis and host responses is required to enable the development of novel treatment strategies.\n\n In this study, efforts were made to elucidate the host responses following Zika virus infection using several astrocyte cell models, as astrocytes are a major cell type within the central nervous system (CNS) with significant antiviral ability.\n\n Our data suggest that astrocytes can resist ZIKV both in an interferon type I- and III-independent manner and suggest that an early and more diverse antiviral response may be more effective in controlling Zika infection.\n\n This study also identifies astrocyte cellular models that appear to display differential abilities in the control of viral infection, which may assist in the study of alternate neurotropic virus infections.\n\n Overall, this work adds to the growing body of knowledge surrounding ZIKV-mediated cellular host interactions and will contribute to a better understanding of ZIKV-mediated pathogenesis.\n\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a pathogenic neurotropic virus that infects the central nervous system (CNS) and results in various neurological complications.\n\n Astrocytes are the dominant CNS cell producer of the antiviral cytokine IFN-?, however little is known about the factors involved in their ability to mediate viral infection control.\n\n Recent studies have displayed differential responses in astrocytes to ZIKV infection, and this study sought to elucidate astrocyte cell-specific responses to ZIKV using a variety of cell models infected with either the African (MR766) or Asian (PRVABC59) ZIKV strains.\n\n Expression levels of pro-inflammatory (TNF-? and IL-1?) and inflammatory (IL-8) cytokines following viral infection were low and mostly comparable within the ZIKV-resistant and ZIKV-susceptible astrocyte models, with better control of proinflammatory cytokines displayed in resistant astrocyte cells, synchronising with the viral infection level at specific timepoints.\n\n Astrocyte cell lines displaying ZIKV-resistance also demonstrated early upregulation of multiple antiviral genes compared with susceptible astrocytes.\n\n Interestingly, pre-stimulation of ZIKV-susceptible astrocytes with either poly(I:C) or poly(dA:dT) showed efficient protection against ZIKV compared with pre-stimulation with either recombinant IFN-? or IFN-?, perhaps indicating that a more diverse antiviral gene expression is necessary for astrocyte control of ZIKV, and this is driven in part through interferon-independent mechanisms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8772967","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mithun","surname":"Das","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Monique

(TBEV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) are causative agents of severe brain-related diseases including meningitis, encephalitis, and microcephaly.\n\n We have previously shown that local type I interferon response within the central nervous system (CNS) is involved in the protection of mice against tick-borne flavivirus infection.\n\n However, the cells responsible for mounting this protective response are not defined.\n\n\nMethods\nPrimary astrocytes were isolated from wild-type (WT) and interferon alpha receptor knock out (IFNAR?/?) mice and infected with neurotropic flaviviruses.\n\n Viral replication and spread, IFN induction and response, and cellular viability were analyzed.\n\n Transcriptional levels in primary astrocytes treated with interferon or supernatant from virus-infected cells were analyzed by RNA sequencing and evaluated by different bioinformatics tools.\n\n\nResults\nHere, we show that astrocytes control viral replication of different TBEV strains, JEV, WNV, and ZIKV.\n\n In contrast to fibroblast, astrocytes mount a rapid interferon response and restrict viral spread.\n\n Furthermore, basal expression levels of key interferon-stimulated genes are high in astrocytes compared to mouse embryonic fibroblasts.\n\n Bioinformatic analysis of RNA-sequencing data reveals that astrocytes have established a basal antiviral state which contributes to the rapid viral recognition and upregulation of interferons.\n\n The most highly upregulated pathways in neighboring cells were linked to type I interferon response and innate immunity.\n\n The restriction in viral growth was dependent on interferon signaling, since loss of the interferon receptor, or its blockade in wild-type cells, resulted in high viral replication and virus-induced cytopathic effects.\n\n Astrocyte supernatant from TBEV-infected cells can restrict TBEV growth in astrocytes already 6 h post infection, the effect on neurons is highly reinforced, and astrocyte supernatant from 3 h post infection is already protective.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings suggest that the combination of an intrinsic constitutive antiviral response and the fast induction of type I IFN production by astrocytes play an important role in self-protection of astrocytes and suppression of flavivirus replication in the CNS.\n\n\nElectronic

However, it is unclear whether elevated IFN signaling associated with genetic loss of SAMHD1 would affect SARS-CoV-2 replication.\n In this study, we established in vitro tissue culture model systems for SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus OC43 infections in which SAMHD1 protein expression was absent as a result of CRISPR–Cas9 gene KO or lentiviral viral protein X–mediated proteosomal degradation.\n We show that both SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus OC43 replications were suppressed in SAMHD1 KO 293T and differentiated THP-1 macrophage cell lines.\n Similarly, when SAMHD1 was degraded by virus-like particles in primary monocyte-derived macrophages, we observed lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.\n The loss of SAMHD1 in 293T and differentiated THP-1 cells resulted in upregulated gene expression of IFNs and innate immunity signaling proteins from several pathways, with STAT1 mRNA being the most prominently elevated ones.\n Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 replication was significantly increased in both SAMHD1 WT and KO cells when expression and phosphorylation of STAT1 were downregulated by JAK inhibitor baricitinib, which over-rode the activated antiviral innate immunity in the KO cells.\n This further validates baricitinib as a treatment of SARS-CoV-2–infected patients primarily at the postviral clearance stage.\n Overall, our tissue culture model systems demonstrated that the elevated innate immune response and IFN activation upon genetic loss of SAMHD1 effectively suppresses SARS-CoV-2

(iPSCs) from the dermal fibroblasts of TLR3- and UNC-93B-deficient patients and from controls.\n These iPSCs were differentiated into highly purified populations of neural stem cells (NSCs), neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.\n The induction of IFN-? and/or IFN-?1 in response to poly(I:C) stimulation was dependent on TLR3 and UNC-93B in all cells tested.\n However, the induction of IFN-? and IFN-?1 in response to HSV-1 infection was impaired selectively in UNC-93B-deficient neurons and oligodendrocytes.\n These cells were also much more susceptible to HSV-1 infection than control cells, whereas UNC-93B-deficient NSCs and astrocytes were not.\n TLR3-deficient neurons were also found to be susceptible to HSV-1 infection.\n The rescue of UNC-93B- and TLR3-deficient cells with the corresponding wild-type allele demonstrated that the genetic defect was the cause of the poly(I:C) and HSV-1 phenotypes.\n The viral infection phenotype was further rescued by treatment with exogenous IFN-?/?, but not IFN-?1.Thus, impaired TLR3- and UNC-93B-dependent IFN-?/? intrinsic immunity to HSV-1 in the CNS, in neurons and oligodendrocytes in particular, may underlie the pathogenesis of HSE

forms of Gaucher disease, neuroinflammation is observed.\n\n\nMethods\nAn unbiased gene profile analysis was performed on a severely affected brain area of a neurological form of a Gaucher disease mouse at a pre-symptomatic stage; the mouse used for this study, the Gbaflox/flox; nestin-Cre mouse, was engineered such that GBA1 deficiency is restricted to cells of neuronal lineage, i.\n\ne.\n\n,

Like interferon-?, co-treatment with a combination of ISG15, USP18, and IL-6 was able to reduce neurogenesis and enhance apoptosis via further downstream activation of STAT1. Further experiments showed that ISG15 and USP18 mediated the interferon-?-induced reduction in neurogenesis (potentially through upregulation of the ISGylation-related proteins UBA7, UBE2L6, and HERC5), while IL-6 mediated the interferon-?-induced increase in apoptosis (potentially through downregulation of aquaporin 4).\n\n Using transcriptomic analyses, we showed that interferon-? regulated

for the A-T pathogenesis.\n Although the precise role of ATM in A-T pathogenesis is still unclear, its function in responding to DNA damage has been well established.\n Here we demonstrate that in addition to its role in DNA repair, ATM also regulates proteasome-mediated protein turnover through suppression of the ISG15 pathway.\n This conclusion is based on three major pieces of evidence: First, we demonstrate that proteasome-mediated protein degradation is impaired in A-T cells.\n Second, we show that the reduced protein turnover is causally linked to the elevated expression of the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 in A-T cells.\n Third, we show that expression of the ISG15 is elevated in A-T cells derived from various A-T patients, as well as in brain tissues derived from the ATM knockout mice and A-T patients, suggesting that ATM negatively regulates the ISG15 pathway.\n Our current findings suggest for the first time that proteasome-mediated protein degradation is impaired in A-T cells due to elevated expression of the ISG15 conjugation pathway, which could contribute to progressive neurodegeneration in A-T

We observed distinct patterns of IFITM-mediated restriction: compared with IAV, the entry processes of MARV and EBOV were less restricted by IFITM3, but more restricted by IFITM1. Moreover, murine Ifitm5 and 6 did not restrict IAV, but efficiently inhibited filovirus entry.\n We further demonstrate that replication of infectious SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and entry mediated by the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein are restricted by IFITM proteins.\n The profile of IFITM-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV was more similar to that of filoviruses than to IAV.\n Trypsin treatment of receptor-associated SARS-CoV pseudovirions, which bypasses their dependence on lysosomal cathepsin L, also bypassed IFITM-mediated restriction.\n However, IFITM proteins did not reduce cellular cathepsin activity or limit access of virions to acidic intracellular compartments.\n Our data indicate that IFITM-mediated restriction is localized to a late stage in the endocytic pathway.\n They further show that IFITM proteins differentially restrict the entry of a broad range of enveloped viruses, and modulate cellular tropism independently of viral receptor expression.\n","id":"PMC3017121","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"I-Chueh","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charles C.","surname":"Bailey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jessica L.","surname":"Weyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sheli R.","surname":"Radoshitzky","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michelle M.","surname":"Becker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jessica J.","surname":"Chiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abraham L.","surname":"Brass","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Asim A.","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoli","surname":"Chi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lian","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lindsay E.","surname":"Longobardi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dutch","surname":"Boltz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jens H.","surname":"Kuhn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephen J.","surname":"Elledge","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sina","surname":"Bavari","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark R.","surname":"Denison","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hyeryun","surname":"Choe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Farzan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.00655-16","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The interferon-stimulated gene IFITM3 restricts infection and pathogenesis of arthritogenic and encephalitic alphaviruses","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature10921","date":"1970-01-01","title":"IFITM3 restricts the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza","abstract":"","id":"PMC3648786","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Aaron R.","surname":"Everitt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Clare","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Pertel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sinu P.","surname":"John","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rachael S.","surname":"Wash","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sarah E.","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher R.","surname":"Chin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric M.","surname":"Feeley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jennifer S.","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David J.","surname":"Adams","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Helen M.","surname":"Wise","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leanne","surname":"Kane","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Goulding","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Digard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Verneri","surname":"Anttila","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in

COVID-19-Associated ATM and 3 Post-Vaccination ATM Serious Adverse Events With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccine (AZD1222)","abstract":"Introduction\nAlthough acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is a rare neurological condition (1.34-4.6 cases per million/year) COVID-19-associated ATM cases have occurred during the pandemic.\n\n\nCase-finding methods\nWe report a patient from Panama with SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by ATM and present a comprehensive clinical review of 43 patients with COVID-19-associated ATM from 21 countries published from March 2020 to January 2021. In addition, 3 cases of ATM were reported as serious adverse events during the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222).\n\n\nResults\nAll patients had typical features of ATM with acute onset of paralysis, sensory level and sphincter deficits due to spinal cord lesions demonstrated by imaging.\n\n There were 23 males (53%) and 20 females (47%) ranging from ages 21- to 73- years-old (mean age, 49 years), with two peaks at 29 and 58 years, excluding 3 pediatric cases.\n\n The main clinical manifestations were quadriplegia (58%) and paraplegia (42%).\n\n MRI reports were available in 40 patients; localized ATM lesions affected ?3 cord segments (12 cases, 30%) at cervical (5 cases) and thoracic cord levels (7 cases); 28 cases (70%) had longitudinally-extensive ATM (LEATM) involving ?4 spinal cord segments (cervicothoracic in 18 cases and thoracolumbar-sacral in 10 patients).\n\n Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) occurred in 8 patients, mainly women (67%) ranging from 27- to 64-years-old.\n\n Three ATM patients also had blindness from myeloneuritis optica (MNO) and two more also had acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN).\n\n\nConclusions\nWe found ATM to be an unexpectedly frequent neurological complication of COVID-19. Most cases (68%) had a latency of 10 days to 6 weeks that may indicate post-infectious neurological complications mediated by the host’s response to the virus.\n\n In 32% a brief latency (15 hours to 5 days) suggested a direct neurotropic effect of SARS-CoV-2.

reported during the current COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that infection with SARS-CoV-2 affects the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the muscle.\n CNS manifestations include: headache and decreased responsiveness considered initial indicators of potential neurological involvement; anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and dysgeusia are frequent early symptoms of coronavirus infection.\n Respiratory failure, the lethal manifestation of COVID-19, responsible for 264,679 deaths worldwide, is probably neurogenic in origin and may result from the viral invasion of cranial nerve I, progressing into rhinencephalon and brainstem respiratory centers.\n Cerebrovascular disease, in particular large-vessel ischemic strokes, and less frequently cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually occur as part of a thrombotic state induced by viral attachment to ACE2 receptors in endothelium causing widespread endotheliitis, coagulopathy, arterial and venous thromboses.\n Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy is associated to the cytokine storm.\n A frontal hypoperfusion syndrome has been identified.\n There are isolated reports of seizures, encephalopathy, meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis.\n The neurological diseases affecting the PNS and muscle in COVID-19 are less frequent and include Guillain-Barré syndrome; Miller Fisher syndrome; polyneuritis cranialis; and rare instances of viral myopathy with rhabdomyolysis.\n The main conclusion of this review is the pressing need to define the neurology of COVID-19, its frequency, manifestations, neuropathology and pathogenesis.\n On behalf of the World Federation of Neurology we invite national and regional neurological associations to create local databases to report cases with neurological manifestations observed during the on-going pandemic.\n International neuroepidemiological collaboration may help define the

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alters barrier function in 2D static and 3D microfluidic in-vitro models of the human blood–brain barrier","abstract":"As researchers across the globe have focused their attention on understanding SARS-CoV-2, the picture that is emerging is that of a virus that has serious effects on the vasculature in multiple organ systems including the cerebral vasculature.\n Observed effects on the central nervous system include neurological symptoms (headache, nausea, dizziness), fatal microclot formation and in rare cases encephalitis.\n However, our understanding of how the virus causes these mild to severe neurological symptoms and how the cerebral vasculature is impacted remains unclear.\n Thus, the results presented in this report explored whether deleterious outcomes from the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) could be observed.\n The spike protein, which plays a key role in receptor recognition, is formed by the S1 subunit containing a receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S2 subunit.\n First, using postmortem brain tissue, we show that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 (a known binding target for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), is ubiquitously expressed throughout various vessel calibers in the frontal cortex.\n Moreover, ACE2 expression was upregulated in cases of hypertension and dementia.\n ACE2 was also detectable in primary hBMVECs maintained under cell culture conditions.\n Analysis of cell viability revealed that neither the S1, S2 or a truncated form of the S1 containing only the RBD had minimal effects on hBMVEC viability within a 48 h exposure window.\n Introduction of spike proteins to invitro models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) showed significant changes to barrier properties.\n Key to our findings is the demonstration that S1 promotes loss of barrier integrity in an advanced 3D microfluidic model of the human BBB, a platform that more closely resembles the physiological conditions at this CNS interface.\n Evidence provided suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins trigger a pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells that may contribute to an altered state of BBB function.\n Together, these results are the first to show the direct impact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could have on brain endothelial cells; thereby offering a plausible explanation for the neurological consequences seen in COVID-19 patients.\n","id":"PMC7547916","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tetyana P.","surname":"Buzhdygan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Brandon

coronavirus named SARS?CoV?2 (previously known as 2019?nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world.\n This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS?CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS?CoV and MERS?CoV.\n The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID?19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously.\n Additionally, some patients with COVID?19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases.\n The infection of SARS?CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected.\n Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse?connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways.\n Considering the high similarity between SARS?CoV and SARS?CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS?CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID?19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS?CoV?2?induced respiratory failure.\n","id":"PMC7228394","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan?Chao","surname":"Li","email":"liyanchao@jlu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tsutomu","surname":"Hashikawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.abb2507","date":"2020-02-17","title":"Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation","abstract":"The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to be a public health emergency of international concern.\n The virus binds to host cells through its trimeric spike glycoprotein, making this protein a key target for potential therapies and diagnostics.\n Wrapp et al.\n determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the 2019-nCoV trimeric spike protein by cryo–electron microscopy.\n Using biophysical assays, the authors show that this protein binds at least 10 times more tightly than the corresponding spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–CoV to their common host cell receptor.\n They also tested three antibodies known to bind to the SARS-CoV spike protein but did not detect binding to the 2019-nCoV spike protein.\n These studies provide valuable information to guide the development of medical counter-measures for 2019-nCoV.\n","id":"PMC7164637","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Wrapp","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nianshuang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nianshuang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kizzmekia S.","surname":"Corbett","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kizzmekia S.","surname":"Corbett","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jory A.","surname":"Goldsmith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jory A.","surname":"Goldsmith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ching-Lin","surname":"Hsieh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Olubukola","surname":"Abiona","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Barney S.","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Barney S.","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jason S.","surname":"McLellan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jason S.","surname":"McLellan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1021/acschemneuro.6b00197","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis: Neurochemotaxis and Neurotropic Preferences of Naegleria fowleri","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.1111/ene.14273","date":"2020-04-16","title":"Acute?onset smell and taste disorders in the context of COVID?19: a pilot multicentre polymerase chain reaction based case–control study","abstract":"Background and purpose\nSpecific respiratory tract infections, including COVID?19, may cause smell and/or taste disorders (STDs) with increased frequency.\n\n The aim was to determine whether new?onset STDs are more frequent amongst COVID?19 patients than influenza patients.\n\n\nMethod\nThis was a case–control study including hospitalized patients of two tertiary care centres.\n\n Consecutive patients positive for COVID?19 polymerase chain reaction (cases) and patients positive for influenza polymerase chain reaction (historical control sample) were assessed during specific periods, employing a self?reported STD questionnaire.\n\n\nResults\nSeventy?nine cases and 40 controls were included.\n\n No significant differences were found in basal features between the two groups.\n\n New?onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst cases (31, 39.2%) than in the control group (5, 12.5 %) [adjusted odds ratio 21.4 (2.77–165.4, P = 0.003)].\n\n COVID?19 patients with new?onset STDs were significantly younger than COVID?19 patients without STDs (52.6 ± 17.2 vs.\n\n 67.4 ± 15.1, P &lt; 0.001).\n\n Amongst COVID?19 patients who presented STDs, 22 (70.9%) recalled an acute onset and it was an initial manifestation in 11 (35.5%).\n\n Twenty?five (80.6%) presented smell disorders (mostly anosmia, 14, 45.2%) and 28 (90.3%) taste disorders (mostly ageusia, 14, 45.2%).\n\n Only four (12.9 %) reported concomitant nasal obstruction.\n\n The mean duration of STD was 7.5 ± 3.2 days and 12 patients (40%) manifested complete recovery after 7.4 ± 2.3 days of onset.\n\n\nConclusion\nNew?onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst COVID?19 patients than influenza patients;

immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but gained little information on the organ distribution of SARS?associated coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS?CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS?CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS?CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS.\n SARS?CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle.\n These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS?CoV may also be targets of SARS?CoV infection.\n The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS?CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection.\n In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS?CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission.\n This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS?CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways.\n This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS.\n Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n

respiratory tract infection.\n\n In recent years the importance of extrapulmonary manifestations of RSV infection has become evident.\n\n This systematic review aimed at summarizing the available evidence on manifestations of RSV infection outside the respiratory tract, their causes and the changes in clinical management required.\n\n\nMethods\nDatabases searched were Medline (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), PubMed and reference lists of relevant articles.\n\n Summarized were the findings of articles reporting on manifestations of RSV infection outside the respiratory tract in patients of all age groups.\n\n\nResults\nExtrapulmonary manifestations reported in previous observational studies included cardiovascular failure with hypotension and inotrope requirements associated with myocardial damage as evident from elevated cardiac troponin levels (35–54% of ventilated infants), cardiac arrhythmias like supraventricular tachycardias and ventricular tachycardias, central apnoeas (16–21% of admissions), focal and generalized seizures, focal neurological abnormalities, hyponatraemia (33%) associated with increased antidiuretic hormone secretion, and hepatitis (46–49% of ventilated infants).\n\n RSV or its genetic material have been isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, myocardium, liver and peripheral blood.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe data summarized indicate a systemic dissemination of RSV during severe disease.\n\n Cerebral and myocardial involvement may explain the association of RSV with some cases of sudden infant death.\n\n In infants with severe RSV

regarding heart function in infants with bronchiolitis associated with RSV infection have yet been systematically collected.\n\n The aim of this study was to verify the real frequency of heart involvement in patients with bronchiolitis associated with RSV infection, and whether infants with mild or moderate disease also risk heart malfunction.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 69 otherwise healthy infants aged 1-12 months with bronchiolitis hospitalised in standard wards were enrolled.\n\n Pernasal flocked swabs were performed to collect specimens for the detection of RSV by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and a blood sample was drawn to assess troponin I concentrations.\n\n On the day of admission, all of the infants underwent 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring and a complete heart evaluation with echocardiography.\n\n Patients were re-evaluated by investigators blinded to the etiological and cardiac findings four weeks after enrolment.\n\n\nResults\nRegardless of their clinical presentation, sinoatrial blocks were identified in 26/34 RSV-positive patients (76.5%) and 1/35 RSV-negative patients (2.9%) (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n The blocks recurred more than three times over 24 hours in 25/26 RSV-positive patients (96.2%) and none of the RSV-negative infants.\n\n Mean and maximum heart rates were significantly higher in the RSV-positive infants (p &lt; 0.05), as was low-frequency power and the low and high-frequency power ratio (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n The blocks were significantly more frequent in the children with an RSV load of ?100,000 copies/mL than in those with a lower viral load (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Holter ECG after 28 ± 3 days showed the complete regression of the heart abnormalities.\n\n\nConclusions\nRSV seems associated with sinoatrial blocks and transient rhythm alterations even when the related respiratory problems are mild or moderate.\n\n Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of these rhythm problems and whether they remain asymptomatic and transient even in presence of severe respiratory involvement or chronic underlying disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2987303","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Susanna","surname":"Esposito","email":"susanna.esposito@unimi.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrizia","surname":"Salice","email":"cardioped@unimi.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samantha","surname":"Bosis","email":"Samantha.bosis@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Silvia","surname":"Ghiglia","email":"silvia.ghiglia@policlinico.mi.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elena","surname":"Tremolati","email":"elena.tremolati@tiscali.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claudia","surname":"Tagliabue","email":"hollie1979@yahoo.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Gualtieri","email":"laura.axxl@libero.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Barbier","email":"paolo.barbier@cardiologicomonzino.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carlotta","surname":"Galeone","email":"carlotta.galeone@marionegri.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paola","surname":"Marchisio","email":"paola.marchisio@unimi.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Principi","email":"nicola.principi@unimi.it","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid2111.150608","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Encephalitis-Associated

roniviruses, which possess the largest known RNA genomes (from 26 to 32 kb) and will therefore be called ‘large’ nidoviruses in this review.\n They are compared with their arterivirus cousins, which also belong to the Nidovirales despite having a much smaller genome (13–16 kb).\n Common and unique features that have been identified for either large or all nidoviruses are outlined.\n These include the nidovirus genetic plan and genome diversity, the composition of the replicase machinery and virus particles, virus-specific accessory genes, the mechanisms of RNA and protein synthesis, and the origin and evolution of nidoviruses with small and large genomes.\n Nidoviruses employ single-stranded, polycistronic RNA genomes of positive polarity that direct the synthesis of the subunits of the replicative complex, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase.\n Replicase gene expression is under the principal control of a ribosomal frameshifting signal and a chymotrypsin-like protease, which is assisted by one or more papain-like proteases.\n A nested set of subgenomic RNAs is synthesized to express the 3?-proximal ORFs that encode most conserved structural proteins and, in some large nidoviruses, also diverse accessory proteins that may promote virus adaptation to specific hosts.\n The replicase machinery includes a set of RNA-processing enzymes some of which are unique for either all or large nidoviruses.\n The acquisition of these enzymes may have improved the low fidelity of RNA replication to allow genome expansion and give rise to the ancestors of small and, subsequently, large nidoviruses.\n","id":"PMC7114179","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander

explore the cytokine expression profiles in hospitalized children with CoV-CNS and CoV-respiratory tract infections.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 183 and 236 hospitalized children with acute encephalitis-like syndrome and respiratory tract infection, respectively, were screened for anti-CoV IgM antibodies.\n\n The expression profiles of multiple cytokines were determined in CoV-positive patients.\n\n\nResults\nAnti-CoV IgM antibodies were detected in 22/183 (12.02%) and 26/236 (11.02%) patients with acute encephalitis-like syndrome and respiratory tract infection, respectively.\n\n Cytokine analysis revealed that the level of serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was significantly higher in both CoV-CNS and CoV-respiratory tract infection compared with healthy controls.\n\n Additionally, the serum level of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was significantly higher in CoV-CNS infection than in CoV-respiratory tract infection.\n\n In patients with CoV-CNS infection, the levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and GM-CSF were significantly higher in their cerebrospinal fluid samples than in matched serum samples.\n\n\nConclusion\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing a high incidence of CoV infection in hospitalized children, especially with CNS illness.\n\n The characteristic cytokine expression profiles in CoV infection indicate the importance of host immune response in disease progression.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7179523","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yuanyuan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haipeng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruyan","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Wen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chengwu","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhanyi","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuochi","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojie","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinjun","surname":"Lv","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaowang","surname":"Qu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Renbin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenpei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/jvi.00143-15","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Viral

rare case of RSV encephalopathy in an infant who presented with poor sucking and hypothermia at 17 days of age after suffering from rhinorrhea and a cough for several days.\n After hospitalization, the patient presented with stupor and hypotonia lasting for at least 24 h, and was intubated, sedated, and ventilated for treatment of pneumonia.\n These symptoms led to diagnosis of pediatric systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by RSV infection.\n High-dose steroid therapy was combined with artificial ventilation because the initial ventilation therapy was ineffective.\n Interleukin (IL)-6 levels in spinal fluid were markedly increased upon admission, and serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels showed even greater elevation.\n The patient was diagnosed with RSV encephalopathy.\n On day 5, high signal intensity in the bilateral hippocampus was observed on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n On day 14, the patient presented with delayed partial seizure and an electroencephalogram showed occasional unilateral spikes in the parietal area, but the hippocampal abnormality had improved to normal on MRI.\n 99mTc-labeled ethylcysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) on day 18 showed hypoperfusion of the bilateral frontal and parietal regions and the unilateral temporal region.\n SPECT at 3 months after onset still showed hypoperfusion of the bilateral frontal region and unilateral temporal region, but hypoperfusion of the bilateral parietal region had improved.\n The patient has no neurological deficit at 6 months.\n

including people acutely infected with the pandemic A/California/04/2009 (CA/09) H1N1 virus.\n Based on previous studies showing that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 virus was neurotropic, induced CNS inflammation and a transient parkinsonism, we examined the neurotropic and inflammatory potential of the CA/09 H1N1 virus in mice.\n Following intranasal inoculation, we found no evidence for CA/09 H1N1 virus neurotropism in the enteric, peripheral or central nervous systems.\n We did, however, observe a robust increase in microglial activity in the brain characterized by an increase in the number of activated Iba-1-positive microglia in the substantia nigra (SN) and the hippocampus, despite the absence of virus in the brain.\n qPCR analysis in SN tissue showed that the induction of microgliosis was preceded by reduced gene expression of the neurotrophic factors bdnf, and gdnf and increases in the immune modulatory chemokine chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (ccl4).\n We also noted changes in the expression of transforming growth factor-1 (tgf?1) in the SN starting at 7 days post-infection (dpi) that was sustained through 21 dpi, coupled with increases in arginase-1 (arg1) and csf1, M2 markers for microglia.\n Given that neuroinflammation contributes to generation and progression of a number of neurodegenerative disorders, these findings have significant implications as they highlight the possibility that influenza and perhaps other non-neurotropic viruses can initiate inflammatory signals via microglia activation in the brain and contribute to, but not necessarily be the primary cause of, neurodegenerative

or acquired new neurovirulence properties.\n Mosquito-borne viruses with expanding ranges include West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and Chikungunya virus.\n Zoonotic viruses that have recently crossed into humans to cause neurologic disease include the bat henipaviruses Nipah and Hendra, as well as the primate-derived human immunodeficiency virus.\n Viruses adapt to new hosts, or to cause more severe disease, by changing their genomes through reassortment (e.\ng.\n influenza virus), mutation (essentially all RNA viruses) and recombination (e.\ng.\n vaccine strains of poliovirus).\n Viruses that appear to have recently become more neurovirulent include West Nile virus, enterovirus 71 and possibly Chikungunya virus.\n In addition to these newer challenges, rabies, polio and measles all remain important causes of neurologic disease despite good vaccines and global efforts toward control.\n Control of human rabies depends on elimination of rabies in domestic dogs through regular vaccination.\n Poliovirus eradication is challenged by the ability of the live attenuated vaccine strains to revert to virulence during the prolonged period of gastrointestinal replication.\n Measles elimination depends on delivery of two doses of live virus vaccine to a high enough proportion of the population to maintain herd immunity for this highly infectious

Chikungunya: Young Age and Inefficient Type-I Interferon Signaling Are Risk Factors for Severe Disease","abstract":"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging arbovirus responsible for a massive outbreak currently afflicting the Indian Ocean region and India.\n Infection from CHIKV typically induces a mild disease in humans, characterized by fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash.\n Cases of severe CHIKV infection involving the central nervous system (CNS) have recently been described in neonates as well as in adults with underlying conditions.\n The pathophysiology of CHIKV infection and the basis for disease severity are unknown.\n To address these critical issues, we have developed an animal model of CHIKV infection.\n We show here that whereas wild type (WT) adult mice are resistant to CHIKV infection, WT mouse neonates are susceptible and neonatal disease severity is age-dependent.\n Adult mice with a partially (IFN-?/?R+/?) or totally (IFN-?/?R?/?) abrogated type-I IFN pathway develop a mild or severe infection, respectively.\n In mice with a mild infection, after a burst of viral replication in the liver, CHIKV primarily targets muscle, joint, and skin fibroblasts, a cell and tissue tropism similar to that observed in biopsy samples of CHIKV-infected humans.\n In case of severe infections, CHIKV also disseminates to other tissues including the CNS, where it specifically targets the choroid plexuses and the leptomeninges.\n Together, these data indicate that CHIKV-associated symptoms match viral tissue and cell tropisms, and demonstrate that the fibroblast is a predominant target cell of CHIKV.\n These data also identify the neonatal phase and inefficient type-I IFN signaling as risk factors for severe CHIKV-associated disease.\n The development of a permissive small animal model will expedite the testing of future vaccines and therapeutic candidates.\n","id":"PMC2242832","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thérèse","surname":"Couderc","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fabrice","surname":"Chrétien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Clémentine","surname":"Schilte","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Olivier","surname":"Disson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Madly","surname":"Brigitte","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Florence","surname":"Guivel-Benhassine","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yasmina","surname":"Touret","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Georges","surname":"Barau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nadège","surname":"Cayet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Isabelle","surname":"Schuffenecker","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Desprès","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fernando","surname":"Arenzana-Seisdedos","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alain","surname":"Michault","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew

occurs in severe human influenza A/H5N1 viral infection but is not known to occur commonly in seasonal human influenza infection.\n\n Recently, viral RNA was detected in the blood of patients suffering from severe pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 viral infection, although the significance of viremia had not been previously studied.\n\n Our study aims to explore the clinical and virological factors associated with pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 viremia and to determine its clinical significance.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nClinical data of patients admitted to hospitals in Hong Kong between May 2009 and April 2010 and tested positive for pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 was collected.\n\n Viral RNA was detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) targeting the matrix (M) and HA genes of pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 virus from the following specimens: nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), endotracheal aspirate (ETA), blood, stool and rectal swab.\n\n Stool and/ or rectal swab was obtained only if the patient complained of any gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n A total of 139 patients were included in the study, with viral RNA being detected in the blood of 14 patients by RT-PCR.\n\n The occurrence of viremia was strongly associated with a severe clinical presentation and a higher mortality rate, although the latter association was not statistically significant.\n\n D222G/N quasispecies were observed in 90% of the blood samples.\n\n\nConclusion\nPresence of pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 viremia is an indicator of disease severity and strongly associated with D222G/N mutation in the viral hemagglutinin protein.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3181248","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Herman","surname":"Tse","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelvin K.

death.\n The pathogenesis of HeV infection is poorly understood, and the lack of a mouse model has limited the opportunities for pathogenetic research.\n In this project we reassessed the role of mice as an animal model for HeV infection and found that mice are susceptible to HeV infection after intranasal exposure, with aged mice reliably developing encephalitic disease.\n We propose an anterograde route of neuroinvasion to the brain, possibly along olfactory nerves.\n This is supported by evidence for the development of encephalitis in the absence of viremia and the sequential distribution of viral antigen along pathways of olfaction in the brain of intranasally challenged animals.\n In our studies mice developed transient lower respiratory tract infection without progressing to viremia and systemic vasculitis that is common to other animal models.\n These studies report a new animal model of HeV encephalitis that will allow more detailed studies of the neuropathogenesis of HeV infection, particularly the mode of viral spread and possible sequestration within the central nervous system; investigation of mechanisms that moderate the development of viremia and systemic disease; and inform the development of improved treatment options for human

can be responsible for CNS disease through a variety of mechanisms including direct infection and replication within the CNS resulting in encephalitis, infection limited to the meninges, or immune-related processes such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.\n Common pathogens including herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster, and enterovirus are responsible for the greatest number of cases in immunocompetent hosts.\n Other herpes viruses (eg, cytomegalovirus, John Cunningham virus) are more common in immunocompromised hosts.\n Arboviruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus and

Sequelae Resulting from Encephalitic Alphavirus Infection","abstract":"The recent surge in viral clinical cases and associated neurological deficits have reminded us that viral infections can lead to detrimental, long-term effects, termed sequelae, in survivors.\n Alphaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses in the Togaviridae family.\n Transmission of alphaviruses between and within species occurs mainly via the bite of an infected mosquito bite, giving alphaviruses a place among arboviruses, or arthropod-borne viruses.\n Alphaviruses are found throughout the world and typically cause arthralgic or encephalitic disease in infected humans.\n Originally detected in the 1930s, today the major encephalitic viruses include Venezuelan, Western, and Eastern equine encephalitis viruses (VEEV, WEEV, and EEEV, respectively).\n VEEV, WEEV, and EEEV are endemic to the Americas and are important human pathogens, leading to thousands of human infections each year.\n Despite awareness of these viruses for nearly 100 years, we possess little mechanistic understanding regarding the complications (sequelae) that emerge after resolution of acute infection.\n Neurological sequelae are those complications involving damage to the central nervous system that results in cognitive, sensory, or motor deficits that may also manifest as emotional instability and seizures in the most severe cases.\n This article serves to provide an overview of clinical cases documented in the past century as well as a summary of the reported neurological sequelae due to VEEV, WEEV, and EEEV infection.\n We conclude with a treatise on the utility of, and practical considerations for animal models applied to the problem of neurological sequelae of viral encephalopathies in

causative pathogen in central nervous system (CNS) infections is crucial for patient management and prognosis.\n Many viruses can cause CNS infections, yet screening for each individually is costly and time-consuming.\n Most metagenomic assays can theoretically detect all pathogens, but often fail to detect viruses because of their small genome and low viral load.\n Viral metagenomics overcomes this by enrichment of the viral genomic content in a sample.\n VIDISCA-NGS is one of the available workflows for viral metagenomics, which requires only a small input volume and allows multiplexing of multiple samples per run.\n The performance of VIDISCA-NGS was tested on 45 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected CNS infections in which a virus was identified and quantified by polymerase chain reaction.\n Eighteen were positive for an RNA virus, and 34 for a herpesvirus.\n VIDISCA-NGS detected all RNA viruses with a viral load &gt;2 × 104 RNA copies/mL (n = 6) and 8 of 12 of the remaining low load samples.\n Only one herpesvirus was identified by VIDISCA-NGS, however, when withholding a DNase treatment, 11 of 18 samples with a herpesvirus load &gt;104 DNA copies/mL were detected.\n Our results indicate that VIDISCA-NGS has the capacity to detect low load RNA viruses in CSF.\n Herpesvirus DNA in clinical samples is probably non-encapsidated and therefore difficult to detect by VIDISCA-NGS.\n","id":"PMC6562652","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Arthur W.

coexist and lead to serious sequelae.\n Known aetiologies include infections and immune-mediated processes.\n Despite advances in clinical microbiology over the past decades, the cause of acute CNS inflammation remains unknown in approximately 50% of cases.\n High-throughput sequencing was performed to search for viral sequences in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from 26 patients considered to have acute CNS inflammation of unknown origin, and 10 patients with defined causes of CNS diseases.\n In order to better grasp the clinical significance of viral sequence data obtained in CSF, 30 patients without CNS disease who had a lumbar puncture performed during elective spinal anaesthesia were also analysed.\n One case of human astrovirus (HAstV)-MLB2-related meningitis and disseminated infection was identified.\n No other viral sequences that can easily be linked to CNS inflammation were detected.\n Viral sequences obtained in all patient groups are discussed.\n While some of them reflect harmless viral infections, others result from reagent or sample contamination, as well as index hopping.\n Altogether, this study highlights the potential of high-throughput

unknown.\n\n We aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from episodes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) due to RSV in children younger than 5 years in 2005.\nMethods\nWe estimated the incidence of RSV-associated ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality ratios with incidence estimates from hospital-based reports from published and unpublished studies and identifying studies with population-based data for RSV seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2005, an estimated 33·8 (95% CI 19·3–46·2) million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years (22% of ALRI episodes), with at least 3·4 (2·8–4·3) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission.\n\n We estimated that 66?000–199?000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV-associated ALRI in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries.\n\n Incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year in any one setting.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGlobally, RSV is the most common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of admission to hospital as a result of severe ALRI.\n\n Mortality data suggest that RSV is an important cause of death in childhood from ALRI, after pneumococcal pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae type b.\n\n The development of novel prevention and treatment strategies should be accelerated as a priority.\n\n\nFunding\nWHO; Bill &amp; Melinda Gates

belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and cause acute respiratory illness often during local outbreaks or seasonal epidemics and occasionally during pandemics.\n Recent studies have identified a new genus within the Orthomyxoviridae family.\n This newly identified pathogen, D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK), first identified in pigs with influenza-like illness was classified as the influenza D virus (IDV) which is distantly related to the previously characterized human influenza C virus.\n Several other back-to-back studies soon suggested cattle as the natural reservoir and possible involvement of IDV in the bovine respiratory disease complex was established.\n Not much is known about its likelihood to cause disease in humans, but it definitely poses a potential threat as an emerging pathogen in cattle-workers.\n Here, we review the evolution, epidemiology, virology and pathobiology of influenza D virus and the possibility of transmission among various hosts and potential to cause human

most influenza infections are self-limited, few other diseases exert such a huge toll of suffering and economic loss.\n Despite the importance of influenza, there had been, until recently, little

in children of live influenza-virus vaccines.\n There have been many new developments in vaccine technology.\n Moreover, work on viral neuraminidase has led to the licensing of potent selective antiviral drugs, and economic decision modelling provides further justification for annual vaccination and a framework for the use of neuraminidase inhibitors.\n Progress has also been made on developing near-patient testing for influenza that may assist individual diagnosis or the recognition of widespread virus circulation, and so optimise clinical management.\n Despite these advances, the occurrence of avian H5N1, H9N2, and H7N7 influenza in human beings and the rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome are reminders of our vulnerability to an emerging pandemic.\n The contrast between recent cases of H5N1 infection, associated with high mortality, and the typically mild, self-limiting nature of human infections with avian H7N7 and H9N2 influenza shows the gaps in our understanding of molecular correlates of pathogenicity and underlines the need for continuing international research into pandemic influenza.\n Improvements in animal and human surveillance,

2004–2005, 47 (5.7%) patients with acute respiratory infection associated with human coronavirus (hCoV) 229E?, NL63?, and OC43?like strains were identified among 823 (597 immunocompetent and 226 immunocompromised) patients admitted to hospital with acute respiratory syndromes.\n Viral infections were diagnosed by either immunological (monoclonal antibodies) or molecular (RT?PCR) methods.\n Each of two sets of primer pairs developed for detection of all CoVs (panCoV) failed to detect 15 of the 53 (28.3%) hCoV strains identified.\n On the other hand, all hCoV strains could be detected by using type?specific primers targeting genes 1ab and N.\n The HuH?7 cell line was found to be susceptible to isolation and identification of OC43? and 229E?like strains.\n Overall, hCoV infection was caused by OC43?like, 229E?like, and NL63?like strains in 25 (53.2%), 10 (21.3%), and 9 (19.1%) patients, respectively.\n In addition, three patients (6.4%) were infected by untypeable hCoV strains.\n NL63?like strains were not found to circulate in 2003–2004, and 229E?like strains did not circulate in 2004–2005, while OC43?like strains were detected in both seasons.\n The monthly distribution reached a peak during January through March.\n Lower predominated over upper respiratory tract infections in each age group.\n In addition, hCoV infections interested only immunocompetent infants and

observed in 14 of the 47 (29.8%) patients and were associated with severe respiratory syndromes more frequently than hCoV single infections (P?=?0.002).\n In conclusion, the use of multiple primer sets targeting different genes is recommended for diagnosis of all types of hCoV infection.\n In addition, the detection of still untypeable hCoV strains suggests that the number of hCoVs involved in human pathology might further increase.\n Finally, hCoVs should be screened routinely for in both infants and immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory infection.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n

Different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses, but it is not clear which are most suitable.\n Therefore, this review compares animal models of SARS and influenza, with an emphasis on non-human primates, ferrets and cats.\n Firstly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza are compared.\n Both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles.\n Important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra-alveolar fibrosis in SARS and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in H5N1 influenza.\n Secondly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza in man and experimental animals are compared.\n Host species, host age, route of inoculation, location of sampling and timing of sampling are important to design an animal model that most closely mimics human disease.\n The

considered an ideal example of the One Health concept.\n This is due to the animals, especially dromedary camels, play important roles in the transmission and sustainability of the virus, and the virus can be transmitted through aerosols of infected patients into the environment.\n However, there is some debate regarding the origin of MERS-CoV either from bats or other unknown reservoirs.\n The dromedary camel is the only identified animal reservoir to date.\n These animals play important roles in sustaining the virus in certain communities and may act as an amplifier of the virus by secreting it in their body fluids, especially in nasal and rectal discharges.\n MERS-CoV has been detected in the nasal and rectal secretions of infected camels, and MERS-CoV of this origin has full capacity to infect human airway epithelium in both in vitro and in vivo models.\n Other evidence confirms the direct transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans, though the role of camel meat and milk products has yet to be well studied.\n Human-to-human transmission is well documented through contact with an active infected patient or some silently infected persons.\n Furthermore, there are some significant risk factors of individuals in close contact with a positive MERS-CoV patient, including sleeping in the same patient room, removing patient waste (urine, stool, and sputum), and touching respiratory secretions from the index case.\n Outbreaks within family clusters have been reported, whereby some blood relative patients were infected through their wives in the same house were not infected.\n Some predisposing genetic factors favor MERS-CoV infection in some patients, which is worth investigating in the near future.\n The presence of other comorbidities may be another factor.\n Overall, there are many unknown/confirmed aspects of the virus/human/animal network.\n Here, the most recent advances in this context are discussed, and the possible reasons behind the emergence and sustainability of MERS-CoV in certain regions are presented.\n Identification of the exact mechanism of transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans and searching for new reservoir/s are of high priority.\n This will reduce the shedding of the virus into the environment, and thus the risk of human infection can be mitigated.\n","id":"PMC6708572","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maged

MERS-CoV hospital outbreaks in KSA, continuing to the present day, and the disease has a mortality rate in excess of 35%.\n Since 2012, the World Health Organization has been informed of 2220

their role in disease remains uncertain.\n The objective of our prospective study was to investigate HCoVs associations with various clinical presentations in hospitalized children up to 6 years of age.\n Children hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis (AB), acute gastroenteritis (AGE), or febrile seizures (FS), and children admitted for elective surgical procedures (healthy controls) were included in the study.\n In patients with AB, AGE, and FS, a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and blood sample were obtained upon admission and the follow-up visit 14 days later, whereas in children with AGE a stool sample was also acquired upon admission; in healthy controls a NP swab and stool sample were taken upon admission.\n Amplification of polymerase 1b gene was used to detect HCoVs in the specimens.\n HCoVs-positive specimens were also examined for the presence of several other viruses.\n HCoVs were most often detected in children with FS (19/192, 9.9%, 95% CI: 6–15%), followed by children with AGE (19/218, 8.7%, 95% CI: 5.3–13.3%) and AB (20/308, 6.5%, 95% CI: 4.0–9.8%).\n The presence of other viruses was a common finding, most frequent in the group of children with AB (19/20, 95%, 95% CI: 75.1–99.8%), followed by FS (10/19, 52.6%, 95% CI: 28.9–75.6%) and AGE (7/19, 36.8%, 95% CI: 16.3–61.6%).\n In healthy control children HCoVs were detected in 3/156 (1.9%, 95% CI: 0.4–5.5%) NP swabs and 1/150 (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.02–3.3%) stool samples.\n It seems that an etiological role of HCoVs is most likely in children with FS, considering that they had a higher proportion of positive HCoVs results than patients with AB and those with AGE, and had the highest viral load; however, the co-detection of other viruses was 52.6%.\n","id":"PMC4865086","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Monika","surname":"Jevšnik","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrej","surname":"Steyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marko","surname":"Pokorn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tatjana","surname":"Mrvi?","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Štefan","surname":"Grosek","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Franc","surname":"Strle","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lara","surname":"Lusa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Miroslav","surname":"Petrovec","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Oliver","surname":"Schildgen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Oliver","surname":"Schildgen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/jmv.1890060309","date":"1980-09-11","title":"Coronavirus

viral genes, like the S gene in HCoV-OC43, which may contribute to a more efficient establishment of a less pathogenic but persistent CNS infection.\n This adaptative mechanism could potentially be

likely involves a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental triggering factors.\n Given that exposure to numerous infectious pathogens occurs during childhood, and that some viral infections can lead to neurodegeneration and demyelination, it is conceivable that some viruses may act as triggering factors in neuropathogenesis.\n We have previously shown that the prototype OC43

properties in susceptible BALB/c mice, where it leads to a chronic encephalitis with accompanying disabilities.\n Here, we show that mutations in the viral spike glycoprotein, reproducibly acquired during viral persistence in human neural cell cultures, led to a drastically modified virus-induced neuropathology in BALB/c mice, characterized by flaccid paralysis and demyelination.\n Even though infection by both mutated and wild-type viruses led to neuroinflammation, the modified neuropathogenesis induced by the mutated virus was associated with increased viral spread and significantly more CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system, as well as significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 and the chemokine CCL2 (monocyte

East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in South Korea was reported on 20th May 2015, there have been 186 confirmed cases, 38 deaths and 16,752 suspected cases.\n\n Previously published research on South Korea's MERS outbreak was limited to the early stages, when few data were available.\n\n Now that the outbreak has ended, albeit unofficially, a more comprehensive review is appropriate.\n\n\nMethods\nData were obtained through the MERS portal by the Ministry for Health and Welfare (MOHW) and Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, press releases by MOHW, and reports by the MERS Policy Committee of the Korean Medical Association.\n\n Cases were analysed for general characteristics, exposure source, timeline and infection generation.\n\n Sex, age and underlying diseases were analysed for the 38 deaths.\n\n\nFindings\nBeginning with the index case that infected 28 others, an in-depth analysis was conducted.\n\n The average age was 55 years, which was a little higher than the global average of 50 years.\n\n As in most other countries, more men than women were affected.\n\n The case fatality rate was 19.9%, which was lower than the global rate of 38.7% and the rate in Saudi Arabia (36.5%).\n\n In total, 184 patients were infected nosocomially and there were no community-acquired infections.\n\n The main underlying diseases were respiratory diseases, cancer and hypertension.\n\n The main contributors to the outbreak were late diagnosis, quarantine failure of ‘super spreaders’, familial care-giving and visiting, non-disclosure by patients, poor communication by the South Korean Government, inadequate hospital infection management, and ‘doctor shopping’.\n\n The outbreak was entirely nosocomial, and was largely attributable to infection management and policy failures, rather than biomedical factors.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7114867","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"K.H.","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"T.E.","surname":"Tandi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.W.","surname":"Choi","email":"shine@korea.ac.kr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.M.","surname":"Moon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"M.S.","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1159/000453066","date":"2016-11-03","title":"Coronavirus

herpesviruses.\n Other viruses that have been studied in this context include, measles, mumps, and rubella.\n Epidemiological studies in humans and experimental studies in animal have shown that viral infections can induce or protect from autoimmunopathologies depending on several factors including genetic background, host-elicited immune responses, type of virus strain, viral load, and the onset time of infection.\n Still, data delineating the clear mechanistic interaction between the virus and the immune system to induce autoreactivity are scarce.\n Available data indicate that viral-induced autoimmunity can be activated through multiple mechanisms including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, bystander activation, and immortalization of infected B cells.\n Contrarily, the protective effects can be achieved via regulatory immune responses which lead to the suppression of autoimmune phenomena.\n Therefore, a better understanding of the immune-related molecular processes in virus-induced autoimmunity is warranted.\n Here we provide an overview of the current understanding of viral-induced autoimmunity and the mechanisms that are associated with this phenomenon.\n","id":"PMC6723519","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria K.","surname":"Smatti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Farhan

Gene 7 is only present in members of coronavirus genus a1, and encodes a hydrophobic protein of 78 aa.\n To study gene 7 function, a recombinant TGEV virus lacking gene 7 was engineered (rTGEV-?7).\n Both the mutant and the parental (rTGEV-wt) viruses showed the same growth and viral RNA accumulation kinetics in tissue cultures.\n Nevertheless, cells infected with rTGEV-?7 virus showed an increased cytopathic effect caused by an enhanced apoptosis mediated by caspase activation.\n Macromolecular synthesis analysis showed that rTGEV-?7 virus infection led to host translational shut-off and increased cellular RNA degradation compared with rTGEV-wt infection.\n An increase of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2?) phosphorylation and an enhanced nuclease, most likely RNase L, activity were observed in rTGEV-?7 virus infected cells.\n These results suggested that the removal of gene 7 promoted an intensified dsRNA-activated host antiviral response.\n In protein 7 a conserved sequence motif that potentially mediates binding to protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1c), a key regulator of the cell antiviral defenses, was identified.\n We postulated that TGEV protein 7 may counteract host antiviral response by its association with PP1c.\n In fact, pull-down assays demonstrated the interaction between TGEV protein 7, but not a protein 7 mutant lacking PP1c binding motif, with PP1. Moreover, the interaction between protein 7 and PP1 was required, during the infection, for eIF2? dephosphorylation and inhibition of cell RNA degradation.\n Inoculation of newborn piglets with rTGEV-?7 and rTGEV-wt viruses showed that rTGEV-?7 virus presented accelerated growth kinetics and pathology compared with the parental virus.\n Overall, the results indicated that gene 7 counteracted host cell defenses, and modified TGEV persistence increasing TGEV survival.\n Therefore, the acquisition of gene 7 by the TGEV genome most likely has provided a selective advantage to the virus.\n","id":"PMC3111541","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jazmina L.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in

data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January 10 to February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed.\n\n The data of laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection.\n\n The median age was 58 years and 235 were male.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia.\n\n Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.\n\n Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines.\n\n The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases.\n\n Both helper T cells and suppressor

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

formidable obstacles, viruses have evolved mechanisms of evasion, masking nucleic acid structures recognized by the host, sequestering themselves away from the cytosol or targeting host sensors, and

resistance to Theiler’s virus-induced demyelinating disease","abstract":"Background\nExperimental infection of mice with Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is used as an animal model of human multiple sclerosis.\n\n TMEV persists in susceptible mouse strains and causes a biphasic disease consisting of acute polioencephalomyelitis and chronic demyelinating leukomyelitis.\n\n In contrast, resistant mice eliminate the virus within 2 to 4 weeks, which seems to be based on a strong antiviral innate immune response including the activation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway.\n\n Several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as IFN-stimulated protein of 15 kDa (ISG15), protein kinase R (PKR), and 2?5?-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) function as antiviral effectors and might contribute to virus elimination.\n\n Nevertheless, detailed investigations of the type I IFN pathway during TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) are lacking.\n\n\nMethods\nThe present study evaluated microarray data of the spinal cord obtained from susceptible SJL/J mice after TMEV infection focusing on IFN-related genes.\n\n Moreover, ISG gene and protein expression was determined in mock- and TMEV-infected SJL/J mice and compared to its expression in resistant C57BL/6 mice using real- time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence.\n\n\nResults\nInterestingly, despite of increased ISG gene expression during TMEV-IDD, ISG protein expression was impaired in SJL/J mice and mainly restricted to demyelinated lesions.\n\n In contrast, high ISG protein levels were found in spinal cord gray and white matter of C57BL/6 compared to SJL/J mice in the acute and chronic phase of TMEV-IDD.\n\n In both mouse strains, ISG15 was mainly found in astrocytes and endothelial cells, whereas PKR was predominantly expressed by microglia/macrophages, oligodendrocytes, and neurons.\n\n Only few cells were immunopositive for OAS proteins.\n\n\nConclusions\nHigh levels of antiviral ISG15 and PKR proteins in the spinal cord of C57BL/6 mice might block virus replication and play an important role in the resistance to TMEV-IDD.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12974-015-0462-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

infection by viperin","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Flaviviruses are a group of diverse and emerging arboviruses and an immense global health problem.\n\n A number of flaviviruses are neurotropic, causing severe encephalitis and even death.\n\n Type I interferons (IFNs) are the first line of defense of the innate immune system against flavivirus infection.\n\n IFNs elicit the concerted action of numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to restrict both virus infection and replication.\n\n Viperin (virus-inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated, IFN-inducible) is an ISG with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple flaviviruses in vitro.\n\n Its activity in vivo restricts neurotropic infections to specific regions of the central nervous system (CNS).\n\n However, the cell types in which viperin activity is required are unknown.\n\n Here we have examined both the regional and cell-type specificity of viperin in the defense against infection by several model neurotropic flaviviruses.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Viral burden and IFN induction were analyzed in vivo in wild-type and viperin?/? mice infected with Langat virus (LGTV).\n\n The effects of IFN pretreatment were tested in vitro in primary neural cultures from different brain regions in response to infection with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV).\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Viperin activity restricted nonlethal LGTV infection in the spleen and the olfactory bulb following infection via a peripheral route.\n\n Viperin activity was also necessary to restrict LGTV replication in the olfactory bulb and the cerebrum following CNS infection, but not in the cerebellum.\n\n In vitro, viperin could restrict TBEV replication in primary cortical neurons, but not in the cerebellar granule cell neurons.\n\n Interferon-induced viperin was also very important in primary cortical neurons to control TBEV, WNV, and ZIKV.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Our findings show that viperin restricts replication of neurotropic flaviviruses in the CNS in a region- and cell-type-specific manner.\n\n The most important sites of activity are the olfactory bulb and cerebrum.\n\n Activity within the cerebrum is required in the cortical neurons in order to restrict spread.\n\n This study exemplifies cell type and regional diversity of the IFN response within the CNS and shows the importance of a potent broad-spectrum antiviral ISG.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

known which of the numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) mediate the antiviral effect.\n A prominent family of ISGs is the interferon-induced with tetratricopeptide repeats (Ifit) genes comprising three members in mice, Ifit1/ISG56, Ifit2/ISG54 and Ifit3/ISG49.\n Intranasal infection with a low dose of VSV is not lethal to wild-type mice and all three Ifit genes are induced in the central nervous system of the infected mice.\n We tested their potential contributions to the observed protection of wild-type mice from VSV pathogenesis, by taking advantage of the newly generated knockout mice lacking either Ifit2 or Ifit1.\n We observed that in Ifit2 knockout (Ifit2\n?/?) mice, intranasal VSV infection was uniformly lethal and death was preceded by neurological signs, such as ataxia and hind limb paralysis.\n In contrast, wild-type and Ifit1\n?/? mice were highly protected and survived without developing such disease.\n However, when VSV was injected intracranially, virus replication and survival were not significantly different between wild-type and Ifit2?/? mice.\n When administered intranasally, VSV entered the central nervous system through the olfactory bulbs, where it replicated equivalently in wild-type and Ifit2\n?/? mice and induced interferon-?.\n However, as the infection spread to other regions of the brain, VSV titers rose several hundred folds

agent of Japanese encephalitis which is more prevalent in South and Southeast Asia.\n\n JEV is a neurotropic virus which infiltrates into the brain through vascular endothelial cells.\n\n JEV infects neurons and microglial cells which causes neuronal damage and inflammation.\n\n However, JEV also evades the cellular immune response to survive in host cells.\n\n Viruses are known to modulate the expression of microRNAs, which in turn modulate cellular immune response by targeting expression of antiviral genes.\n\n The aim of this study is to understand the anti-inflammatory role of miR-146a during JEV infection, which facilitates immune evasion.\n\n\nMethods\nHuman brain microglial cells (CHME3) were infected by JEV: JaOArS982 and P20778 strain, and expression of miR-146a were analyzed.\n\n Overexpression and knockdown studies of miR-146a were done to see the effect on NF-?B pathway and antiviral Jak-STAT pathway.\n\n Regulatory role of miR-146a on expression of interferon-stimulated genes was determined by real-time PCR and luciferase assays.\n\n\nResults\nJEV infection elevated the expression of miR-146a in JaOArS982 strain which caused downregulation of TRAF6, IRAK1, IRAK2, and STAT1 genes.\n\n Exogenous overexpression of miR-146a led to suppression of NF-?B activation and abrogation of Jak-STAT pathway upon JEV infection which led to downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (IFIT-1 and IFIT-2) and facilitated viral replication.\n\n JEV infection initially upregulated cytokine production and activated STAT1 activity but STAT1 levels reduced at later time point, which led to the downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes.\n\n\nConclusion\nUpregulation of miR-146a by JEV JaOArS982 strain leads to suppression of NF-?B activity and disruption of antiviral Jak-STAT signaling which helps the virus to evade the cellular immune response.\n\n This effect of JEV infection on miR-146a expression was found to be strain

a still unknown biological function.\n\n The considered literature indicates this protein as a key-pleiotropic factor reflecting JAK-STAT and DAMPs pathways activation in innate immunity-dependent inflammation, as well as in the physiology and general pathology of a wide range of phylogenetically distant organisms.\n\n These findings also indicate IFP35 as a biologically relevant molecule in human demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system, including Multiple Sclerosis, and other organ-specific chronic inflammatory disorders.\n\n\nAbstract\nDiscovered in 1993 by Bange et al.\n\n, the 35-kDa interferon-induced protein (IFP35) is a highly conserved cytosolic interferon-induced leucine zipper protein with a 17q12-21 coding gene and unknown function.\n\n Belonging to interferon stimulated genes (ISG), the IFP35 reflects the type I interferon (IFN) activity induced through the JAK-STAT phosphorylation, and it can homodimerize with N-myc-interactor (NMI) and basic leucine zipper transcription factor (BATF), resulting in nuclear translocation and a functional expression.\n\n Casein kinase 2-interacting protein-1 (CKIP-1), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 Epinephelus coioides (EcLGP2) are thought to regulate IFP35, via the innate immunity pathway.\n\n Several in vitro and in vivo studies on fish and mammals have confirmed the IFP35 as an ISG factor with antiviral and antiproliferative functions.\n\n However, in a mice model of sepsis, IFP35 was found working as a damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule, which enhances inflammation by acting in the innate immune-mediated way.\n\n In human pathology, the IFP35 expression level predicts disease outcome and response to therapy in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), reflecting IFN activity.\n\n Specifically, IFP35 was upregulated in Lupus Nephritis (LN), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and untreated MS.\n\n However, it normalized in the MS patients undergoing therapy.\n\n The considered data indicate IFP35 as a pleiotropic factor, suggesting it as biologically relevant in the innate immunity, general pathology, and human demyelinating

the CNS via a hematogenous or non-hematogenous route, it may cause structural and functional disorders of the BBB, and also activate the BBB anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory innate immune response.\n This article focuses on the structural and functional changes that occur in the three main components of the BBB (endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes) in response to infection with neurotropic viruses transmitted by hematogenous routes, and also briefly describes the supportive effect of three cells on the BBB under normal physiological conditions.\n For example, all three types of cells express several PRRs, which can quickly sense the virus and make corresponding immune responses.\n The pro-inflammatory immune response will exacerbate the destruction of the BBB, while the anti-inflammatory immune response, based on type I IFN, consolidates the stability of the BBB.\n Exploring the details of the interaction between the host and the pathogen at the BBB during neurotropic virus infection will help to propose new treatments for viral encephalitis.\n Enhancing the defense function of the BBB, maintaining the integrity of the BBB, and suppressing the pro-inflammatory immune response of the BBB provide more ideas for limiting the neuroinvasion of neurotropic viruses.\n In the future, these new treatments are expected to cooperate with traditional antiviral methods to improve the therapeutic effect of viral encephalitis.\n","id":"PMC7882805","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhuangzhuang","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guozhong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guozhong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3389/fmicb.2019.00525","date":"2019-02-28","title":"Pathways Exploited by Flaviviruses to Counteract the Blood-Brain Barrier and Invade the Central Nervous System","abstract":"Human infection by different flaviviruses may cause severe neurologic syndromes, through pathogenic mechanisms that are still largely unknown.\n Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are believed to reach the central nervous system by a hematogenous route, upon crossing the blood-brain barrier.\n Although the disruption of BBB during flavivirus infection has been largely evidenced in experimental models, the relevance of BBB breakdown for virus entering the brain was not completely elucidated.\n In vitro models of BBB had demonstrated that these viruses replicated in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), which induced downregulation of tight junction proteins and increased the permeability of the barrier.\n Other reports demonstrated that infection of BMECs allowed the basolateral release of infectious particles, without a remarkable cytopathic effect, what might be sufficient for virus invasion.\n Virus replication and activation of other cells associated to the BBB, mostly astrocytes and microglia, were also reported to affect the endothelial barrier permeability.\n This event might occur simultaneously or after BMECs infection, being a secondary effect leading to BBB disruption.\n Importantly, activation of BMECs, astrocytes, and microglia by flaviviruses was associated to the expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators, which are believed to recruit leukocytes to the CNS.\n The leukocyte infiltrate could further mediate viral invasion through a Trojan horse mechanism and might contribute to BBB breakdown and to neurological alterations.\n This review discussed the previous studies regarding in vitro and in vivo models of JEV, WNV, ZIKV, YFV, DENV, and TBEV infection and addressed the pathways for BBB overcome and invasion of the CNS described for each virus infection, aiming to increment the knowledge and stimulate further discussion about the role of BBB in the neuropathogenesis of flavivirus infection.\n","id":"PMC6447710","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yasmin

that still causes more than 59,000 human deaths each year.\n Type III interferon IFN-?s are cytokines with type I IFN-like antiviral activities.\n Although IFN-? can restrict the infection for some viruses, especially intestinal viruses, the inhibitory effect against RABV infection remains undefined.\n In this study, the function of type III IFN against RABV infection was investigated.\n Initially, we found that IFN-?2 and IFN-?3 could inhibit RABV replication in cells.\n To characterize the role of IFN-? in RABV infection in a mouse model, recombinant RABVs expressing murine IFN-?2 or IFN-?3, termed as rB2c-IFN?2 or rB2c-IFN?3, respectively, were constructed and rescued.\n It was found that expression of IFN-? could reduce the pathogenicity of RABV and limit viral spread in the brains by different infection routes.\n Furthermore, expression of IFN-? could induce the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, resulting in the production of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).\n It was also found that rRABVs expressing IFN-? could reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines in primary astrocytes and microgila cells, restrict the opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and prevent excessive infiltration of inflammatory cells into the brain, which could be responsible for the neuronal damage caused by RABV.\n Consistently, IFN-? was found to maintain the integrity of tight junction (TJ) protein ZO-1 of BBB to alleviate neuroinflammation in a transwell model.\n Our study underscores the role of IFN-? in inhibiting RABV infection, which potentiates IFN-? as a

evident that cross talk between the immune system and the CNS does occur.\n\n As a result, patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease or psoriasis, are often further burdened with neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression, anxiety and fatigue.\n\n Despite the recent advances in our understanding of neuroimmune communication pathways, the precise effect of peripheral immune activation on neural circuitry remains unclear.\n\n Utilizing transcriptomics in a well-characterized murine model of systemic inflammation, we have started to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which inflammation originating in the periphery can induce transcriptional modulation in the brain.\n\n\nMethods\nSeveral different systemic and tissue-specific models of peripheral toll-like-receptor-(TLR)-driven (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid and Imiquimod) and sterile (tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)) inflammation were induced in C57BL/6 mice.\n\n Whole brain transcriptional profiles were assessed and compared 48 hours after intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide or vehicle, using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays.\n\n Target gene induction, identified by microarray analysis, was validated independently using qPCR.\n\n Expression of the same panel of target genes was then investigated in a number of sterile and other TLR-dependent models of peripheral inflammation.\n\n\nResults\nMicroarray analysis of whole brains collected 48 hr after LPS challenge revealed increased transcription of a range of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the brain.\n\n In addition to acute LPS challenge, ISGs were induced in the brain following both chronic LPS-induced systemic inflammation and Imiquimod-induced skin inflammation.\n\n Unique to the brain, this transcriptional response is indicative of peripherally triggered, interferon-mediated CNS inflammation.\n\n Similar models of sterile inflammation and lipoteichoic-acid-induced systemic inflammation did not share the capacity to trigger ISG induction in the brain.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese data highlight ISG induction in the brain as being a consequence of a TLR-induced type I interferon response.\n\n As considerable evidence links type I interferons to psychiatric disorders, we hypothesize that interferon production in the brain could represent an important mechanism, linking peripheral TLR-induced inflammation with behavioural

respond quickly to various CNS injuries including trauma, ischemia, and infection and maintain the homeostasis of CNS, but this response is not always good; sometimes, it will exacerbate damage.\n Studies have shown that microglia also act as a double-edged sword during viral encephalitis.\n On the one hand, microglia can sense ATP signals through the purinergic receptor P2Y12 and are recruited

themselves or indirect antiviral effects by IFN-1 acting on other cells to activate corresponding signaling pathways.\n In addition, microglia can also exert an antiviral effect by inducing autophagy

Neuroprotection by NRG-1 was associated with the suppression of pro-inflammatory gene expression in brain tissues.\n\n Over-activation of brain microglia can induce pro-inflammatory gene expression by activation of transcriptional regulators following stroke.\n\n Here, we examined how NRG-1 transcriptionally regulates inflammatory gene expression by computational bioinformatics and in vitro using microglial cells.\n\n\nMethods\nTo identify transcriptional regulators involved in ischemia-induced inflammatory gene expression, rats were sacrificed 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and NRG-1 treatment.\n\n Gene expression profiles of brain tissues following ischemia and NRG-1 treatment were examined by microarray technology.\n\n The Conserved Transcription Factor-Binding Site Finder (CONFAC) bioinformatics software package was used to predict transcription factors associated with inflammatory genes induced following stroke and suppressed by NRG-1 treatment.\n\n NF-kappa B (NF-kB) was identified as a potential transcriptional regulator of NRG-1-suppressed genes following ischemia.\n\n The involvement of specific NF-kB subunits in NRG-1-mediated inflammatory responses was examined using N9 microglial cells pre-treated with NRG-1 (100 ng/ml) followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 ?g/ml) stimulation.\n\n The effects of NRG-1 on cytokine production were investigated using Luminex technology.\n\n The levels of the p65, p52, and RelB subunits of NF-kB and IkB-? were determined by western blot analysis and ELISA.\n\n Phosphorylation of IkB-? was investigated by ELISA.\n\n\nResults\nCONFAC identified 12 statistically over-represented transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS) in our dataset, including NF-kBP65. Using N9 microglial cells, we observed that NRG-1 significantly inhibited LPS-induced TNF? and IL-6 release.\n\n LPS increased the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB-? which was blocked by NRG-1. NRG-1 also prevented the nuclear translocation of the NF-kB p65 subunit following LPS administration.\n\n However, NRG-1 increased production of the neuroprotective cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and the nuclear translocation of the NF-kB p52 subunit, which is associated with the induction of anti-apoptotic and suppression of pro-inflammatory gene expression.\n\n\nConclusions\nNeuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of NRG-1 are associated with the differential regulation of NF-kB signaling pathways in microglia.\n\n Taken together, these findings suggest that NRG-1 may be a potential therapeutic treatment for treating stroke and other neuroinflammatory disorders.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5011915","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lauren J.","surname":"Simmons","email":"lsimmons@msm.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Monique C.","surname":"Surles-Zeigler","email":"monique.surles-zeigler@yale.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yonggang","surname":"Li","email":"Yonggang.Li@medsch.ucr.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gregory D.","surname":"Ford","email":"gford@highlands.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gale D.","surname":"Newman","email":"gnewman@msm.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Byron D.","surname":"Ford","email":"byron.ford@medsch.ucr.edu","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1006004","date":"2016-10-16","title":"Zika (PRVABC59) Infection Is Associated with T cell Infiltration and Neurodegeneration in CNS of Immunocompetent Neonatal C57Bl/6 Mice","abstract":"The recent spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with increased rates of Guillain Barre and other neurological disorders as well as congenital defects that include microcephaly has created an urgent need to develop animal models to examine the pathogenesis of the disease and explore the efficacy of potential therapeutics and vaccines.\n Recently developed infection models for ZIKV utilize mice defective in interferon responses.\n In this study we establish and characterize a new model of peripheral ZIKV infection using immunocompetent neonatal C57BL/6 mice and compare its clinical progression, virus distribution, immune response, and neuropathology with that of C57BL/6-IFNAR KO mice.\n We show that while ZIKV infected IFNAR KO mice develop bilateral hind limb paralysis and die 5–6 days post-infection (dpi), immunocompetent B6 WT mice develop signs of neurological disease including unsteady gait, kinetic tremors, severe ataxia and seizures by 13 dpi that subside gradually over 2 weeks.\n Immunohistochemistry show viral antigen predominantly in cerebellum at the peak of the disease in both models.\n However, whereas IFNAR KO mice showed infiltration by neutrophils and macrophages and higher expression of IL-1, IL-6 and Cox2, B6 WT mice show a cellular infiltration in the CNS composed predominantly of T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, and increased mRNA expression levels of IFNg, GzmB and Prf1 at peak of disease.\n Lastly, the CNS of B6 WT mice shows evidence of neurodegeneration predominantly in the cerebellum that are less prominent in mice lacking the IFN response possibly due to the difference in cellular infiltrates and rapid progression of the disease in that model.\n The development of the B6 WT model of ZIKV infection will provide insight into the immunopathology of the virus and facilitate assessments of possible therapeutics and vaccines.\n","id":"PMC5113993","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mohanraj","surname":"Manangeeswaran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Derek D.

Control of Zika Infection Is Independent of Interferon Type I and Type III Expression","abstract":"Simple Summary\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus first isolated from the Zika forest, Uganda, in 1947, which has been spreading across continents since then.\n\n We now know ZIKV causes both microencephaly in newborns and neurological complications in adults; however, no effective treatment options have yet been found.\n\n A more complete understanding of Zika-infection-mediated pathogenesis and host responses is required to enable the development of novel treatment strategies.\n\n In this study, efforts were made to elucidate the host responses following Zika virus infection using several astrocyte cell models, as astrocytes are a major cell type within the central nervous system (CNS) with significant antiviral ability.\n\n Our data suggest that astrocytes can resist ZIKV both in an interferon type I- and III-independent manner and suggest that an early and more diverse antiviral response may be more effective in controlling Zika infection.\n\n This study also identifies astrocyte cellular models that appear to display differential abilities in the control of viral infection, which may assist in the study of alternate neurotropic virus infections.\n\n Overall, this work adds to the growing body of knowledge surrounding ZIKV-mediated cellular host interactions and will contribute to a better understanding of ZIKV-mediated pathogenesis.\n\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a pathogenic neurotropic virus that infects the central nervous system (CNS) and results in various neurological complications.\n\n Astrocytes are the dominant CNS cell producer of the antiviral cytokine IFN-?, however little is known about the factors involved in their ability to mediate viral infection control.\n\n Recent studies have displayed differential responses in astrocytes to ZIKV infection, and this study sought to elucidate astrocyte cell-specific responses to ZIKV using a variety of cell models infected with either the African (MR766) or Asian (PRVABC59) ZIKV strains.\n\n Expression levels of pro-inflammatory (TNF-? and IL-1?) and inflammatory (IL-8) cytokines following viral infection were low and mostly comparable within the ZIKV-resistant and ZIKV-susceptible astrocyte models, with better control of proinflammatory cytokines displayed in resistant astrocyte cells, synchronising with the viral infection level at specific timepoints.\n\n Astrocyte cell lines displaying ZIKV-resistance also demonstrated early upregulation of multiple antiviral genes compared with susceptible astrocytes.\n\n Interestingly, pre-stimulation of ZIKV-susceptible astrocytes with either poly(I:C) or poly(dA:dT) showed efficient protection against ZIKV compared with pre-stimulation with either recombinant IFN-? or IFN-?, perhaps indicating that a more diverse antiviral gene expression is necessary for astrocyte control of ZIKV, and this is driven in part through interferon-independent

type I interferon response protects astrocytes from flavivirus infection and virus-induced cytopathic effects","abstract":"Background\nNeurotropic flaviviruses such as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) are causative agents of severe brain-related diseases including meningitis, encephalitis, and microcephaly.\n\n We have previously shown that local type I interferon response within the central nervous system (CNS) is involved in the protection of mice against tick-borne flavivirus infection.\n\n However, the cells responsible for mounting this protective response are not defined.\n\n\nMethods\nPrimary astrocytes were isolated from wild-type (WT) and interferon alpha receptor knock out (IFNAR?/?) mice and infected with neurotropic flaviviruses.\n\n Viral replication and spread, IFN induction and response, and cellular viability were analyzed.\n\n Transcriptional levels in primary astrocytes treated with interferon or supernatant from virus-infected cells were analyzed by RNA sequencing and evaluated by different bioinformatics tools.\n\n\nResults\nHere, we show that astrocytes control viral replication of different TBEV strains, JEV, WNV, and ZIKV.\n\n In contrast to fibroblast, astrocytes mount a rapid interferon response and restrict viral spread.\n\n Furthermore, basal expression levels of key interferon-stimulated genes are high in astrocytes compared to mouse embryonic fibroblasts.\n\n Bioinformatic analysis of RNA-sequencing data reveals that astrocytes have established a basal antiviral state which contributes to the rapid viral recognition and upregulation of interferons.\n\n The most highly upregulated pathways in neighboring cells were linked to type I interferon response and innate immunity.\n\n The restriction in viral growth was dependent on interferon signaling, since loss of the interferon receptor, or its blockade in wild-type cells, resulted in high viral replication and virus-induced cytopathic effects.\n\n Astrocyte supernatant from TBEV-infected cells can restrict TBEV growth in astrocytes already 6 h post infection, the effect on neurons is highly reinforced, and astrocyte supernatant from 3 h post infection is already protective.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings suggest that the combination of an intrinsic constitutive antiviral response and the fast induction of type I IFN production by astrocytes play an important role in self-protection of astrocytes and suppression of flavivirus replication in the CNS.\n\n\nElectronic

cellular innate immunity and suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication","abstract":"The lack of antiviral innate immune responses during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is characterized by limited production of interferons (IFNs).\n One protein associated with Aicardi–Goutières syndrome, SAMHD1, has been shown to negatively regulate the IFN-1 signaling pathway.\n However, it is unclear whether elevated IFN signaling associated with genetic loss of SAMHD1 would affect SARS-CoV-2 replication.\n In this study, we established in vitro tissue culture model systems for SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus OC43 infections in which SAMHD1 protein expression was absent as a result of CRISPR–Cas9 gene KO or lentiviral viral protein X–mediated proteosomal degradation.\n We show that both SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus OC43 replications were suppressed in SAMHD1 KO 293T and differentiated THP-1 macrophage cell lines.\n Similarly, when SAMHD1 was degraded by virus-like particles in primary monocyte-derived macrophages, we observed lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.\n The loss of SAMHD1 in 293T and differentiated THP-1 cells resulted in upregulated gene expression of IFNs and innate immunity signaling proteins from several pathways, with STAT1 mRNA being the most prominently elevated ones.\n Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 replication was significantly increased in both SAMHD1 WT and KO cells when expression and phosphorylation of STAT1 were downregulated by JAK inhibitor baricitinib, which over-rode the activated antiviral innate immunity in the KO cells.\n This further validates baricitinib as a treatment of SARS-CoV-2–infected patients primarily at the postviral clearance stage.\n Overall, our tissue culture model systems demonstrated that the elevated innate immune response and IFN activation upon genetic loss of SAMHD1 effectively suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication.\n","id":"PMC8786443","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Adrian","surname":"Oo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Keivan","surname":"Zandi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Caitlin","surname":"Shepard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Leda

syndrome-associated mutation at ADAR1 gene locus activates innate immune response in mouse brain","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a severe infant or juvenile-onset autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory encephalopathy with an elevated type 1 interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression signature in the brain.\n\n Mutations in seven different protein-coding genes, all linked to DNA/RNA metabolism or sensing, have been identified in AGS patients, but none of them has been demonstrated to activate the IFN pathway in the brain of an animal.\n\n The molecular mechanism of inflammatory encephalopathy in AGS has not been well defined.\n\n Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is one of the AGS-associated genes.\n\n It carries out A-to-I RNA editing that converts adenosine to inosine at double-stranded RNA regions.\n\n Whether an AGS-associated mutation in ADAR1 activates the IFN pathway and causes autoimmune pathogenesis in the brain is yet to be determined.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Mutations in the ADAR1 gene found in AGS patients were introduced into the mouse genome via CRISPR/Cas9 technology.\n\n Molecular activities of the specific p.\n\nK999N mutation were investigated by measuring the RNA editing levels in brain mRNA substrates of ADAR1 through RNA sequencing analysis.\n\n IFN pathway activation in the brain was assessed by measuring ISG expression at the mRNA and protein level through real-time RT-PCR and Luminex assays, respectively.\n\n The locations in the brain and neural cell types that express ISGs were determined by RNA in situ hybridization (ISH).\n\n Potential AGS-related brain morphologic changes were assessed with immunohistological analysis.\n\n Von Kossa and Luxol Fast Blue staining was performed on brain tissue to assess calcification and myelin, respectively.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Mice bearing the ADAR1 p.\n\nK999N were viable though smaller than wild type sibs.\n\n RNA sequencing analysis of neuron-specific RNA substrates revealed altered RNA editing activities of the mutant ADAR1 protein.\n\n Mutant mice exhibited dramatically elevated levels of multiple ISGs within the brain.\n\n RNA ISH of brain sections showed selective activation of ISG expression in neurons and microglia in a patchy pattern.\n\n ISG-15 mRNA was upregulated in ADAR1 mutant brain neurons whereas CXCL10 mRNA was elevated in adjacent astroglia.\n\n No calcification or gliosis was detected in the mutant brain.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>We demonstrated that an AGS-associated mutation in ADAR1, specifically the p.\n\nK999N mutation, activates the IFN pathway in the mouse brain.\n\n The ADAR1 p.\n\nK999N mutant mouse replicates aspects of the brain interferonopathy of AGS.\n\n Neurons and microglia express different ISGs.\n\n Basal ganglia calcification and leukodystrophy seen in AGS patients were not observed in K999N mutant mice, indicating that development of the full clinical phenotype may need an additional stimulus besides AGS mutations.\n\n This mutant mouse presents a robust tool for the investigation of AGS and neuroinflammatory diseases including the modeling of potential “second hits” that enable severe phenotypes of clinically variable diseases.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at

Like interferon-?, co-treatment with a combination of ISG15, USP18, and IL-6 was able to reduce neurogenesis and enhance apoptosis via further downstream activation of STAT1. Further experiments showed that ISG15 and USP18 mediated the interferon-?-induced reduction in neurogenesis (potentially through upregulation of the ISGylation-related proteins UBA7, UBE2L6, and

addition to its role in DNA repair, ATM also regulates proteasome-mediated protein turnover through suppression of the ISG15 pathway.\n This conclusion is based on three major pieces of evidence: First, we demonstrate that proteasome-mediated protein degradation is impaired in A-T cells.\n Second, we show that the reduced protein turnover is causally linked to the elevated expression of the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 in A-T cells.\n Third, we show that expression of the ISG15 is elevated in A-T cells derived from various A-T patients, as well as in brain tissues derived from the ATM knockout mice and A-T patients, suggesting that ATM negatively regulates the ISG15 pathway.\n Our current findings suggest for the first time that proteasome-mediated protein degradation is impaired in A-T cells due to elevated expression of the ISG15 conjugation pathway, which could contribute to progressive neurodegeneration in A-T

Moreover, murine Ifitm5 and 6 did not restrict IAV, but efficiently inhibited filovirus entry.\n We further demonstrate that replication of infectious SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and entry mediated by the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein are restricted by IFITM proteins.\n The profile of IFITM-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV was more similar to that of filoviruses than to IAV.\n Trypsin treatment of receptor-associated SARS-CoV pseudovirions, which bypasses their dependence on lysosomal cathepsin L, also bypassed IFITM-mediated restriction.\n However, IFITM proteins did not reduce cellular cathepsin activity or limit access of virions to acidic intracellular compartments.\n Our data indicate that IFITM-mediated restriction is localized to a late stage in the endocytic pathway.\n They further show that IFITM proteins differentially restrict the entry of a broad range of enveloped viruses, and modulate cellular tropism independently of viral receptor expression.\n","id":"PMC3017121","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"I-Chueh","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charles C.","surname":"Bailey","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica L.","surname":"Weyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sheli R.","surname":"Radoshitzky","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michelle M.","surname":"Becker","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica J.","surname":"Chiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abraham L.","surname":"Brass","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Asim A.","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoli","surname":"Chi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lian","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lindsay E.","surname":"Longobardi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dutch","surname":"Boltz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jens H.","surname":"Kuhn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephen J.","surname":"Elledge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sina","surname":"Bavari","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark R.","surname":"Denison","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hyeryun","surname":"Choe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Farzan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.00655-16","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The interferon-stimulated gene IFITM3 restricts infection and pathogenesis of arthritogenic and encephalitic alphaviruses","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature10921","date":"1970-01-01","title":"IFITM3 restricts the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza","abstract":"","id":"PMC3648786","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Aaron R.","surname":"Everitt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Clare","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Pertel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sinu P.","surname":"John","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rachael S.","surname":"Wash","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sarah E.","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher R.","surname":"Chin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric M.","surname":"Feeley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jennifer S.","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David J.","surname":"Adams","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Helen M.","surname":"Wise","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Leanne","surname":"Kane","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Goulding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Digard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Verneri","surname":"Anttila","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.

Genes, Variants, and Their Roles in the Control and Pathogenesis of Viral Infections","abstract":"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are a family of small proteins that localize in the plasma and endolysosomal membranes.\n IFITMs not only inhibit viral entry into host cells by interrupting the membrane fusion between viral envelope and cellular membranes, but also reduce the production of infectious virions or infectivity of progeny virions.\n Not surprisingly, some viruses can evade the restriction of IFITMs and even hijack the antiviral proteins to facilitate their infectious entry into host cells or promote the assembly of virions, presumably by modulating membrane fusion.\n Similar to many other host defense genes that evolve under the selective pressure of microorganism infection, IFITM genes evolved in an accelerated speed in vertebrates and many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the human population, some of which have been associated with severity and prognosis of viral infection (e.\ng.\n, influenza A virus).\n Here, we review the function and potential impact of genetic variation for IFITM restriction of viral infections.\n Continuing research efforts are required to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying the complicated interaction among IFITMs and viruses in an effort to determine their pathobiological roles in the context of viral infections in

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

COVID-19-Associated ATM and 3 Post-Vaccination ATM Serious Adverse Events With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccine (AZD1222)","abstract":"Introduction\nAlthough acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is a rare neurological condition (1.34-4.6 cases per million/year) COVID-19-associated ATM cases have occurred during the pandemic.\n\n\nCase-finding methods\nWe report a patient from Panama with SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by ATM and present a comprehensive clinical review of 43 patients with COVID-19-associated ATM from 21 countries published from March 2020 to January 2021. In addition, 3 cases of ATM were reported as serious adverse events during the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222).\n\n\nResults\nAll patients had typical features of ATM with acute onset of paralysis, sensory level and sphincter deficits due to spinal cord lesions demonstrated by imaging.\n\n There were 23 males (53%) and 20 females (47%) ranging from ages 21- to 73- years-old (mean age, 49 years), with two peaks at 29 and 58 years, excluding 3 pediatric cases.\n\n The main clinical manifestations were quadriplegia (58%) and paraplegia (42%).\n\n MRI reports were available in 40 patients; localized ATM lesions affected ?3 cord segments (12 cases, 30%) at cervical (5 cases) and thoracic cord levels (7 cases); 28 cases (70%) had longitudinally-extensive ATM (LEATM) involving ?4 spinal cord segments (cervicothoracic in 18 cases and thoracolumbar-sacral in 10 patients).\n\n Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) occurred in 8 patients, mainly women (67%) ranging from 27- to 64-years-old.\n\n Three ATM patients also had blindness from myeloneuritis optica (MNO) and two more also had acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN).\n\n\nConclusions\nWe found ATM to be an unexpectedly frequent neurological complication of COVID-19. Most cases (68%) had a latency of 10 days to 6 weeks that may indicate post-infectious neurological complications mediated by the host’s response to the virus.\n\n In 32% a brief latency (15 hours to 5 days) suggested a direct neurotropic effect of SARS-CoV-2. The occurrence of 3 reported ATM adverse effects among 11,636 participants in the AZD1222 vaccine trials is extremely high considering a worldwide incidence of 0.5/million COVID-19-associated ATM cases found in this report.\n\n The pathogenesis of ATM remains unknown, but it is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 antigens –perhaps also present in the AZD1222 COVID-19 vaccine or its chimpanzee adenovirus adjuvant– may induce immune mechanisms leading to the myelitis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8107358","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gustavo C.","surname":"Román","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fernando","surname":"Gracia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Torres","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexis","surname":"Palacios","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Karla","surname":"Gracia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Diógenes","surname":"Harris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/qjmed/hcab069","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 vaccination-associated myelitis","abstract":"","id":"PMC8083508","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hardeep Singh","surname":"Malhotra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Priyanka","surname":"Gupta","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vikas","surname":"Prabhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ravindra","surname":"Kumar Garg","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Himanshu","surname":"Dandu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vikasendu","surname":"Agarwal","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3389/fimmu.2021.813487","date":"2021-12-15","title":"Case Report: Anti-LGI1 Encephalitis Following COVID-19 Vaccination","abstract":"Anti-leucine rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is characterized by cognitive impairment or rapid progressive dementia, psychiatric disorders, faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS) and refractory hyponatremia.\n Since December 2020, millions of people worldwide have been vaccinated against COVID-19.

reported during the current COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that infection with SARS-CoV-2 affects the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the muscle.\n CNS manifestations include: headache and decreased responsiveness considered initial indicators of potential neurological involvement; anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and dysgeusia are frequent early symptoms of coronavirus infection.\n Respiratory failure, the lethal manifestation of COVID-19, responsible for 264,679 deaths worldwide, is probably neurogenic in origin and may result from the viral invasion of cranial nerve I, progressing into rhinencephalon and brainstem respiratory centers.\n Cerebrovascular disease, in particular large-vessel ischemic strokes, and less frequently cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually occur as part of a thrombotic state induced by viral attachment to ACE2 receptors in endothelium causing widespread endotheliitis, coagulopathy, arterial and venous thromboses.\n Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy is associated to the cytokine storm.\n A frontal hypoperfusion syndrome has been identified.\n There are isolated reports of seizures, encephalopathy, meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis.\n The neurological diseases affecting the PNS and muscle in COVID-19 are less frequent and include Guillain-Barré syndrome; Miller Fisher syndrome; polyneuritis cranialis; and rare instances of viral myopathy with rhabdomyolysis.\n The main conclusion of this review is the pressing need to define the neurology of COVID-19, its frequency, manifestations, neuropathology and pathogenesis.\n On behalf of the World Federation of Neurology we invite national and regional neurological associations to create local databases to report cases with neurological manifestations observed during the on-going pandemic.\n International neuroepidemiological collaboration may help define the

disturbances were accompanied by laboratory evidence of CRS.\n\n Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus?2 (SARS?CoV?2) was undetectable in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\n Hyperalbuminorrachia and increased levels of the astroglial protein S100B were suggestive of blood?brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction.\n\n Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings comprised evidence of acute leukoencephalitis (n = 3, one of whom had a hemorrhagic form), cytotoxic edema mimicking ischaemic stroke (n = 1), or normal results (n = 2).\n\n Treatment with corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulins was attempted, resulting in rapid recovery from neurological disturbances in two cases.\n\n SARS?CoV2 was undetectable in 88 of the 90 patients with COVID?19 who underwent Reverse Transcription?PCR testing of CSF.\n\n\nConclusions\nPatients with COVID?19 can develop neurological manifestations that share clinical, laboratory and imaging similarities with those of chimeric antigen receptor T?cell?related encephalopathy.\n\n The pathophysiological underpinnings appear to involve CRS, endothelial activation, BBB dysfunction, and immune?mediated mechanisms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7461405","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Perrin","email":"peggy.perrin@chru-strasbourg.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"N.","surname":"Collongues","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"N.","surname":"Collongues","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Baloglu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Baloglu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"D.","surname":"Bedo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"X.","surname":"Bassand","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"T.","surname":"Lavaux","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"G.","surname":"Gautier?Vargas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"N.","surname":"Keller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Kremer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Fafi?Kremer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"B.","surname":"Moulin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"I.","surname":"Benotmane","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"I.","surname":"Benotmane","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Caillard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.nbd.2020.105131","date":"2020-10-06","title":"The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alters barrier function in 2D static and 3D microfluidic in-vitro models of the human blood–brain barrier","abstract":"As researchers across the globe have focused their attention on understanding SARS-CoV-2, the picture that is emerging is that of a virus that has serious effects on the vasculature in multiple organ systems including the cerebral vasculature.\n Observed effects on the central nervous system include neurological symptoms (headache, nausea, dizziness), fatal microclot formation and in rare cases encephalitis.\n However, our understanding of how the virus causes these mild to severe neurological symptoms and how the cerebral vasculature is impacted remains unclear.\n Thus, the results presented in this report explored whether deleterious outcomes from the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) could be observed.\n The spike protein, which plays a key role in receptor recognition, is formed by the S1 subunit containing a receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S2 subunit.\n First, using postmortem brain tissue, we show that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 (a known binding target for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), is ubiquitously expressed throughout various vessel calibers in the frontal cortex.\n Moreover, ACE2 expression was upregulated in cases of hypertension and dementia.\n ACE2 was also detectable in primary hBMVECs maintained under cell culture conditions.\n Analysis of cell viability revealed that neither the S1, S2 or a truncated form of the S1 containing only the RBD had minimal effects on hBMVEC viability within a 48 h exposure window.\n Introduction of spike proteins to invitro models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) showed significant changes to barrier properties.\n Key to our findings is the demonstration that S1 promotes loss of barrier integrity in an advanced 3D microfluidic model of the human BBB, a platform that more closely resembles the physiological conditions at this CNS interface.\n Evidence provided suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins trigger a pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells that may contribute to an altered state of BBB function.\n Together, these results are the first to show the direct impact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could have on brain endothelial cells; thereby offering a plausible explanation for the neurological consequences seen in COVID-19 patients.\n","id":"PMC7547916","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tetyana P.","surname":"Buzhdygan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Brandon

Neurotropic Human Respiratory Coronaviruses: Potential Neurovirulent Agents in Humans","abstract":"In humans, viral infections of the respiratory tract are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.\n Several recognized respiratory viral agents have a neuroinvasive capacity since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS).\n Once there, infection of CNS cells (neurotropism) could lead to human health problems, such as encephalitis and long-term neurological diseases.\n Among the various respiratory viruses, coronaviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals.\n Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) usually infect the upper respiratory tract, where they are mainly associated with common colds.\n However, in more vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, they can also affect the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, respiratory distress syndrome, or even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n The respiratory involvement of HCoV has been clearly established since the 1960s.\n In addition, for almost three decades now, the scientific literature has also demonstrated that HCoV are neuroinvasive and neurotropic and could induce an overactivation of the immune system, in part by participating in the activation of autoreactive immune cells that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals.\n Furthermore, it was shown that in the murine CNS, neurons are the main target of infection, which causes these essential cells to undergo degeneration and eventually die by some form of programmed cell death after virus infection.\n Moreover, it appears that the viral surface glycoprotein (S) represents an important factor in the neurodegenerative process.\n Given all these properties, it has been suggested that these recognized human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of neurological diseases for which the etiology remains unknown or poorly understood.\n","id":"PMC7121612","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rameshwar","surname":"Adhikari","email":"nepalpolymer@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Santosh","surname":"Thapa","email":"icidn2012@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Desforges","email":"marc.desforges@iaf.inrs.ca","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Desforges","email":"marc.desforges@iaf.inrs.ca","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alain","surname":"Le

Syndrome","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious viral disease characterized by severe clinical manifestations of the lower respiratory tract.\n The pathogenesis of SARS is highly complex, with multiple factors leading to severe injury in the lungs and dissemination of the virus to several other organs.\n The SARS coronavirus targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage.\n Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury.\n Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease.\n In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms.\n The latter include dysregulation of cytokines/chemokines, deficiencies in the innate immune response, direct infection of immune cells, direct viral cytopathic effects, down-regulation of lung protective angiotensin converting enzyme 2, autoimmunity, and genetic factors.\n It seems that both abnormal immune responses and injury to immune cells may be key factors in the pathogenesis of this new disease.\n","id":"PMC1829448","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jiang","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Korteweg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature12005","date":"2013-02-13","title":"Dipeptidyl

unlikely that this outbreak will be the last.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the long-term psychiatric morbidities in survivors of SARS.\n\n\nMethod\nThis is a cohort study designed to investigate psychiatric complications among SARS survivors treated in the United Christian Hospital 30 months after the SARS outbreak.\n\n Psychiatric morbidities were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Impact of Events Scale–Revised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n\n Functional outcomes were assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey.\n\n\nResults\nNinety subjects were recruited, yielding a response rate of 96.8%.\n\n Post-SARS cumulative incidence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was 58.9%.\n\n Current prevalence for any psychiatric disorder at 30 months post-SARS was 33.3%.\n\n One-fourth of the patients had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 15.6% had depressive disorders.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe outbreak of SARS can be regarded as a mental health catastrophe.\n\n PTSD was the most prevalent long-term psychiatric condition, followed by depressive disorders.\n\n Our results highlight the need to enhance preparedness and competence of health care professionals in detecting and managing the psychological sequelae of future comparable infectious disease outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112501","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ivan Wing

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

All patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020.\nResults\nThe median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients (46%) were men.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]), cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]).\n\n Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients).\n\n As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%.\n\n According to the lowest SpO2 during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2?90% group (n=55) and the SpO2&lt;90% group (n=14).\n\n All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2&lt;90% group.\n\n Compared with SpO2?90% group, patients of the SpO2&lt;90% group were older, and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c reactive protein.\n\n Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate.\n\n\nConclusions\nCOVID-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5%.\n\n Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184452","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhongliang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bohan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qianwen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Wen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruiguang","surname":"Zhang","email":"zrg27@163.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":" Updates on the novel coronavirus outbreak up to March 2, 2020.

health and stigma research, has had little examination.\n This study combines survey and case study methods to examine subjective stigma among residents of Amoy Gardens (AG), the first officially recognized site of community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong.\n A total of 903 residents of AG completed a self-report questionnaire derived from two focus groups conducted toward the end of the 3-month outbreak.\n Case studies of two residents who lived in Block E, the heart of the SARS epidemic at AG, complement the survey data.\n Findings show that stigma affected most residents and took various forms of being shunned, insulted, marginalized, and rejected in the domains of work, interpersonal relationships, use of services and schooling.\n Stigma was also associated with psychosomatic distress.\n Residents’ strategies for diminishing stigma varied with gender, age, education, occupation, and proximity to perceived risk factors for SARS such as residential location, previous SARS infection and the presence of ex-SARS household members.\n Residents attributed stigma to government mismanagement, contagiousness of the mysterious SARS virus, and alarmist media reporting.\n Stigma clearly decreased, but never completely disappeared, after the outbreak.\n The findings confirm and add to existing knowledge on the varied origins, correlates, and impacts of stigma.\n They also highlight the synergistic roles of inconsistent health policy responses and risk miscommunication by the media in rapidly amplifying stigma toward an unfamiliar illness.\n While recognizing the intrinsically stigmatizing nature of public health measures to control SARS, we recommend that a consistent inter-sectoral approach is needed to minimize stigma and to make an effective health response to future

Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

This study reports psychometric properties of a single-item scale to assess sleep quality among individuals with FM.\n\n\nMethods\nAnalyses were based on data from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of pregabalin (studies 1056 and 1077).\n\n In a daily diary, patients reported the quality of their sleep on a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 ('best possible sleep') to 10 ('worst possible sleep').\n\n Test re-test reliability of the Sleep Quality Scale was evaluated by computing intraclass correlation coefficients.\n\n Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between baseline Sleep Quality scores and baseline pain diary and Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep scores.\n\n Responsiveness to treatment was evaluated by standardized effect sizes computed as the difference between least squares mean changes in Sleep Quality scores in the pregabalin and placebo groups divided by the standard deviation of Sleep Quality scores across all patients at baseline.\n\n\nResults\nStudies 1056 and 1077 included 748 and 745 patients, respectively.\n\n Most patients were female (study 1056: 94.4%; study 1077: 94.5%) and white (study 1056: 90.2%; study 1077: 91.0%).\n\n Mean ages were 48.8 years (study 1056) and 50.1 years (study 1077).\n\n Test re-test reliability coefficients of the Sleep Quality Scale were 0.91 and 0.90 in the 1056 and 1077 studies, respectively.\n\n Pearson correlation coefficients between baseline Sleep Quality scores and baseline pain diary scores were 0.64 (p &lt; 0.001) and 0.58 (p &lt; 0.001) in the 1056 and 1077 studies, respectively.\n\n Correlations between the Sleep Quality Scale and the MOS Sleep subscales were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01), except for the MOS Snoring subscale.\n\n Across both studies, standardized effect sizes were generally moderate (0.46 to 0.52) for the 300 mg group and moderate (0.59) or moderate-to-large (0.70) for the 450 mg group.\n\n In study 1056, the effect size for the 600 mg group was moderate-to-large (0.73).\n\n In study 1077, the effect size for the 600 mg group was large (0.82).\n\n\nConclusion\nThese results provide evidence of the reproducibility, convergent validity, and responsiveness to treatment of the Sleep Quality Scale and provide a foundation for its further use and evaluation in FM patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2706811","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph

persistent symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in long-term survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n We wished to evaluate the influence of PTSD on HRQoL and to investigate the influence of perceived social support during intensive care unit (ICU) treatment on both PTSD symptoms and HRQoL.\n\n\nMethods\nIn ARDS patients we prospectively measured HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form; SF-36), symptoms of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome 10-Questions Inventory; PTSS-10), perceived social support (Questionnaire for Social Support; F-Sozu) and symptoms of psychopathology (Symptom Checklist-90-R); and collected sociodemographic data including current employment status.\n\n Sixty-five (50.4%) out of 129 enrolled survivors responded, on average 57 ± 32 months after discharge from ICU.\n\n Measuring symptoms of PTSD the PTSS-10 was used to divide the ARDS patients into two subgroups ('high-scoring patients', indicating patients with an increased risk for developing PTSD, and 'low-scoring patients').\n\n\nResults\nHRQoL was significantly reduced in all dimensions in comparison with age- and gender-adjusted healthy controls.\n\n Eighteen patients (29%) were identified as being at increased risk for PTSD.\n\n PTSD risk was significantly linked with anxiety during their ICU stay.\n\n In this group of patients there was a trend towards permanent or temporary disability, independent of the period between discharge from ICU and study entry.\n\n Perceived social support was associated with a reduction in PTSD symptoms (Pearson correlation; p &lt; 0.05).\n\n Post-hoc test revealed a significant difference between 'high-scoring patients' and 'low-scoring patients' with respect to mental health, although they did not differ in physical dimensions.\n\n\nConclusion\nHRQoL was reduced in long-term survivors, and was linked with an increased risk of chronic PTSD with ensuing psychological morbidity.\n\n This was independent of physical condition and was associated with traumatic memories of anxiety during their ICU stay.\n\n Social support might improve mental health and consequently long-term outcome including employment

among survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\n\nObjectives\nThe objective of this study was to identify the predictors of chronic PTSD in SARS survivors.\n\n\nDesign\nPTSD at 30 months after the SARS outbreak was assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV.\n\n Survivors' demographic data, medical information and psychosocial variables were collected for risk factor analysis.\n\n\nResults\nMultivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender as well as the presence of chronic medical illnesses diagnosed before the onset of SARS and avascular necrosis were independent predictors of PTSD at 30 months post-SARS.\n\n Associated factors included higher-chance external locus of control, higher functional disability and higher average pain intensity.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe study of PTSD at 30 months post-SARS showed that the predictive value of acute medical variables may fade out.\n\n Our findings do not support some prior hypotheses that the use of high dose corticosteroids is protective against the development of PTSD.\n\n On the contrary, the adversity both before and after the SARS outbreak may be more important in hindering recovery from PTSD.\n\n The risk factor analysis can not only improve the detection of hidden psychiatric complications but also provide insight for the possible model of care delivery for the SARS survivors.\n\n With the complex interaction of the biopsychosocial challenges of SARS, an integrated multidisciplinary clinic setting may be a superior approach in the long-term management of complicated PTSD cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7132390","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ivan Wing

Single-prolonged stress (SPS) was simulated on PND 80 to imitate other adulthood stresses of PTSD with gender divisions (M-MS3h-PTSD, F-MS3h-PTSD, M-MS6h-PTSD, F-MS6h-PTSD, M-PTSD, and F-PTSD).\n After the MS and PTSD sessions, behavioral tests were conducted to assess the effectiveness of these treatments, which included an open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), water maze test (WMT), and forced swimming test (FST) to detect anxiety-like behavior (OFT and EPMT), memory behavior (WMT), and depressive behavior (FST).\n The M-MS3h-PTSD group had fewer time entries into the open arms of EPMT than the F-MS3h-PTSD group, and the M-MS6h-PTSD group demonstrated fewer up-right postures in the OFT than the F-MS6h-PTSD group.\n The M-MS3h-PTSD group exhibited more exploratory behavior than the M-MS6h-PTSD and M-PTSD groups in the OFT.\n Less exploratory behavior was observed in the F-MS3h-PTSD group than in the F-MS6h-PTSD group, which demonstrated significantly increased freezing times in the FST compared to the F-PTSD group.\n The WMT revealed significant differences in learning and memory performance between the M-MS3h-PTSD group and other treatment groups, which were not found in the female rats.\n These findings demonstrate that an early stressful experience, such as MS, may be involved in helping the body adapt optimally when faced with additional trauma in adulthood, although mild early life stress might benefit learning and memory among males.\n","id":"PMC6558979","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rucui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haoran","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yani","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guohua","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yanyu","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongwei","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2009.03.001","date":"2009-03-02","title":"Long-term

series.\n\n\nSetting\nTongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nParticipants\nAmong a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed.\n\n Data were collected until 28 February 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)).\n\n The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days.\n\n Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively.\n\n Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\n\n Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35;

Opportunistic Pathogens of the Central Nervous System?","abstract":"Respiratory viruses infect the human upper respiratory tract, mostly causing mild diseases.\n However, in vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract, causing a more severe disease (e.\ng.\n, pneumonia).\n Respiratory viruses can also exacerbate asthma and lead to various types of respiratory distress syndromes.\n Furthermore, as they can adapt fast and cross the species barrier, some of these pathogens, like influenza A and SARS-CoV, have occasionally caused epidemics or pandemics, and were associated with more serious clinical diseases and even mortality.\n For a few decades now, data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that several respiratory viruses have neuroinvasive capacities, since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS).\n Viruses infecting human CNS cells could then cause different types of encephalopathy, including encephalitis, and long-term neurological diseases.\n Like other well-recognized neuroinvasive human viruses, respiratory viruses may damage the CNS as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals (virus-induced neuro-immunopathology) and/or viral replication, which directly causes damage to CNS cells (virus-induced neuropathology).\n The etiological agent of several neurological disorders remains unidentified.\n Opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of these disorders whose etiology remains poorly understood.\n Herein, we present a global portrait of some of the most prevalent or emerging human respiratory viruses that have been associated with possible pathogenic processes in CNS infection, with a special emphasis on human coronaviruses.\n","id":"PMC7020001","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Desforges","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alain","surname":"Le

leukocytes could participate in respiratory pathologies and serve as vector for viral spread towards other tissues, the susceptibility of human leukocytic cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infection was investigated.\n Human primary monocytes/macrophages were susceptible to HCoV-229E infection, but strongly restricted HCoV-OC43 replication.\n Moreover, productive HCoV-229E infection of primary monocytes and of the THP-1 monocytic cell line led to their activation, as indicated by the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-?, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL11 and MMP-9. Moreover, an in vitro chemotaxis assay showed that motility towards chemokines of THP-1 cells and primary monocytes was increased following an acute or persistent HCoV-229E infection.\n Taken together, these results suggest that infected monocytes could serve as a reservoir for HCoV-229E, become activated, participate in the exacerbation of pulmonary pathologies, as well as serve as potential vectors for viral dissemination to host tissues, where it could be associated with other pathologies.\n","id":"PMC7114174","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Desforges","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tina

the eighteenth century, with acute “psychoses of influenza” documented during multiple pandemics.\n In the late 20th century, reports of a season-of-birth effect in schizophrenia were supported by large-scale ecological and sero-epidemiological studies suggesting that maternal influenza infection increases the risk of psychosis in offspring.\n We examine the evidence for the association between influenza infection and schizophrenia risk, before reviewing possible mechanisms via which this risk may be conferred.\n Maternal immune activation models implicate placental dysfunction, disruption of cytokine networks, and subsequent microglial activation as potentially important pathogenic processes.\n More recent neuroimmunological advances focusing on neuronal autoimmunity following infection provide the basis for a model of infection-induced psychosis, potentially implicating autoimmunity to schizophrenia-relevant protein targets including the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.\n Finally, we outline areas for future research and relevant experimental approaches and consider whether the current evidence provides a basis for the rational development of strategies to prevent

neuroinvasive potential of SARS?CoV2 may play a role in the respiratory failure of COVID?19 patients","abstract":"Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS?CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS?CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS?CoV?2 (previously known as 2019?nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world.\n This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS?CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS?CoV and MERS?CoV.\n The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID?19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously.\n Additionally, some patients with COVID?19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases.\n The infection of SARS?CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected.\n Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse?connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways.\n Considering the high similarity between SARS?CoV and SARS?CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS?CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID?19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS?CoV?2?induced respiratory failure.\n","id":"PMC7228394","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan?Chao","surname":"Li","email":"liyanchao@jlu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tsutomu","surname":"Hashikawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.007","date":"2020-03-09","title":"Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control","abstract":"\n\n\n•\nThe vicarious traumatization scores for front-line nurses were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses;","id":"PMC7102670","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhenyu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jingwu","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meiling","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei","surname":"Qiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyue","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiangjiang","surname":"Bi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gaofeng","surname":"Zhan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaolin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Long","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qin","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chenliang","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbing","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shijiang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haiwei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianjun","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yimin","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kenji","surname":"Hashimoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Jia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haofei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cunming","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/emj.2006.035089","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The psychological effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome on emergency department staff","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/CM9.0000000000000744","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus cases in tertiary hospitals in Hubei Province","abstract":"Background\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province of China was isolated in January 2020. This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens.\n\n\nResults\nNone of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20–83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.\n\n Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache.\n\n Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia.\n\n Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography

Human coronaviruses cause respiratory infections that range in seriousness from common colds to severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n Like influenza, coronaviruses can be neurotropic.\n To test for associations between coronaviruses and serious mental disorders, we utilized a recently developed assay and measured immunoglobulin G (IgG) response against 4 human coronavirus strains (229E, HKU1,

differences (HKU1, P ? .\n002; NL63, P ? .\n00001).\n All 4 coronaviruses were more seroprevalent in patients vs controls, with greatest intergroup differences observed for HKU1 (93% vs 77%, P ?

patients.\n All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]).\n In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]).\n It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines.\n Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d?dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C?reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase.\n This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID?19 patients.\n Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia.\n Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID?19.","id":"PMC7228368","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Suxin","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Zheng","email":"yuzheng1@cdutcm.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boqun","surname":"Li","email":"279685211@qq.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boqun","surname":"Li","email":"279685211@qq.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanjun","surname":"Hu","email":"huyanjun@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chunhui","surname":"Lang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daoqiu","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qiuyan","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xia","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinglong","surname":"Lv","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaling","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haoran","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gu","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruishan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.4065/81.10.1361","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychiatric

mortality worldwide.\n Several recognized respiratory viral agents have a neuroinvasive capacity since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS).\n Once there, infection of CNS cells (neurotropism) could lead to human health problems, such as encephalitis and long-term neurological diseases.\n Among the various respiratory viruses, coronaviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals.\n Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) usually infect the upper respiratory tract, where they are mainly associated with common colds.\n However, in more vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, they can also affect the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, respiratory distress syndrome, or even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n The respiratory involvement of HCoV has been clearly established since the 1960s.\n In addition, for almost three decades now, the scientific literature has also demonstrated that HCoV are neuroinvasive and neurotropic and could induce an overactivation of the immune system, in part by participating in the activation of autoreactive immune cells that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals.\n Furthermore, it was shown that in the murine CNS, neurons are the main target of infection, which causes these essential cells to undergo degeneration and eventually die by some form of programmed cell death after virus infection.\n Moreover, it appears that the viral surface glycoprotein (S) represents an important factor in the neurodegenerative process.\n Given all these properties, it has been suggested that these recognized human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of neurological diseases for which the etiology remains unknown or poorly

In this retrospective multicenter study, we investigated the clinical course and outcomes of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from early cases in Republic of Korea.\n\n\nMethods\nAll of the cases confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction were enrolled from the 1st to the 28th patient nationwide.\n\n Clinical data were collected and analyzed for changes in clinical severity including laboratory, radiological, and virologic dynamics during the progression of illness.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age was 40 years (range, 20–73 years) and 15 (53.6%) patients were male.\n\n The most common symptoms were cough (28.6%) and sore throat (28.6%), followed by fever (25.0%).\n\n Diarrhea was not common (10.7%).\n\n Two patients had no symptoms.\n\n Initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed infiltration in 46.4% of the patients, but computed tomography scan confirmed pneumonia in 88.9% (16/18) of the patients.\n\n Six patients (21.4%) required supplemental oxygen therapy, but no one needed mechanical ventilation.\n\n Lymphopenia was more common in severe cases.\n\n Higher level of C-reactive protein and worsening of chest radiographic score was observed during the 5–7 day period after symptom onset.\n\n Viral shedding was high from day 1 of illness, especially from the upper respiratory tract (URT).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe prodromal symptoms of COVID-19 were mild and most patients did not have limitations of daily activity.\n\n Viral shedding from URT was high from the prodromal phase.\n\n Radiological pneumonia was common from the early days of illness, but it was frequently not evident in simple CXR.\n\n These findings could be plausible explanations for the easy and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the

included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%).\n\n Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications.\n\n Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk.\n\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7190011","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Di","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huilong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Danlei","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guang","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haijing","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongwu","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaquan","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meifang","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shusheng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qin","surname":"Ning","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1585","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

evidence suggested an association between the spectrum of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n Most findings were reported in the form of case reports or case series, whereas a comprehensive overview is still lacking.\n We conducted a systematic review and searched for all published cases until July 20th 2020. We included 73 patients reported in 52 publications.\n A broad age range was affected (mean 55, min 11–max 94 years) with male predominance (68.5%).\n Most patients showed respiratory and/or systemic symptoms, and developed GBS manifestations after COVID-19. However, asymptomatic cases for COVID-19 were also described.\n The distributions of clinical variants and electrophysiological subtypes resemble those of classic GBS, with a higher prevalence of the classic sensorimotor form and the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, although rare variants like Miller Fisher syndrome were also reported.\n Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albuminocytological dissociation was present in around 71% cases, and CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in all tested cases.\n More than 70% of patients showed a good prognosis, mostly after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin.\n Patients with less favorable outcome were associated with a significantly older age in accordance with previous findings regarding both classic GBS and COVID-19.

COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic.\n\n Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly.\n\n On the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare.\n\n\nRecent developments\nA growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients.\n\n Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France.\n\n Encephalitis has been described in eight patients to date, and Guillain-Barré syndrome in 19 patients.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients.\n\n Anosmia and ageusia are common, and can occur in the absence of other clinical features.\n\n Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2–6% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. So far, 96 patients with stroke have been described, who frequently had vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin.\n\n\nWhere next?\nCareful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish non-specific complications of severe disease (eg, hypoxic encephalopathy and critical care neuropathy) from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus, including infectious, para-infectious, and post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n\n Recognition of neurological disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic might prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier.\n\n The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will probably remain small.\n\n However, these patients might be left with severe neurological sequelae.\n\n With so many people infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health burden and social and economic costs might be large.\n\n Health-care planners and policy makers must prepare for this eventuality, while the many ongoing studies investigating neurological associations increase our knowledge base.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7332267","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mark A","surname":"Ellul","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Benjamin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bhagteshwar","surname":"Singh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Suzannah","surname":"Lant","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benedict Daniel","surname":"Michael","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ava","surname":"Easton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rachel","surname":"Kneen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sylviane","surname":"Defres","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jim","surname":"Sejvar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Solomon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00415-020-10201-1","date":"2020-08-29","title":"Bickerstaff encephalitis after COVID-19","abstract":"","id":"PMC7471525","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lucía","surname":"Llorente Ayuso","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pedro","surname":"Torres Rubio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rafael Fernando","surname":"Beijinho do Rosário","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Rafael Fernando","surname":"Beijinho do Rosário","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"María Luisa","surname":"Giganto Arroyo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"María Luisa","surname":"Giganto Arroyo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fernando","surname":"Sierra-Hidalgo","email":"fernando.sierragh@salud.madrid.org","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1017/cjn.2020.146","date":"2020-07-02","title":"Neurological Manifestations in COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","abstract":"Background:\nGrowing evidence showed that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection may present with neurological manifestations.\n\n This review aimed to determine the neurological manifestations and complications in COVID-19.\nMethods:\nWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that included cohort and case series/reports involving a population of patients confirmed with COVID-19 infection and their neurologic manifestations.\n\n We searched the following electronic databases until April 18, 2020: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and World Health Organization database (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020180658).\n\n\nResults:\nFrom 403 articles identified, 49 studies involving a total of 6,335 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included.\n\n The random-effects modeling analysis for each neurological symptom showed the following proportional point estimates with 95% confidence intervals: “headache” (0.12;

the subcortical white matter but not the cortical grey matter.\n\n This study describes the disruptive effects of AHNE associated with SARS-CoV-2 on cognitive function in a previously healthy and sound middle-aged woman resulting from alterations in cortical areas involved in the cognitive network.\n\n\nCase Report:\nA 44-year-old previously healthy woman with a history of inter-state travel developed a flu-like illness, followed by acute, steadily progressive cognitive impairment.\n\n She was admitted in a comatose state after a first tonic-clonic seizure.\n\n Blood tests were non-informative.\n\n Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was indicative of AHNE.\n\n Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed mild lymphocytosis with normal protein and normal glucose but an elevated

The decedent was initially hospitalized for surgical management of underlying coronary artery disease.\n He developed post-operative complications and was evaluated with chest imaging studies.\n The chest computed tomography (CT) imaging results were indicative of COVID-19 and he was subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2, which was positive.\n His condition worsened and he died after more than 2 weeks of hospitalization and aggressive treatment.\n The autopsy revealed a range of neuropathological lesions, with features resembling both vascular and demyelinating etiologies.\n Hemorrhagic white matter lesions were present throughout the cerebral hemispheres with surrounding axonal injury and macrophages.\n The subcortical white matter had scattered clusters of macrophages, a range of associated axonal injury, and a perivascular acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like appearance.\n Additional white matter lesions included focal microscopic areas of necrosis with central loss of white matter and marked axonal injury.\n Rare neocortical organizing microscopic infarcts were also identified.\n Imaging and clinical reports have demonstrated central nervous system complications in patients’ with COVID-19, but there is a gap in our understanding of the neuropathology.\n The lesions described in this case provide insight into the potential parainfectious processes affecting COVID-19 patients, which may direct clinical management and ongoing research into the disease.\n The clinical course of the patient also illustrates that during prolonged hospitalizations neurological complications of COVID may develop, which are particularly difficult to evaluate and appreciate in the critically ill.\n","id":"PMC7245994","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"R.

Anosmia, ageusia, other cranial neuropathies and lymphocytopenia are red flags enhancing early diagnostic suspicion.\n\n In Miller-Fisher Syndrome, ganglioside antibodies against GD1b, instead of QG1b, were found; because the COVID-19 spike protein also binds to sialic acid-containing glycoproteins for cell-entry and anti-GD1b antibodies typically cause ataxic neuropathy, cross-reactivity between COVID-19–bearing gangliosides and peripheral nerve glycolipids was addressed.\n\n Elevated Creatine Kinase (&gt;10,000) is reported in 10% of COVID-19–infected patients; two such patients presented with painful muscle weakness responding to IVIg indicating that COVID-19–triggered NAM is an overlooked entity.\n\n Cases of acute necrotizing brainstem encephalitis, cranial neuropathies with leptomeningeal enhancement, and tumefactive postgadolinium-enhanced demyelinating lesions are now emerging with the need to explore neuroinvasion and autoimmunity.\n\n Concerns for modifications-if any-of chronic immunotherapies with steroids, mycophenolate, azathioprine, IVIg, and anti-B-cell agents were addressed; the role of complement in innate immunity to viral responses and anti-complement therapeutics (i.\n\ne.\n\n eculizumab) were reviewed.\n\n\nConclusions\nEmerging data indicate that COVID-19 can trigger not only GBS but other autoimmune neurological diseases necessitating vigilance for early diagnosis and therapy initiation.\n\n Although COVID-19 infection, like most other viruses, can potentially worsen patients with pre-existing autoimmunity, there is no evidence that patients with autoimmune neurological diseases stable on common immunotherapies are facing increased risks of infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7309518","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marinos C.","surname":"Dalakas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00134-020-06079-2","date":"2020-04-28","title":"Systemic arterial thrombosis and acute mesenteric ischemia in a patient with COVID-19","abstract":"","id":"PMC7232609","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Eya","surname":"Azouz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sisi","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laurence","surname":"Monnier-Cholley","email":"laurence.monnier-cholley@aphp.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lionel","surname":"Arrivé","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lionel","surname":"Arrivé","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jad.2013.06.004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"CRP, IL-6 and depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0017030","date":"2011-01-10","title":"The Impact of Pandemic Influenza H1N1 on Health-Related Quality of Life: A Prospective Population-Based Study","abstract":"Background\nWhile the H1N1v influenza pandemic in 2009 was clinically mild, with a low case-fatality rate, the overall disease burden measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) lost has not been estimated.\n\n Such a measure would allow comparison with other diseases and assessment of the cost-effectiveness of pandemic control measures.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nCases of H1N1v confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR negative cases with similar influenza-like illness (ILI controls) in 7 regions of England were sent two questionnaires, one within a week of symptom onset and one two weeks later, requesting information on duration of illness, work loss and antiviral use together with EQ-5D questionnaires.\n\n Results were compared with those for seasonal influenza from a systematic literature review.\n\n A total QALY loss for the 2009 pandemic in England was calculated based on the estimated total clinical cases and reported deaths.\n\n A total of 655 questionnaires were sent and 296 (45%) returned.\n\n Symptoms and average illness duration were similar between confirmed cases and ILI controls (8.8 days and 8.7 days respectively).\n\n Days off work were greater for cases than ILI controls (7.3 and 4.9 days respectively, p?=?0.003).\n\n The quality-adjusted life days lost was 2.92 for confirmed cases and 2.74 for ILI controls, with a reduction in QALY loss after prompt use of antivirals in confirmed cases.\n\n The overall QALY loss in the pandemic was estimated at 28,126 QALYs (22,267 discounted) of which 40% was due to deaths (24% with discounting).\n\n\nConclusion\nGiven the global public health significance of influenza, it is remarkable that no previous prospective study of the QALY loss of influenza using standardised and well validated methods has been performed.\n\n Although the QALY loss was minor for individual patients, the estimated total burden of influenza over the pandemic was substantial when compared to other infectious diseases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3047534","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Albert Jan","surname":"van Hoek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anthony","surname":"Underwood","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Jit","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elizabeth","surname":"Miller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"W.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study","abstract":"Background\nAn outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95?333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Adam J","surname":"Kucharski","email":"adam.kucharski@lshtm.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Timothy W","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charlie","surname":"Diamond","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Edmunds","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rosalind M","surname":"Eggo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fiona","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Jit","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James D","surname":"Munday","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicholas","surname":"Davies","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Gimma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"van Zandvoort","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hamish","surname":"Gibbs","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joel","surname":"Hellewell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher I","surname":"Jarvis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Clifford","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Billy J","surname":"Quilty","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nikos I","surname":"Bosse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Abbott","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Petra","surname":"Klepac","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Flasche","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The transmissibility of novel Coronavirus in the early stages of the 2019-20 outbreak in Wuhan: exploring initial point-source exposure sizes and durations using scenario analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections among travellers from Wuhan, China, 20-28 January 2020","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Stage-structured transmission of phocine distemper virus in the Dutch 2002 outbreak","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The stage-structured epidemic: linking disease and demography with a multi-state matrix approach model","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The contribution of pre-symptomatic transmission to the COVID-19 outbreak.

broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.\n\n We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.\n\n\nConclusions\nHydroxychloroquine was found to

assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nMethods\nUtilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made.\n\n\nResults\nInadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries.\n\n Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic.\n\n Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport.\n\n The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed.\n\n Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of
