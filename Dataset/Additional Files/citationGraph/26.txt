study","abstract":"Background\nInfluenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality despite available treatments.\n\n Anecdotal reports suggest that plasma with high antibody titres to influenza might be of benefit in the treatment of severe influenza.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial, 29 academic medical centres in the USA assessed the safety and efficacy of anti-influenza plasma with haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres of 1:80 or more to the infecting strain.\n\n Hospitalised children and adults (including pregnant women) with severe influenza A or B (defined as the presence of hypoxia or tachypnoea) were randomly assigned to receive either two units (or paediatric equivalent) of anti-influenza plasma plus standard care, versus standard care alone, and were followed up for 28 days.\n\n The primary endpoint was time to normalisation of patients' respiratory status (respiratory rate of ?20 breaths per min for adults or age-defined thresholds of 20–38 breaths per min for children) and a room air oxygen saturation of 93% or more.\n\n This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, number NCT01052480.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Jan 13, 2011, and March 2, 2015, 113 participants were screened for eligibility and 98 were randomly assigned from 20 out of 29 participating sites.\n\n Of the participants with confirmed influenza (by PCR), 28 (67%) of 42 in the plasma plus standard care group normalised their respiratory status by day 28 compared with 24 (53%) of 45 participants on standard care alone (p=0·069).\n\n The hazard ratio (HR) comparing plasma plus standard care with standard care alone was 1·71 (95% CI 0·96–3·06).\n\n Six participants died, one (2%) from the plasma plus standard care group and five (10%) from the standard care group (HR 0·19 [95% CI 0·02–1·65], p=0·093).\n\n Participants in the plasma plus standard care group had non-significant reductions in days in hospital (median 6 days [IQR 4–16] vs 11 days [5–25], p=0·13) and days on mechanical ventilation (median 0 days [IQR 0–6] vs 3 days [0–14], p=0·14).\n\n Fewer plasma plus standard care participants had serious adverse events compared with standard care alone recipients (nine [20%] of 46 vs 20 [38%] of 52, p=0·041), the most frequent of which were acute respiratory distress syndrome (one [2%] vs two [4%] patients) and stroke (one [2%] vs two [4%] patients).\n\n\nInterpretation\nAlthough there was no significant effect of plasma treatment on the primary endpoint, the treatment seemed safe and well tolerated.\n\n A phase 3 randomised trial is now underway to further assess this intervention.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, US National Institutes of

expert groups recommended mortality trials of four repurposed antiviral drugs — remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1a — in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).\n\n\nMethods\nWe randomly assigned inpatients with Covid-19 equally between one of the trial drug regimens that was locally available and open control (up to five options, four active and the local standard of care).\n\n The intention-to-treat primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality in the four pairwise comparisons of each trial drug and its control (drug available but patient assigned to the same care without that drug).\n\n Rate ratios for death were calculated with stratification according to age and status regarding mechanical ventilation at trial entry.\n\n\nResults\nAt 405 hospitals in 30 countries, 11,330 adults underwent randomization; 2750 were assigned to receive remdesivir, 954 to hydroxychloroquine, 1411 to lopinavir (without interferon), 2063 to interferon (including 651 to interferon plus lopinavir), and 4088 to no trial drug.\n\n Adherence was 94 to 96% midway through treatment, with 2 to 6% crossover.\n\n In total, 1253 deaths were reported (median day of death, day 8; interquartile range, 4 to 14).\n\n The Kaplan–Meier 28-day mortality was 11.8% (39.0% if the patient was already receiving ventilation at randomization and 9.5% otherwise).\n\n Death occurred in 301 of 2743 patients receiving remdesivir and in 303 of 2708 receiving its control (rate ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.11; P=0.50), in 104 of 947 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and in 84 of 906 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.59; P=0.23), in 148 of 1399 patients receiving lopinavir

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n\n However, the actual number of infections in people who have had contact with camels is unknown and most index patients cannot recall any such contact.\n\n We aimed to do a nationwide serosurvey in Saudi Arabia to establish the prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies, both in the general population and in populations of individuals who have maximum exposure to camels.\n\n\nMethods\nIn the cross-sectional serosurvey, we tested human serum samples obtained from healthy individuals older than 15 years who attended primary health-care centres or participated in a national burden-of-disease study in all 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia.\n\n Additionally, we tested serum samples from shepherds and abattoir workers with occupational exposure to camels.\n\n Samples were screened by recombinant ELISA and MERS-CoV seropositivity was confirmed by recombinant immunofluorescence and plaque reduction neutralisation tests.\n\n We used two-tailed Mann Whitney U exact tests, ?2, and Fisher's exact tests to analyse the data.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Dec 1, 2012, and Dec 1, 2013, we obtained individual serum samples from 10?009 individuals.\n\n Anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were confirmed in 15 (0·15%; 95% CI 0·09–0·24) of 10?009 people in six of the 13 provinces.\n\n The mean age of seropositive individuals was significantly younger than that of patients with reported, laboratory-confirmed, primary Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (43·5 years [SD 17·3] vs 53·8 years [17·5]; p=0·008).\n\n Men had a higher antibody prevalence than did women (11 [0·25%] of 4341 vs two [0·05%] of 4378; p=0·028) and antibody prevalence was significantly higher in central versus coastal provinces (14 [0·26%] of 5479 vs one [0·02%] of 4529; p=0·003).\n\n Compared with the general population, seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly increased by 15 times in shepherds (two [2·3%] of 87, p=0·0004) and by 23 times in slaughterhouse workers (five [3·6%] of 140; p&lt;0·0001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nSeroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population.\n\n By simple multiplication, a projected 44?951 (95% CI 26?971–71?922) individuals older than 15 years might be seropositive for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia.\n\n These individuals might be the source of infection for patients with confirmed MERS who had no previous exposure to camels.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union, German Centre for Infection Research, Federal Ministry of Education and

individuals who had been hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the year following their discharge from the hospital.\n\n Parameters studied included serum levels of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) IgG antibody, tests of lung function, and imaging data to evaluate changes in lung fibrosis.\n\n In addition, we explored the incidence of femoral head necrosis in some of the individuals recovering from SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nThe subjects of this study were 383 clinically diagnosed SARS patients in Beijing, China.\n\n They were tested regularly for serum levels of SARS-CoV IgG antibody and lung function and were given chest X-rays and/or high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) examinations at the Chinese PLA General Hospital during the 12 months that followed their release from the hospital.\n\n Those individuals who were found to have lung diffusion abnormities (transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide [DLCO] &lt; 80% of predicted value [pred]) received regular lung function tests and HRCT examinations in the follow-up phase in order to document the changes in their lung condition.\n\n Some patients who complained of joint pain were given magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of their femoral heads.\n\n\nFindings\nOf all the subjects, 81.2% (311 of 383 patients) tested positive for serum SARS-CoV IgG.\n\n Of those testing positive, 27.3% (85 of 311 patients) were suffering from lung diffusion abnormities (DLCO &lt; 80% pred) and 21.5% (67 of 311 patients) exhibited lung fibrotic changes.\n\n In the 12 month duration of this study, all of the 40 patients with lung diffusion abnormities who were examined exhibited some improvement of lung function and fibrosis detected by radiography.\n\n Of the individuals receiving MRI examinations, 23.1% (18 of 78 patients) showed signs of femoral head necrosis.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe lack of sero-positive SARS-CoV in some individuals suggests that there may have been some misdiagnosed cases among the subjects included in this study.\n\n Of those testing positive, the serum levels of SARS-CoV IgG antibody decreased significantly during the 12 months after hospital discharge.\n\n Additionally, we found that the individuals who had lung fibrosis showed some spontaneous recovery.\n\n Finally, some of the subjects developed femoral head necrosis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC545044","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lixin","surname":"Xie","email":"xielx@301hospital.com.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Youning","surname":"Liu","email":"liuyn@301hospital.com.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Baoxing","surname":"Fan","email":"fanbx@263.net.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yueyong","surname":"Xiao","email":"xiaoyuryong@vip.sina.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"Tian","email":"tianqing777@sohu.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liangan","surname":"Chen","email":"chenliangan@301hospital.com.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Zhao","email":"liuyn@301hospital.com.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weijun","surname":"Chen","email":"chenweijun72@sohu.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1017/S0950268800048019","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The

health.\n However, no specific antiviral agents are available for its treatment.\n In this work, we explore the feasibility of convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue severe patients.\n The results from 10 severe adult cases showed that one dose (200 mL) of CP was well tolerated and could significantly increase or maintain the neutralizing antibodies at a high level, leading to disappearance of viremia in 7 d.\n Meanwhile, clinical symptoms and paraclinical criteria rapidly improved within 3 d.\n Radiological examination showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d.\n These results indicate that CP can serve as a promising rescue option for severe COVID-19, while the randomized trial is

While our current understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis is limited, a better understanding will help us develop efficacious treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19. One potential therapeutic target is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n ACE2 primarily catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to a nonapeptide angiotensin or the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and has direct effects on cardiac function and multiple organs via counter-regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).\n Significant to COVID-19, ACE2 is postulated to serve as a major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, as it does for SARS-CoV.\n Many infected individuals develop COVID-19 with fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress to pneumonia.\n Disease progression promotes the activation of immune cells, platelets, and coagulation pathways that can lead to multiple organ failure and death.\n ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells of the lungs at high level, a major target of the disease, as seen in post-mortem lung tissue of patients who died with COVID-19, which reveals diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates bilaterally.\n Comparatively, ACE2 is expressed at low level by vascular endothelial cells of the heart and kidney but may also be targeted by the virus in severe COVID-19 cases.\n Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulates ACE2 expression, which may also play a critical pathogenic role in COVID-19. Importantly, targeting ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis and blocking ACE2 interaction with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to curtail SARS-CoV-2 infection are becoming very attractive therapeutics potential for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Here, we will discuss the following subtopics: 1) ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2; 2) clinical and pathological features of COVID-19; 3) role of ACE2 in the infection and pathogenesis of SARS; 4) potential pathogenic role of ACE2 in COVID-19; 5) animal models for pathological studies and therapeutics; and 6) therapeutics development for

median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea,

and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days.\n\n The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo).\n\n Those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (95%

from 336 hospitalized patients using the propensity-score matching (PSM) technique using age, MEWS score, and comorbidities.\n\n The primary outcome was mortality rate; secondary outcomes were the requirement of a ventilator, length of ventilator need, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and length of overall hospital confinement.\n\n Additionally, parameters predicting death in COVID-19 patients were identified.\n\n\nResults\nFindings confirmed a significantly lower mortality rate in the PG versus the CG (13.7% vs.\n\n 34.3 %, p?=?0.001) and a significant difference in the cumulative

Participants:\nAn open label, two-arm, phase-II clinical trial conducted across 22 hospitals from Saudi Arabia.\n\n The intervention group included 40 adults (aged ?18 years) with confirmed severe COVID-19 and the control group included 124 patients matched using propensity score for age, gender, intubation status, and history of diabetes and/or hypertension.\n\n Intervention group included those (a) with severe symptoms (dyspnea; respiratory rate, ?30/min; SpO2, ?93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, &lt;300; and/or lung infiltrates &gt;50% within 24–48 h), (b) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care or (c) experiencing life-threatening conditions.\n\n The control group included confirmed severe COVID-19 patients of similar characteristics who did not consent for CP infusion or were not able to receive CP due to its nonavailability.\n\n\nInterventions:\nThe intervention group participants were infused 300 ml (200–400 ml/treatment dose) CP at least once, and if required, daily for up to 5 sessions, along with receiving the best standard of care.\n\n The control group only received the best standard of care.\n\n\nOutcomes:\nThe primary endpoints were safety and ICU length of stay (LOS).\n\n The secondary endpoints included 30-day mortality, days on mechanical ventilation and days to clinical recovery.\n\n\nResults:\nCP transfusion did not result in any adverse effects.\n\n There was no difference in the ICU LOS (median 8 days in both groups).\n\n The mortality risk was lower in the CP group: 13% absolute risk reduction (P = 0.147), hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.554 (0.299–1.027; P = 0.061) by log-rank test.\n\n There was no significant difference in the days on mechanical ventilation and days to clinical recovery.\n\n\nConclusion:\nCP containing

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early CP therapy in COVID-19 progression.\n\n\nMethods and findings\nThe study was an open-label, single-center randomized clinical trial performed in an academic medical center in Santiago, Chile, from May 10, 2020, to July 18, 2020, with final follow-up until August 17, 2020. The trial included patients hospitalized within the first 7 days of COVID-19 symptom onset, presenting risk factors for illness progression and not on mechanical ventilation.\n\n The intervention consisted of immediate CP (early plasma group) versus no CP unless developing prespecified criteria of deterioration (deferred plasma group).\n\n Additional standard treatment was allowed in both arms.\n\n The primary outcome was a composite of mechanical ventilation, hospitalization for &gt;14 days, or death.\n\n The key secondary outcomes included time to respiratory failure, days of mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, mortality at 30 days, and SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR clearance rate.\n\n Of 58 randomized patients (mean age, 65.8 years; 50% male), 57 (98.3%) completed the trial.\n\n A total of 13 (43.3%) participants from the deferred group received plasma based on clinical aggravation.\n\n We failed to find benefit in the primary outcome (32.1% versus 33.3%, odds ratio [OR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.32–2.84, p &gt; 0.999) in the early versus deferred CP group.\n\n The in-hospital mortality rate was 17.9% versus 6.7% (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.54–17.17 p = 0.246), mechanical ventilation 17.9% versus 6.7% (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.54–17.17, p = 0.246), and prolonged hospitalization 21.4% versus 30.0% (OR 0.64, 95% CI, 0.19–2.10, p = 0.554) in the early versus deferred CP group,

within 6 hours after plasma transfusion.\n\n The main limitation of this study is the lack of statistical power to detect a smaller but clinically relevant therapeutic effect of CP, as well as not having confirmed neutralizing antibodies in donor before plasma infusion.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn the present study, we failed to find evidence of benefit in mortality, length of hospitalization, or

Different assays were used: a commercial ELISA detecting antibodies against the recombinant spike protein (S1); a multiplex assay detecting total and specific antibody isotypes against three

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU

Effect of Age on Mortality in Patients With COVID-19: A Meta-Analysis With 611,583 Subjects","abstract":"Objectives\nInitial data on COVID-19 infection has pointed out a special vulnerability of older adults.\n\n\nDesign\nWe performed a meta-analysis with available national reports on May 7, 2020 from China, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and New York State.\n\n Analyses were performed by a random effects model, and sensitivity analyses were performed for the identification of potential sources of heterogeneity.\n\n\nSetting and participants\nCOVID-19–positive patients reported in literature and national reports.\n\n\nMeasures\nAll-cause mortality by age.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 611,1583 subjects were analyzed and 141,745 (23.2%) were aged ?80 years.\n\n The percentage of octogenarians was different in the 5 registries, the lowest being in China (3.2%) and the highest in the United Kingdom and New York State.\n\n The overall mortality rate was 12.10% and it varied widely between countries, the lowest being in China (3.1%) and the highest in the United Kingdom (20.8%) and New York State (20.99%).\n\n Mortality was &lt;1.1% in patients aged &lt;50 years and it increased exponentially after that age in the 5 national registries.\n\n As expected, the highest mortality rate was observed in patients aged ?80 years.\n\n All age groups had significantly higher mortality compared with the immediately younger age group.\n\n The largest increase in mortality risk was observed in patients aged 60 to 69 years compared with those aged 50 to 59 years (odds ratio 3.13, 95% confidence interval 2.61-3.76).\n\n\nConclusions and Implications\nThis meta-analysis with more than half million of COVID-19 patients from different countries highlights the determinant effect of age on mortality with the relevant thresholds on age &gt;50 years and, especially, &gt;60 years.\n\n Older adult patients should be prioritized in the implementation of preventive measures.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7247470","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Clara","surname":"Bonanad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sergio","surname":"García-Blas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francisco","surname":"Tarazona-Santabalbina","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juan","surname":"Sanchis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vicente","surname":"Bertomeu-González","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lorenzo","surname":"Fácila","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Albert","surname":"Ariza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julio","surname":"Núñez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alberto","surname":"Cordero","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References

lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays.\n\n\nFindings\nOf the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts [0·6 (0·6-0·8)] but increases in neutrophil counts [4·7 (3·6-5·8)] than 27 mild cases [1.1 (0·8-1·4); 2·0 (1·5-2·9)].\n\n Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-? levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases.\n\n T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases.\n\n Moreover, the

pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or

implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences,

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in

viral RNA was still present in three patients’ urine specimens after throat swabs were negative.\n\n Using a multiple linear regression model (F?=?2.669, P?=?0.044, and adjusted R2?=?0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients’ stools (t?=??2.699, P?=?0.010).\n\n The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs.\n\n 8.0 days, respectively; t?=?2.550, P?=?0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs.\n\n 11 days, respectively; t?=?4.631, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P?&gt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions:\nIn brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients’ stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence.\n\n Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease.\n\n The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shui-Bao","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi-Xiao","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Di","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Qin","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bi-Jie","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"En-Qiang","surname":"Mao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wen-Hong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong-Zhou","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Lan, L. et al.

recently emerged to cause a human pandemic.\n Although molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet urgently needed.\n Validated serologic assays are needed for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir, and epidemiologic studies.\n We developed serologic assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike protein–specific, and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies.\n Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs.\n We demonstrated that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2–infected persons seroconverted by 2 weeks after disease onset.\n We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity, and sensitivity varied between the 2 assays; the IgA ELISA showed higher sensitivity.\n Overall, the validated assays described can be instrumental for detection of SARS-CoV-2–specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiologic, and vaccine evaluation studies.\n","id":"PMC7323511","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nisreen M.A.","surname":"Okba","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marcel

a Clinically Proven Protease Inhibitor","abstract":"The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency.\n Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases.\n Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets.\n Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.\n A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option.\n Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.\n Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral

of Cynomolgus Macaques (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) Results in Virus Replication in Ciliated Epithelial Cells and Pneumocytes with Associated Lesions throughout the Respiratory Tract","abstract":"A substantial proportion of hitherto unexplained respiratory tract illnesses is associated with human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection.\n This virus also was found in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n To determine the dynamics and associated lesions of hMPV infection, six cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were inoculated with hMPV and examined by pathological and virological assays.\n They were euthanized at 5 (n = 2) or 9 (n = 2) days post-infection (dpi), or monitored until 14 dpi (n = 2).\n Viral excretion peaked at 4 dpi and decreased to zero by 10 dpi.\n Viral replication was restricted to the respiratory tract and associated with minimal to mild, multi-focal erosive and inflammatory changes in conducting airways, and increased numbers of macrophages in alveoli.\n Viral expression was seen mainly at the apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract, and less frequently in type 1 pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages.\n Both cell tropism and respiratory lesions were distinct from those of SARS-associated coronavirus infection, excluding hMPV as the primary cause of SARS.\n This study demonstrates that hMPV is a respiratory pathogen and indicates that viral replication is short-lived, polarized to the apical surface, and occurs primarily in ciliated respiratory epithelial cells.\n","id":"PMC1615765","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thijs","surname":"Kuiken","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bernadette

(screened 22 April to 14 July 2020) with confirmed moderate covid-19 (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio between 200 mm Hg and 300 mm Hg or a respiratory rate of more than 24/min with oxygen saturation 93% or less on room air): 235 were assigned to convalescent plasma with best standard of care (intervention arm) and 229 to best standard of care only (control arm).\n\n\nInterventions\nParticipants in the intervention arm received two doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma, transfused 24 hours apart.\n\n The presence and levels of neutralising antibodies were not measured a priori; stored samples were assayed at the end of the study.\n\n\nMain outcome measure\nComposite of progression to severe disease (PaO2/FiO2 &lt;100 mm Hg)

not associated with a reduction in progression to severe covid-19 or all cause mortality.\n\n This trial has high generalisability and approximates convalescent plasma use in real life settings with

The primary outcome was death within 30 days after plasma transfusion.\n\n Patients who were enrolled through July 4, 2020, and for whom data on anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in plasma transfusions and on 30-day mortality were available were included in the analysis.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 3082 patients included in this analysis, death within 30 days after plasma transfusion occurred in 115 of 515 patients (22.3%) in the high-titer group, 549 of 2006 patients (27.4%) in the medium-titer group, and 166 of 561 patients (29.6%) in the low-titer group.\n\n The association of anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels with the risk of death from Covid-19 was moderated by mechanical ventilation status.\n\n A lower risk of death within 30 days in the high-titer group than in the low-titer group was observed among patients who had not received mechanical ventilation before transfusion (relative risk, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.91), and no effect on the risk of death was observed among patients who had received mechanical ventilation (relative risk, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.32).\n\n\nConclusions\nAmong patients hospitalized with Covid-19 who were not receiving mechanical ventilation, transfusion of plasma with higher anti–SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels was associated with a lower risk of death than transfusion of plasma with lower antibody levels.\n\n (Funded by the Department of Health and Human Services and others;

Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19 — Preliminary Report","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage.\n\n Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care.\n\n Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P&lt;0.001).\n\n The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization.\n\n In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs.\n\n 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs.\n\n 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs.\n\n 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.\n\n (Funded by the Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health Research and others; RECOVERY ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov number, NCT04381936;

moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in adults in India.\n\n\nDesign\nOpen label, parallel arm, phase II, multicentre, randomised controlled trial.\n\n\nSetting\n39 public and private hospitals across India.\n\n\nParticipants\n464 adults (?18 years) admitted to hospital (screened 22 April to 14 July 2020) with confirmed moderate covid-19 (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio between 200 mm Hg and 300 mm Hg or a respiratory rate of more than 24/min with oxygen saturation 93% or less on room air): 235 were assigned to convalescent plasma with best standard of care (intervention arm) and 229 to best standard of care only (control arm).\n\n\nInterventions\nParticipants in the intervention arm received two doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma, transfused 24 hours apart.\n\n The presence and levels of neutralising antibodies were not measured a priori; stored samples were assayed at the end of the study.\n\n\nMain outcome measure\nComposite of progression to severe disease (PaO2/FiO2 &lt;100 mm Hg) or all cause mortality at 28 days post-enrolment.\n\n\nResults\nProgression to severe disease or all cause mortality at 28 days after enrolment occurred in 44 (19%) participants in the intervention arm and 41 (18%) in the control arm (risk difference 0.008 (95% confidence interval ?0.062 to 0.078); risk ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.54).\n\n\nConclusion\nConvalescent plasma was not associated with a reduction in progression to severe covid-19 or all cause mortality.\n\n This trial has high generalisability and approximates convalescent plasma use in real life settings with limited laboratory capacity.\n\n A priori measurement of neutralising antibody titres in donors and participants might further clarify the role of convalescent plasma in the management of covid-19.\nTrial registration\nClinical Trial Registry of India

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug

developed protective antibodies.\n The most recent on-going epidemic is caused by the Ebola virus, a filovirus responsible for Ebola virus disease, a severe, often lethal, hemorrhagic fever.\n Recently, the use of convalescent blood products was proposed by the WHO as one early option for treating patients with Ebola virus disease.\n This publication provides an overview of the various convalescent blood products and technological options that could theoretically be considered when there is a need to rely on this therapeutic approach.\n In countries without access to advanced blood-processing technologies, the choice may initially be restricted to convalescent whole blood or plasma.\n In technologically advanced countries, additional options for convalescent blood products are available, including virally inactivated plasma and fractionated immunoglobulins.\n The preparation of minipool immunoglobulins is also a realistic option to

clinical data on H5N1 cases are limited.\n\n We conducted a retrospective study of 26 confirmed human H5N1 cases identified through surveillance in China from October 2005 through April 2008.\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nData were collected from hospital medical records of H5N1 cases and analyzed.\n\n The median age was 29 years (range 6–62) and 58% were female.\n\n Many H5N1 cases reported fever (92%) and cough (58%) at illness onset, and had lower respiratory findings of tachypnea and dyspnea at admission.\n\n All cases progressed rapidly to bilateral pneumonia.\n\n Clinical complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 81%), cardiac failure (50%), elevated aminotransaminases (43%), and renal dysfunction (17%).\n\n Fatal cases had a lower median nadir platelet count (64.5×109 cells/L vs 93.0×109 cells/L, p?=?0.02), higher median peak lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level (1982.5 U/L vs 1230.0 U/L, p?=?0.001), higher percentage of ARDS (94%

survived compared to untreated (67% [8/12] vs 7% [1/14], p?=?0.003).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThe clinical course of Chinese H5N1 cases is characterized by fever and cough initially, with rapid progression to lower respiratory disease.\n\n Decreased platelet count, elevated LDH level, ARDS and cardiac failure were associated with fatal outcomes.\n\n Clinical management of H5N1 cases should be standardized in China to include early antiviral treatment for suspected H5N1 cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2515635","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hongjie","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuelong","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Huai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luzhao","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhibin","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhongjie","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cuiling","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junhua","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chengping","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoling","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuecheng","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zigui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Longshan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yusheng","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huiming","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liping","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xianfeng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianbao","surname":"Xin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junqiao","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qiuyue","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhengan","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Longnv","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kunzhao","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinye","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoning","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shichang","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lanjuan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinquan","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erdang","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pingping","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shui

11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health.\n Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine.\n Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV.\n Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM).\n The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD.\n These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections.\n Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.\ng.\n m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that

Antibodies against common HCoV strains were measured by enzyme?linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization assay comparing older adults with cardiopulmonary diseases (99 subjects) to younger, healthy adults (101 subjects).\n Virus shedding was detected in respiratory secretions by polymerase chain reaction.\n Of 43 HCoV?associated illnesses, 15 (35%) occurred in 14 older adults (aged ?60 years) and 28 (65%) in 28 younger adults (aged 21?40 years).\n Binding and neutralizing antibodies were higher in older adults.\n Only 16 (35.7%) of RI with increases in binding antibodies also had increases in neutralizing antibodies to HCoV.\n Increases in binding antibodies with RI were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and virus shedding, and more frequent in younger compared to older adults.\n Functional neutralizing antibodies were not stimulated as often as binding antibodies, explaining in part a susceptibility to reinfection with HCoV.\n Monitoring binding antibodies may be more sensitive for the serologic detection of HCoV infections.\n","id":"PMC7166442","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Geoffrey J.","surname":"Gorse","email":"gorsegj@slu.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mary M.","surname":"Donovan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Mary M.","surname":"Donovan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gira B.","surname":"Patel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/rmv.2107","date":"2020-03-24","title":"Immune responses and pathogenesis of <styled-content style='fixed-case' toggle='no'>SARS?CoV</styled-content>?2 during an outbreak in Iran: Comparison with <styled-content style='fixed-case' toggle='no'>SARS</styled-content> and <styled-content style='fixed-case' toggle='no'>MERS</styled-content>\n","abstract":"The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID?19, an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS?CoV?2, an important pathogen for humans.\n There is an urgent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread.\n In Iran, the first case of the COVID?19 was reported after spread from China and other countries.\n Fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms of this virus.\n In worldwide, the incubation period of COVID?19 was 3 to 7?days and approximately 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe, requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation.\n To mount an antiviral response, the innate immune system recognizes molecular structures that are produced by the invasion of the virus.\n COVID?19 infection induces IgG antibodies against N protein that can be detected by serum as early as day 4 after the onset of disease and with most patients seroconverting by day 14. Laboratory evidence of clinical patients showed that a specific T?cell response against SARS?CoV?2 is important for the recognition and killing of infected cells, particularly in the lungs of infected individuals.\n At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID?19 and the main treatments are supportive.\n In this review, we investigated the innate and acquired immune responses in patients who recovered from COVID?19, which could inform the design of prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapy for the

that anti-inflammatory effects of IVIg are mainly mediated by ?2,6-sialylated Fc fragments.\n These reports further suggest that ?2,6-sialylated Fc fragments interact with DC-SIGN+ cells to release IL-33 that subsequently expands IL-4-producing basophils.\n However, translational insights on these observations are lacking.\n Here we show that IVIg therapy in rheumatic patients leads to significant raise in plasma IL-33. However, IL-33 was not contributed by human DC-SIGN+ dendritic cells and splenocytes.\n As IL-33 has been shown to expand basophils, we analyzed the proportion of circulating basophils in these patients following IVIg therapy.\n In contrast to mice data, IVIg therapy led to basophil expansion only in two patients who also showed increased plasma levels of IL-33. Importantly, the fold-changes in IL-33 and basophils were not correlated and we could hardly detect IL-4 in the plasma following IVIg therapy.\n Thus, our results indicate that IVIg-induced IL-33 is insufficient to mediate basophil expansion in autoimmune patients.\n Hence, IL-33 and basophil-mediated anti-inflammatory mechanism proposed for IVIg might not be pertinent in

infiltration and the severity of bortezomib-induced peripheral neurotoxicity in rats","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is a severe adverse effect in patients receiving antitumor agents, and no effective treatment is available.\n\n Although the mechanisms responsible for the development of CIPN are poorly understood, recent findings make neuroinflammation an attractive target to be investigated, particularly when neuropathic pain is a prominent feature such as after bortezomib administration.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par3'>After determination of a suitable schedule based on a preliminary pharmacokinetic pilot study, female Wistar rats were treated with IVIg 1 g/kg every 2 weeks.\n\n IVIg treatment was started at the beginning of bortezomib administration (“preventive” schedule), or once BIPN was already ensued after 4 weeks of treatment (“therapeutic” schedule).\n\n Neurophysiological and behavioral studies were performed to assess the extent of painful peripheral neurotoxicity induced by bortezomib, and these functional assessments were completed by pathologic examination of peripheral nerves and intraepidermal nerve fiber quantification (IENF).\n\n The role of the innate immune response in BIPN was investigated by immunochemistry characterization of macrophage infiltration in peripheral nerves.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par4'>Both schedules of IVIg administration were able to significantly reduce bortezomib-induced heat and mechanical allodynia.\n\n Although these changes were not evidenced at the neurophysiological examination of peripheral nerves, they behavioral effects were paralleled in the animals treated with the preventive schedule by reduced axonopathy in peripheral nerves and significant protection from loss of IENF.\n\n Moreover, IVIg administration was very effective in reducing infiltration in peripheral nerves of macrophages with the M1, pro-inflammatory phenotype.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par5'>Our results suggest a prominent role of neuroinflammation in BIPN and that IVIg might be considered as a possible safe and effective therapeutic option preventing M1 macrophage infiltration.\n\n However, since neuropathic pain is frequent also in other CIPN types, it also indicates the need for further investigation in other forms of CIPN.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6103882","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cristina","surname":"Meregalli","email":"cristina.meregalli@unimib.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ivan","surname":"Marjanovic","email":"I.Marjanovic@kedrion.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carla","surname":"Scali","email":"C.Scali@kedrion.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Monza","email":"l.monza@campus.unimib.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nadia","surname":"Spinoni","email":"n.spinoni@asst-monza.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cristina","surname":"Galliani","email":"c.galliani@asst-monza.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rinaldo","surname":"Brivio","email":"r.brivio@asst-monza.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alessia","surname":"Chiorazzi","email":"alessia.chiorazzi@unimib.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elisa","surname":"Ballarini","email":"elisa.ballarini@unimib.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Virginia","surname":"Rodriguez-Menendez","email":"virginia.rodriguez1@unimib.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Valentina

therapy is available for treatment of virus infection.\n Convalescent plasma has been considered a potential modality for COVID-19 infection.\n One hundred eighty-nine COVID-19 positive patients including 115 patients in plasma therapy group and 74 patients in control group, registered in the hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 infection, entered this multi-center clinical study.\n Comparison of outcomes including all-cause mortality, total hospitalization days and patients’ need for intubation between the two patient groups shows that total of 98 (98.2 %) of patients who received convalescent plasma were discharged from hospital which is substantially higher compared to 56 (78.7 %) patients in control group.\n Length of hospitalization days was significantly lower (9.54 days) in convalescent plasma group compared with that of control group (12.88 days).\n Only 8 patients (7%) in convalescent plasma group required intubation while that was 20 % in control group.\n This clinical study provides strong evidence to support the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 patients and recommends this treatment for management of these patients.\n Clinical efficacy, immediate availability and potential cost effectiveness could be considered as main advantages of convalescent plasma therapy.\n","id":"PMC7362821","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hassan","surname":"Abolghasemi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peyman","surname":"Eshghi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abdol

recovered patients has been a therapeutic modality employed for over a hundred years for various infectious pathogens.\n Specifically, it has been used in the treatment of many viral infections with varying degrees of clinical efficacy.\n As we consider the use of convalescent plasma in the battle against this new strain of coronavirus, it is prudent to review what is known from past experiences.\n Accordingly, the aim of this review is to examine in detail studies of convalescent plasma used during previous viral outbreaks and pandemics with particular focus on hemorrhagic fevers, influenza, and other coronaviruses.\n The concluding sections of this review address the potential use of convalescent plasma during the present-day SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, not only insofar as its clinical benefit but also the steps required to make convalescent plasma treatments readily available for an exponentially growing patient population.\n By the end, the authors hope to address the extent to which convalescent plasma represents a realistic therapeutic approach, or a distraction from other potentially useful treatments.\n","id":"PMC7179481","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"H.

worldwide.\n However, so far no approved vaccine or drug therapy is available for treatment of virus infection.\n Convalescent plasma has been considered a potential modality for COVID-19 infection.\n One hundred eighty-nine COVID-19 positive patients including 115 patients in plasma therapy group and 74 patients in control group, registered in the hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 infection, entered this multi-center clinical study.\n Comparison of outcomes including all-cause mortality, total hospitalization days and patients’ need for intubation between the two patient groups shows that total of 98 (98.2 %) of patients who received convalescent plasma were discharged from hospital which is substantially higher compared to 56 (78.7 %) patients in control group.\n Length of hospitalization days was significantly lower (9.54 days) in convalescent plasma group compared with that of control group (12.88 days).\n Only 8 patients (7%) in convalescent plasma group required

We present herein the results of an interim analysis of 316 patients enrolled at Houston Methodist hospitals from March 28 to July 6, 2020. Of the 316 transfused patients, 136 met a 28-day outcome and were matched to 251 non-transfused control COVID-19 patients.\n Matching criteria included age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, and baseline ventilation requirement 48 hours from admission, and in a second matching analysis, ventilation status at day 0. Variability in the timing of transfusion relative to admission and titer of antibodies of plasma transfused allowed for analysis in specific matched cohorts.\n The analysis showed a significant reduction (P = 0.047) in mortality within 28 days, specifically in patients transfused within 72 hours of admission with plasma with an anti-spike protein receptor binding domain titer of ?1:1350. These data suggest that treatment of COVID-19 with high anti–receptor binding domain IgG titer convalescent plasma is efficacious in early-disease patients.\n","id":"PMC7417901","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Salazar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul A.","surname":"Christensen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward A.","surname":"Graviss","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Duc T.","surname":"Nguyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Brian","surname":"Castillo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bevin V.","surname":"Lopez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Todd N.","surname":"Eagar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Yi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Picheng","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Rogers","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ahmed","surname":"Shehabeldin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Joseph","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Leveque","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Randall J.","surname":"Olsen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David W.","surname":"Bernard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jimmy","surname":"Gollihar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James M.","surname":"Musser","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s12879-021-06829-7","date":"2021-10-28","title":"Association between convalescent plasma treatment and mortality in COVID-19: a collaborative systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Convalescent plasma has been widely used to treat COVID-19 and is under investigation in numerous randomized clinical trials, but results are publicly available only for a small number of trials.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the benefits of convalescent plasma treatment compared to placebo or no treatment and all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19, using data from all available randomized clinical trials, including unpublished and ongoing trials (Open Science Framework, https://doi.\n\norg/10.17605/OSF.\n\nIO/GEHFX).\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>In this collaborative systematic review and meta-analysis, clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), the Cochrane COVID-19 register, the LOVE database, and PubMed were searched until April 8, 2021.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early CP therapy in COVID-19 progression.\n\n\nMethods and findings\nThe study was an open-label, single-center randomized clinical trial performed in an academic medical center in Santiago, Chile, from May 10, 2020, to July 18, 2020, with final follow-up until August 17, 2020. The trial included patients hospitalized within the first 7 days of COVID-19 symptom onset, presenting risk factors for illness progression and not on mechanical ventilation.\n\n The intervention consisted of immediate CP (early plasma group) versus no CP unless developing prespecified criteria of deterioration (deferred plasma group).\n\n Additional standard treatment was allowed in both arms.\n\n The primary outcome was a composite of mechanical ventilation, hospitalization for &gt;14 days, or death.\n\n The key secondary outcomes included time to respiratory failure, days of mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, mortality at 30 days, and SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR clearance rate.\n\n Of 58 randomized patients (mean age, 65.8 years; 50% male), 57 (98.3%) completed the trial.\n\n A total of 13 (43.3%) participants from the deferred group received plasma based on clinical aggravation.\n\n We failed to find benefit in the primary outcome (32.1% versus 33.3%, odds ratio [OR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.32–2.84, p &gt; 0.999) in the early versus deferred CP group.\n\n The in-hospital mortality rate was 17.9% versus 6.7% (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.54–17.17 p = 0.246), mechanical ventilation 17.9% versus 6.7% (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.54–17.17, p = 0.246), and prolonged hospitalization 21.4% versus 30.0% (OR 0.64, 95% CI, 0.19–2.10, p = 0.554) in the early versus deferred CP group, respectively.\n\n The viral clearance rate on day 3 (26% versus 8%, p = 0.204) and day 7 (38% versus 19%, p = 0.374) did not differ between groups.\n\n Two patients experienced serious adverse events within 6 hours after plasma transfusion.\n\n The main limitation of this study is the lack of statistical power to detect a smaller but clinically relevant therapeutic effect of CP, as well as not having confirmed neutralizing antibodies in donor before plasma infusion.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn the present study, we failed to find evidence of benefit in mortality, length of hospitalization, or mechanical ventilation requirement by immediate addition of CP therapy in the early stages of COVID-19 compared to its use only in case of patient deterioration.\n\n\nTrial

Plasma Antibody Levels and the Risk of Death from Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nConvalescent plasma has been widely used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) under the presumption that such plasma contains potentially therapeutic antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that can be passively transferred to the plasma recipient.\n\n Whether convalescent plasma with high antibody levels rather than low antibody levels is associated with a lower risk of death is unknown.\n\n\nMethods\nIn a retrospective study based on a U.\n\nS.\n\n national registry, we determined the anti–SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels in convalescent plasma used to treat hospitalized adults with Covid-19. The primary outcome was death within 30 days after plasma transfusion.\n\n Patients who were enrolled through July 4, 2020, and for whom data on anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in plasma transfusions and on 30-day mortality were available were included in the analysis.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 3082 patients included in this analysis, death within 30 days after plasma transfusion occurred in 115 of 515 patients (22.3%) in the high-titer group, 549 of 2006 patients (27.4%) in the medium-titer group, and 166 of 561 patients (29.6%) in the low-titer group.\n\n The association of anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels with the risk of death from Covid-19 was moderated by mechanical ventilation status.\n\n A lower risk of death within 30 days in the high-titer group than in the low-titer group was observed among patients who had not received mechanical ventilation before transfusion (relative risk, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.91), and no effect on the risk of death was observed among patients who had received mechanical ventilation (relative risk, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.32).\n\n\nConclusions\nAmong patients hospitalized with Covid-19 who were not receiving mechanical ventilation, transfusion of plasma with higher anti–SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels was associated with a lower risk of death than transfusion of plasma with lower antibody levels.\n\n (Funded by the Department of Health and Human Services and others;

2019 (Covid-19) may prevent disease progression in acutely ill, high-risk patients with Covid-19.\nMethods\nIn this randomized, multicenter, single-blind trial, we assigned patients who were being treated in an emergency department for Covid-19 symptoms to receive either one unit of convalescent plasma with a high titer of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or placebo.\n\n All the patients were either 50 years of age or older or had one or more risk factors for disease progression.\n\n In addition, all the patients presented to the emergency department within 7 days after symptom onset and were in stable condition for outpatient management.\n\n The primary outcome was disease progression within 15 days after randomization, which was a composite of hospital admission for any reason, seeking emergency or urgent care, or death without hospitalization.\n\n Secondary outcomes included the worst severity of illness on an 8-category ordinal scale, hospital-free days within 30 days after randomization, and death from any cause.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 511 patients were enrolled in the trial (257 in the convalescent-plasma group

used to diagnose coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of COVID-19 patients.\n\n However, it is not clear whether testing for RNAaemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n The patients were divided into three groups according to the “Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition)” issued by the National Health Commission of China.\n\n The clinical and laboratory data were collected.\n\n The serum viral load and IL-6 levels were determined.\n\n .\n\n\nResults\nClinical characteristics analysis of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAaemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease.\n\n Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients.\n\n More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAaemia (R = 0.902).\n\n\nConclusions\nDetectable serum SARS-Cov-2 RNA(RNAaemia) in COVID-19 patients was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis.\n\n Because the elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm which could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients with an excessive

P = .\n\n04) and invasive mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 3.5%; P = .\n\n02).\n\n All 4 deaths occurred in individuals with detectable RNAemia.\n\n An additional 121 plasma samples from 28 individuals with RNAemia were assessed longitudinally, and RNA was detected for a maximum duration of 10 days.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrated a high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, and an association between RNAemia and clinical severity suggesting the potential utility of plasma viral testing as a prognostic indicator for COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7543277","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Catherine A","surname":"Hogan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bryan A","surname":"Stevens","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Malaya K","surname":"Sahoo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"ChunHong","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Natasha","surname":"Garamani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saurabh","surname":"Gombar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fumiko","surname":"Yamamoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kanagavel","surname":"Murugesan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jason","surname":"Kurzer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James","surname":"Zehnder","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benjamin A","surname":"Pinsky","email":"bpinsky@stanford.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/cid/ciaa1285","date":"2020-08-26","title":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 RNA in Serum as Predictor of Severe Outcome in Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Retrospective Cohort Study","abstract":"Background\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n This study aimed to determine if SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum at admission correlated with clinical outcome in COVID-19.\nMethods\nCOVID-19 patients admitted to the infectious diseases department of a tertiary level Swedish hospital and sampled for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum at admission during 10 April to 30 June 2020 were included.\n\n Primary outcomes were day 28 all-cause mortality and progress to critical disease.\n\n\nResults\nThe cohort (N?=?167) consisted of 106 SARS-CoV-2 RNA serum-negative and 61 serum-positive patients.\n\n Median sampling time for initial SARS-CoV-2 in serum was 1 day (interquartile range [IQR], 1–2 days) after admission, corresponding to day 10 (IQR, 8–12) after symptom onset.\n\n Median age was 53 years (IQR, 44–67 years) and 63 years (IQR, 52–74 years) for the serum–negative and -positive patients, respectively.\n\n In the serum-negative and -positive groups, 3 of 106 and 15 of 61 patients died, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum at hospital admission indicates a high risk of progression to critical disease and death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7499508","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Karl","surname":"Hagman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Magnus","surname":"Hedenstierna","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Magnus","surname":"Hedenstierna","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrik","surname":"Gille-Johnson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Berit","surname":"Hammas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Malin","surname":"Grabbe","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joakim","surname":"Dillner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Johan","surname":"Ursing","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/v12091045","date":"2020-09-15","title":"RNAemia Corresponds to Disease Severity and Antibody Response in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a global health emergency.\n To improve the understanding of the systemic component of SARS-CoV-2, we investigated if viral load dynamics in plasma and respiratory samples are associated with antibody response and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in plasma samples from 14 (44%) out of 32 patients.\n RNAemia was detected in 5 out of 6 fatal cases.\n Peak IgG values were significantly lower in mild/moderate than in severe (0.6 (interquartile range, IQR, 0.4–3.2) vs.\n 11.8 (IQR, 9.9–13.0), adjusted p = 0.003) or critical cases (11.29 (IQR, 8.3–12.0), adjusted p = 0.042).\n IgG titers were significantly associated with virus Ct (Cycle threshold) value in plasma and respiratory specimens ((ß = 0.4, 95% CI (confidence interval, 0.2;

This set includes three elements: a measure of viral burden (quantitative PCR or cycle threshold), a measure of patient survival (mortality at hospital discharge or at 60 days), and a measure of patient progression through the health-care system by use of the WHO Clinical Progression Scale, which reflects patient trajectory and resource use over the course of clinical illness.\n We urge

and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in

new pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) and the effect of oseltamivir treatment were uncertain.\n\n\nMethods\nA retrospective cohort study involving 145 consecutive patients with specimens positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the matrix and new H1 genes was conducted.\n\n\nResults\nThe nontreated and oseltamivir-treated patients were comparable in their viral load at presentation, demography, and the presenting symptoms.\n\n No correlation was observed between viral load with age and number of symptoms.\n\n Viral load of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was significantly lower in treated than in nontreated patients at day 5 after symptom onset.\n\n When oseltamivir was initiated ? 2 days after symptom onset, a greater rate of viral load reduction in NPA of treated patients than that of nontreated patients was observed (?0.638 [95% CI, ?0.809 to ?0.466] vs ?0.409 [95% CI, ?0.663 to ?0.185] log10 copies/mL/d post-symptom onset), and the viral load was undetectable at day 6 after oseltamivir initiation, which was 1 day earlier than that of those whose treatment was initiated &gt; 2 days of symptom onset.\n\n The viral load was inversely correlated with concomitant absolute lymphocyte count in nontreated patients (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = ?0.687, P = .\n\n001) and treated patients (Pearson r = ?0.365, P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n Resolution of fever was 1.4 days later in nontreated than treated patients (P = .\n\n012)\nConclusions\nThe natural viral load profile was described.\n\n Oral oseltamivir suppresses viral load more effectively when given early in mild cases of pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infections.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094292","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Iris

transplantation.\n This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the incidence and predictors of post-transplant DNA virus infections (CMV, EBV, BKV and JCV infections) in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) at a single tertiary centre and evaluate their impact on graft outcomes.\n Methods: KTR transplanted between 2000 and 2021 were evaluated.\n Multivariate logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to identify factors associated with DNA virus infections and their impact on allograft outcomes respectively.\n A sub-analysis of individual viral infections was also conducted to describe the pattern, timing, interventions, and outcomes of individual infections.\n Results: Data from 962 recipients were evaluated (Mean age 47.3 ± 15 years, 62% male, 81% white).\n 30% of recipients (288/962) had infection(s) by one or more of the DNA viruses.\n Individually, CMV, EBV, BKV and JCV viruses were diagnosed in 13.8%.\n 11.3%, 8.9% and 4.4% of recipients respectively.\n Factors associated with increased risk of post-transplant DNA virus infection included recipient female gender, higher number of HLA mismatch, lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), CMV seropositive donor, maintenance with cyclosporin (rather than tacrolimus) and higher number of maintenance immunosuppressive medications.\n The slope of eGFR decline was steeper in recipients with a history of DNA virus infection irrespective of the virus type.\n Further, GFR declined faster with an increasing number of different viral infections.\n Death-censored graft loss adjusted for age, gender, total HLA mismatch, baseline eGFR and acute rejection was significantly higher in recipients with a history of DNA virus infection than those without infection (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR, 1.74, 95% CI, 1.08–2.80)).\n In contrast, dialysis-free survival did not differ between the two groups of recipients (aHR, 1.13, 95% CI, 0.88–1.47).\n Conclusion: Post-transplant DNA viral infection is associated with a higher risk of allograft loss.\n Careful management of immunosuppression and close surveillance of at-risk recipients may improve graft outcomes.\n","id":"PMC9695979","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kairi","surname":"Pullerits","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shona","surname":"Garland","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Shona","surname":"Garland","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sharmilee","surname":"Rengarajan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Malcolm","surname":"Guiver","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rajkumar","surname":"Chinnadurai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rachel

the medical records of 582 patients who underwent kidney transplant (KT) between 2001 and 2014. We divided the patients into a BKVAN group (15 patients) diagnosed by allograft biopsy and a control group (356 patients).\n\n\nResults\nThe incidence of BKVAN was 4.0%, and the mean follow-up duration was 93.1 ± 52.3 months.\n\n Median time from KT to BKVAN diagnosis was 5.9 months (interquartile range [IQR], 4.4–8.7).\n\n In the BKVAN group, 9 (60.0%) KTRs with combined acute rejection progressed to graft failure, and the median time from BKVAN diagnosis to graft failure was 36.2 months (IQR, 9.7–65.5).\n\n Death-censored graft survival rate and patient survival rate in the BKVAN

B19 virus infection.\n\n However, the epidemiology of parvovirus B19 and parvovirus B19-related anemia after KTx remains unclear.\n\n We conducted this systematic review (1) to investigate the incidence of parvovirus B19 infection after KTx and (2) to assess the incidence of parvovirus B19 among KTx patients with anemia.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nA systematic review was conducted in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases from inception to March 2019 to identify studies that reported the incidence rate of parvovirus B19 infection and/or seroprevalence of parvovirus B19 in KTx recipients.\n\n Effect estimates from the individual studies were extracted and combined using random-effects, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.\n\n The protocol for this systematic review is registered with PROSPERO (no.\n\n CRD42019125716).\n\n\nResults:\nNineteen observational studies with a total of 2108 KTx patients were enrolled.\n\n Overall, the pooled estimated seroprevalence of parvovirus B19 immunoglobulin G was 62.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 45.8%–76.1%).\n\n The pooled estimated incidence rate of positive parvovirus B19 DNA in the 1st year after KTx was 10.3% (95% CI: 5.5%–18.4%).\n\n After sensitivity analysis excluded a study that solely included KTx patients with anemia, the pooled estimated incidence rate of positive parvovirus B19 DNA after KTx was 7.6% (95% CI: 3.7%–15.0%).\n\n Among KTx with anemia, the pooled estimated incidence rate of positive parvovirus B19 DNA was 27.4% (95% CI: 16.6%–41.7%).\n\n Meta-regression analysis demonstrated no significant correlations between the year of study and the incidence rate of positive parvovirus B19 DNA (P = 0.33).\n\n Egger's regression asymmetry test was performed and demonstrated no publication bias in all analyses.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe overall estimated incidence of positive parvovirus B19 DNA after KTX is 10.3%.\n\n Among KTx with anemia, the incidence rate of positive parvovirus B19 DNA is 27.4%.\n\n The incidence of positive parvovirus B19 DNA does not seem to decrease

binders","abstract":"Background\nThe generation of interferon-gamma (IFN-?) by MHC class II activated CD4+ T helper cells play a substantial contribution in the control of infections such as caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\n In the past, numerous methods have been developed for predicting MHC class II binders that can activate T-helper cells.\n\n Best of author’s knowledge, no method has been developed so far that can predict the type of cytokine will be secreted by these MHC Class II binders or T-helper epitopes.\n\n In this study, an attempt has been made to predict the IFN-? inducing peptides.\n\n The main dataset used in this study contains 3705 IFN-? inducing and 6728 non-IFN-? inducing MHC class II binders.\n\n Another dataset called IFNgOnly contains 4483 IFN-? inducing epitopes and 2160 epitopes that induce other cytokine except IFN-?.\n\n In addition we have alternate dataset that contains IFN-? inducing and equal number of random peptides.\n\n\nResults\nIt was observed that the peptide length, positional conservation of residues and amino acid composition affects IFN-? inducing capabilities of these peptides.\n\n We identified the motifs in IFN-? inducing binders/peptides using MERCI software.\n\n Our analysis indicates that IFN-? inducing and non-inducing peptides can be discriminated using above features.\n\n We developed models for predicting IFN-? inducing peptides using various approaches like machine learning technique, motifs-based search, and hybrid approach.\n\n Our best model based on the hybrid approach achieved maximum prediction accuracy of 82.10% with MCC of 0.62 on main dataset.\n\n We also developed hybrid model on IFNgOnly dataset and achieved maximum accuracy of 81.39% with 0.57 MCC.\n\n\nConclusion\nBased on this study, we have developed a webserver for predicting i) IFN-? inducing peptides, ii) virtual screening of peptide libraries and iii) identification of IFN-? inducing regions in antigen (http://crdd.\n\nosdd.\n\nnet/raghava/ifnepitope/).\n\n\nReviewers\nThis article was reviewed by Prof Kurt Blaser, Prof Laurence Eisenlohr and Dr Manabu

Human Parvovirus B19 Infection in Kidney Transplantation","abstract":"Background\nDonor-derived human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infections are rarely reported.\n\n Thus, its incidence in kidney transplantation is still unknown due to lack of surveillance studies.\n\n Similarly, whether the donor needs to be routinely screened for B19V and whether the kidneys from those with B19V DNAemia could be accepted also remain unknown.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective study aims to evaluate the donor-derived B19V infections occurring in 823 living and 1,225 deceased donor kidney transplantations from January 2016 to December 2020. The serum viral load of living donors and their corresponding recipients was evaluated before and after transplantation.\n\n Meanwhile, for the deceased donor kidney transplantation, the serum viral load of recipients was only tested after transplantation; if recipients of a deceased donor subsequently developed B19V infection, the serum viral load of recipients and their corresponding donors before transplantation would then be further traced.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 15 living donors were B19V DNAemia positive before the donation, of which B19V DNAemia occurred in three corresponding recipients.\n\n In deceased donor kidney transplantation, DNAemia occurred simultaneously in 18 recipients and their corresponding nine donors.\n\n A progressive decline in hemoglobin and reticulocyte count could be observed in one living donor recipient and other 11 deceased donor recipients, which were all well controlled by treatment eventually.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe incidence of donor-derived B19V infection was 0.4% and 1.5% in living and deceased kidney transplantations, respectively.\n\n B19V was seemingly unnecessary to be routinely screened for the donor.\n\n Moreover, kidneys of the donors with B19V infection were acceptable.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8554309","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yedong","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chunchun","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junhao","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoliang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rending","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongfeng","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianyong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianghua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wenhan","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/ctr.13535","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The

Rejection Following CMV Prophylaxis in High-Risk Kidney Transplantation: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","abstract":"Many antiviral agents have been studied in clinical trials for allograft rejection prevention following cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis in high-risk kidney transplant patients.\n However, data on the most effective and safest treatment are lacking.\n We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to rank CMV prophylaxis agents for allograft rejection prevention following CMV prophylaxis in high-risk kidney transplant patients according to their efficacy and safety.\n We conducted searches on the MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, and CENTRAL databases, as well as the reference lists of selected studies up to December 2021, for published and peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of CMV prophylaxis agents in high-risk kidney transplant patients.\n Thirteen studies were independently selected by three reviewers and included post-kidney transplant patients indicated for CMV prophylaxis who had been randomized to receive prophylactic antiviral agents or standard of care.\n The reviewers independently extracted data from the included studies, and direct and network meta-analyses were applied to assess the study outcomes.\n The probability of efficacy and safety was evaluated, and the drugs were assigned a numerical ranking.\n We evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool.\n The primary outcome was an incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection, whereas the secondary outcome was a composite of major adverse drug reactions.\n Each outcome referred to the definition provided in the original studies.\n Valganciclovir, valacyclovir, and ganciclovir were identified to significantly decrease the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection with pooled risk differences (RDs) of ?20.53% (95% confidence interval [CI] = ?36.09% to ?4.98%), ?19.3% (95% CI = ?32.7% to ?5.93%), and ?10.4% (95% CI = ?19.7% to ?0.12%), respectively.\n The overall major adverse drug reaction was 5.7% without a significant difference when compared with placebo.\n Valganciclovir had the best combined efficacy and safety among the examined antiviral agents and was the most effective and safest antiviral agent overall for allograft rejection prevention following CMV prophylaxis.\n Valacyclovir was the optimal alternative antiviral agent for patients who were unable to tolerate intravenous ganciclovir or access oral valganciclovir as financial problem.\n However, compliance and dose-related toxicities should be closely monitored.\n","id":"PMC9010655","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Narisa","surname":"Ruenroengbun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tunlanut","surname":"Sapankaew","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kamolpat","surname":"Chaiyakittisopon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pakpoom","surname":"Phoompoung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thundon","surname":"Ngamprasertchai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/modpathol.3800033","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Acute

principle of balancing the immune system remains the mainstay of therapeutic strategy.\n While patient outcomes can be improved through screening, risk factors identification, and rapid reduction of immunosuppressants, a lack of standard curative therapy is the primary concern during clinical practice.\n Additionally, difficulty in pathological differential diagnosis and clinicopathology’s

clinical impact of updates of C4d?negative antibody?mediated rejection (ABMR) from the 2013 meeting, reports from active Banff Working Groups, the relationships of donor?specific antibody tests (anti?HLA and non?HLA) with transplant histopathology, and questions of molecular transplant diagnostics.\n The use of transcriptome gene sets, their resultant diagnostic classifiers, or common key genes to supplement the diagnosis and classification of rejection requires further consensus agreement and validation in biopsies.\n Newly introduced concepts include the i?IFTA score, comprising inflammation within areas of fibrosis and atrophy and acceptance of transplant arteriolopathy within the descriptions of chronic active T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR) or chronic ABMR.\n The pattern of mixed TCMR and ABMR was increasingly recognized.\n This report also includes improved definitions of TCMR and ABMR in pancreas transplants with specification of vascular lesions and prospects for defining a vascularized composite allograft rejection classification.\n The goal of the Banff process is ongoing integration of advances in histologic, serologic, and molecular diagnostic techniques to produce a consensus?based reporting system that offers precise composite scores, accurate routine diagnostics, and applicability to next?generation clinical

protocol of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and assessed the pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods.\n\n\nFindings\nFever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days.\n\n In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites.\n\n Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission.\n\n Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001).\n\n SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14.

and mortality.\n The disease has been shown to be associated with a new coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n The clinical and epidemiological aspects of SARS have been described.\n Moreover, the viral genome of SARS?CoV has been fully sequenced.\n However, much of the biological behaviour of the virus is not known and data on the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS?CoV are limited.\n In this study, six fatal cases of SARS were investigated for the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS?CoV using an in?situ hybridization (ISH) technique.\n Among all the tissues studied, positive signals were seen in pneumocytes in the lungs and surface enterocytes in the small bowel.\n Infected pneumocytes were further confirmed by immunofluorescence–fluorescence in?situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.\n These results provide important information concerning the tissue tropism of SARS?CoV, which is distinct from previously identified human coronaviruses, and suggest the possible involvement of novel receptors in this infection.\n Whereas the lung pathology was dominated by diffuse alveolar damage, the gut was relatively intact.\n These findings indicated that tissue responses to SARS?CoV infection are distinct in different organs.\n Copyright © 2004 John Wiley &amp; Sons,

continuing epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\n We assessed the epidemiology of SARS in Hong Kong.\n\n\nMethods\nWe included 1425 cases reported up to April 28, 2003. An integrated database was constructed from several sources containing information on epidemiological, demographic, and clinical variables.\n\n We estimated the key epidemiological distributions: infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death, and admission to discharge.\n\n We measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patients’age and the time from onset to admission.\n\n\nFindings\nAfter the initial phase of exponential growth, the rate of confirmed cases fell to less than 20 per day by April 28. Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts.\n\n The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6.4 days (95% Cl 5.2–7.7).\n\n The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic.\n\n The estimated case fatality rate was 13.2% (9.8–16.8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43.3% (35.2–52.4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric ? distribution.\n\n A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6.8% (4.0–9.6) and 55.0% (45.3–64.7), respectively.\n\n Case clusters have played an important part in the course of the epidemic.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients’age was strongly associated with outcome.\n\n The time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital did not alter outcome, but shorter intervals will be important to the wider population by restricting the infectious period before patients are placed in quarantine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112380","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Christl

In addition, pulmonary lesions were similar at day 4 post inoculation.\n However, at day 7 post inoculation, NL/2631-R223 caused milder pulmonary lesions and degree of alveolitis than NL/602. This indicated that the mutant virus was less pathogenic.\n Both NL/2631-R223 and a recombinant virus with a single I223R change (recNL/602-I223R), transmitted among ferrets by aerosols, despite observed attenuation of recNL/602-I223R in vitro.\n In conclusion, the I223R mutated virus isolate has comparable replicative ability and transmissibility, but lower pathogenicity than the reference virus based on these in vivo studies.\n This implies that the 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus subtype with an isoleucine to arginine change at position 223 in the neuraminidase has the potential to spread in the human population.\n It is important to be vigilant for this mutation in influenza surveillance and to continue efforts to increase the arsenal of antiviral drugs to combat influenza.\n","id":"PMC3182921","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Erhard","surname":"van der Vries","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edwin J.","surname":"Veldhuis Kroeze","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Koert J.","surname":"Stittelaar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martin","surname":"Linster","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anne","surname":"Van der Linden","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eefje J.

provide an overview of the current knowledge gathered on this interplay between influenza viruses and the cellular spliceosome, with a particular focus on influenza A viruses (IAV).\n These viruses have developed accurate regulation mechanisms to reassign the host spliceosome to alter host cellular expression and enable an optimal expression of specific spliced viral products throughout infection.\n Moreover, IAV segments undergoing splicing display high levels of similarity with human consensus splice sites and their viral transcripts show noteworthy secondary structures.\n Sequence alignments and consensus analyses, along with recently published studies, suggest both conservation and evolution of viral splice site sequences and structure for improved adaptation to the host.\n Altogether, these results emphasize the ability of IAV to be well adapted to the host’s splicing machinery, and further investigations may contribute to a better understanding of splicing regulation with regard to viral replication, host range, and pathogenesis.\n","id":"PMC4030477","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Julia","surname":"Dubois","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olivier","surname":"Terrier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Manuel","surname":"Rosa-Calatrava","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/nm1201-1306","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

Descriptive analyses of all studies were performed, and when more than 4 studies were available, a random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing as a reference.\n\n To evaluate factors influencing test sensitivity, we performed 3 different analyses using multivariable mixed-effects meta-regression models.\n\n We included 194 studies with 221,878 Ag-RDTs performed.\n\n Overall, the pooled estimates of Ag-RDT sensitivity and specificity were 72.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 69.8 to 74.2) and 98.9% (95% CI 98.6 to 99.1).\n\n When manufacturer instructions were followed, sensitivity increased to 76.3% (95% CI 73.7 to 78.7).\n\n Sensitivity was markedly better on samples with lower RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values (97.9% [95% CI 96.9 to 98.9] and 90.6% [95% CI 88.3 to 93.0] for Ct-values &lt;20 and &lt;25, compared to 54.4% [95% CI 47.3 to 61.5] and 18.7% [95% CI 13.9 to 23.4] for Ct-values ?25 and ?30) and was estimated to increase by 2.9 percentage points (95% CI 1.7 to 4.0) for every unit decrease in mean Ct-value when adjusting for testing procedure and patients’ symptom status.\n\n Concordantly, we found the mean Ct-value to be lower for true positive (22.2 [95% CI 21.5 to 22.8]) compared to false negative (30.4 [95% CI 29.7 to 31.1]) results.\n\n Testing in the first week from symptom onset resulted in substantially higher sensitivity (81.9% [95% CI 77.7 to 85.5]) compared to testing after 1 week (51.8%, 95% CI 41.5 to 61.9).\n\n Similarly, sensitivity was higher in symptomatic (76.2% [95% CI 73.3 to 78.9]) compared to asymptomatic (56.8% [95% CI 50.9 to 62.4]) persons.\n\n However, both effects were mainly driven by the Ct-value of the sample.\n\n With regards to sample type, highest sensitivity was found for nasopharyngeal (NP) and combined NP/oropharyngeal samples (70.8% [95% CI 68.3 to 73.2]), as well as in anterior nasal/mid-turbinate samples (77.3% [95% CI 73.0 to 81.0]).\n\n Our analysis was limited by the included studies’ heterogeneity in viral load assessment and sample origination.\n\n\nConclusions\nAg-RDTs detect most of the individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and almost all (&gt;90%) when high viral loads are present.\n\n With viral load, as estimated by Ct-value, being the most influential factor on their sensitivity, they are especially useful to detect persons with high viral load who are most likely to transmit the virus.\n\n To further quantify the effects of other factors influencing test sensitivity, standardization of clinical accuracy studies and access to patient level Ct-values and duration of symptoms are needed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9187092","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lukas

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it is necessary to perform early identification and isolation of people shedding the infectious virus in biological materials with high viral loads several days prior to symptom onset.\n\n Rapid antigen tests for infectious diseases are useful to prevent the pandemic spread in clinical settings.\n\n\nMethods\nWe evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 antigen test, Espline® SARS-CoV-2 reagent, with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as reference test, using 129 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from COVID-19 hospitalized patients or from patients suspected having COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n Out of these, 63 RT-PCR positive and 66 RT-PCR negative specimens were identified.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 63 RT-PCR positive specimens, 25 were positive in the Espline test.\n\n Test sensitivity was estimated based on the 532.4 copies/reaction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA obtained through receiver operating characteristic

and implement infection control measures.\n\n Although real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current recommended laboratory method, several rapid antigen point-of-care tests (POCTs) were developed as frontline testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.\n\n\nObjectives\nThe aim of this study was to assess a recently CE-approved POCT, SARS-CoV-2 Ag Test on the LumiraDx™ Platform (LumiraDx GmbH, Cologne, Germany) for the identification of SARS-COV-2 infected subjects at hospital setting.\n\n\nMethods\nLumiraDx POCT was implemented in three hospital settings: adult and pediatric emergency departments and occupational medicine department along two-month period during the second peak of Italian SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.\n\n Rapid antigen testing was performed on direct nasal swabs and results were compared with those obtained by Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay.\n\n\nResults\nOverall sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV were 90.3%, 92.1%, 95.1%,

study","abstract":"Background\nReal-time PCR is recommended to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n However, PCR availability is restricted in most countries.\n\n Rapid diagnostic tests are considered acceptable alternatives, but data are lacking on their performance.\n\n We assessed the performance of four antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests and one antigen-based rapid diagnostic test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community in Cameroon.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this clinical, prospective, diagnostic accuracy study, we enrolled individuals aged at least 21 years who were either symptomatic and suspected of having COVID-19 or asymptomatic and presented for screening.\n\n We tested peripheral blood for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Innovita (Biological Technology; Beijing, China), Wondfo (Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech; Guangzhou, China), SD Biosensor (SD Biosensor; Gyeonggi-do, South Korea), and Runkun tests (Runkun Pharmaceutical; Hunan, China), and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 antigen using the SD Biosensor test.\n\n Antigen rapid diagnostic tests were compared with Abbott PCR testing (Abbott; Abbott Park, IL, USA), and antibody rapid diagnostic tests were compared with Biomerieux immunoassays (Biomerieux; Marcy l'Etoile, France).\n\n We retrospectively tested two diagnostic algorithms that incorporated rapid diagnostic tests for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using simulation modelling.\n\n\nFindings\n1195 participants were enrolled in the study.\n\n 347 (29%) tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive, 223 (19%) rapid diagnostic test antigen-positive, and 478 (40%) rapid diagnostic test antibody-positive.\n\n Antigen-based rapid diagnostic test sensitivity was 80·0% (95% CI 71·0–88·0) in the first 7 days after symptom onset, but antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests had only 26·8% sensitivity (18·3–36·8).\n\n Antibody rapid diagnostic test sensitivity increased to 76·4% (70·1–82·0) 14 days after symptom onset.\n\n Among asymptomatic participants, the sensitivity of antigen-based and antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests were 37·0% (27·0–48·0) and 50·7% (42·2–59·1), respectively.\n\n Cohen's ? showed substantial agreement between Wondfo antibody rapid diagnostic test and gold-standard ELISA (?=0·76; sensitivity 0·98) and between Biosensor and ELISA (?=0·60; sensitivity 0·94).\n\n Innovita (?=0·47; sensitivity 0·93) and Runkun (?=0·43; sensitivity 0·76) showed moderate agreement.\n\n An antigen-based retrospective algorithm applied to symptomatic patients showed 94·0% sensitivity and 91·0% specificity in the first 7 days after symptom onset.\n\n For asymptomatic participants, the algorithm showed a sensitivity of 34% (95% CI 23·0–44·0) and a specificity of 92·0% (88·0–96·0).\n\n\nInterpretation\nRapid diagnostic tests had good overall sensitivity for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Rapid diagnostic tests could be incorporated into efficient testing algorithms as an alternative to PCR to decrease diagnostic delays and onward viral transmission.\n\n\nFunding\nMédecins Sans Frontières WACA and Médecins Sans Frontières OCG.\n\n\nTranslations\nFor the French and Spanish translations of

the emergency department","abstract":"Background\nIn the emergency department (ED) setting, rapid testing for SARS-CoV-2 is likely associated with advantages to patients and healthcare workers, for example, enabling early but rationale use of limited isolation resources.\n\n Most recently, several SARS-CoV-2 rapid point-of-care antigen tests (AGTEST) became available.\n\n There is a growing need for data regarding their clinical utility and performance in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the real life setting EDs.\n\n\nMethods\nWe implemented AGTEST (here: Roche/SD Biosensor) in all four adult and the one paediatric EDs at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin in our diagnostic testing strategy.\n\n Test indication was limited to symptomatic suspected COVID-19 patients.\n\n Detailed written instructions on who to test were distributed and testing personnel were trained in proper specimen collection and handling.\n\n In each suspected COVID-19 patient, two sequential deep oro-nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained for viral tests.\n\n The first swab was collected for nucleic acid testing through SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase (rt)-PCR diagnostic panel (PCRTEST) in the central laboratory.\n\n The second swab was collected to perform the AGTEST.\n\n Analysis of routine data was prospectively planned and data were retrieved from the medical records after the inclusion period in the adult or paediatric ED.\n\n Diagnostic performance was calculated using the PCRTEST as reference standard.\n\n False negative and false positive AGTEST results were analysed individually and compared with viral concentrations derived from the calibrated PCRTEST.\n\n\nResults\nWe included n?=?483 patients including n?=?202 from the paediatric ED.\n\n N?=?10 patients had to be excluded due to missing data and finally n?=?473 patients were analysed.\n\n In the adult cohort, the sensitivity of the AGTEST was 75.3 (95%CI: 65.8/83.4)% and the specificity was 100 (95%CI: 98.4/100)% with a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 32.8%; the positive predictive value was 100 (95%CI: 95.7/100)% and the negative predictive value 89.2 (95%CI: 84.5/93.9)%.\n\n In the paediatric cohort, the sensitivity was 72.0 (95%CI: 53.3/86.7)%, the specificity was 99.4 (95%CI:97.3/99.9)% with a prevalence of 12.4%; the positive predictive value was 94.7 (95%CI: 78.3/99.7)% and the negative predictive value was 96.2 (95%CI:92.7/98.3)%.\n\n Thus, n?=?22 adult and n?=?7 paediatric patients showed false negative AGTEST results and only one false positive AGTEST occurred, in the paediatric cohort.\n\n Calculated viral concentrations from the rt-PCR lay between 3.16 and 9.51 log10 RNA copies/mL buffer.\n\n All false negative patients in the adult ED cohort, who had confirmed symptom onset at least seven days earlier had less than 5?×?105 RNA copies/mL buffer.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe conclude that the use of AGTEST among symptomatic patients in the emergency setting is useful for the early identification of COVID-19, but patients who test negative require confirmation by PCRTEST and must stay isolated until this result becomes available.\n\n Adult patients with a false negative AGTEST and symptom onset at least one week earlier have typically a low SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and are likely no longer infectious.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7898296","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Martin","surname":"Möckel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Victor

to identify and isolate people with asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.\n\n Reagent shortages and restricted access to high throughput testing solutions have limited the effectiveness of conventional assays such as quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), particularly throughout the first months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\n\n We investigated the use of LamPORE, where loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is coupled to nanopore sequencing technology, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations.\n\n\nMethods\nIn an asymptomatic prospective cohort, for 3 weeks in September 2020, health-care workers across four sites (Birmingham, Southampton, Basingstoke and Manchester) self-swabbed with nasopharyngeal swabs weekly and supplied a saliva specimen daily.\n\n These samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the Oxford Nanopore LamPORE system and a reference RT-qPCR assay on extracted sample RNA.\n\n A second retrospective cohort of 848 patients with influenza-like illness from March 2020 to June 2020 were similarly tested from nasopharyngeal swabs.\n\n\nResults\nIn the asymptomatic cohort a total of 1200 participants supplied 23 427 samples (3966 swab, 19 461 saliva) over a 3-week period.\n\n The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 detection using LamPORE was 0.95%.\n\n Diagnostic sensitivity and

four commercially available tests in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe analyzed in parallel nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs from 154 consecutive patients admitted to our department with moderate to severe COVID-19, using quantitative RT-PCR (Cobas, Roche) and up to four antigen tests from different distributors.\n\n Antigen test results were linked to Ct (cycle threshold) values

immunoglobulin G (IgG) serological RDTs.\n Plasma and nasopharyngeal samples were collected between 14 March and 11 April 2020 at hospital admission from 45 patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT?PCR) confirmed COVID?19 and 20 negative controls.\n SARS?CoV?2 antigen (Ag) was assessed in nasopharyngeal swabs using the Coris Respi?Strip.\n For IgM/IgG detection, SureScreen Diagnostics and Szybio Biotech RDTs were used in addition to laboratory assays (Abbott Alinity i SARS?CoV?2 IgG and Theradiag COVID?19 IgM enzyme?linked immunosorbent assay).\n Using the Ag RDT, 13 out of 45 (29.0%) specimens tested positive, the sensitivity was 87.0% for cycle threshold (C\nt) values ?25% and 0% for C\nt values greater than 25. IgG detection was associated with high C\nt values and the amount of time after the onset of symptoms.\n The profile of isolated IgM on RDTs was more frequently observed during the first and second week after the onset of symptoms.\n The combination of Ag and IgM/IgG RDTs enabled the detection of up to 84.0% of COVID?19 confirmed cases at hospital admission.\n Antigen and antibody?based RDTs showed suboptimal performances when used alone.\n However when used in combination, they are able to identify most COVID?19 patients admitted in an emergency

implement appropriate infection control precautions and rapidly assign patients to care pathways.\n\n Rapid testing methods, such as SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen testing (RAT) may improve patient care, despite a lower sensitivity than real-time PCR (RT-PCR) testing.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients presenting to an Emergency Department (ED) in Melbourne, Australia, were risk-stratified for their likelihood of active COVID-19 infection, and a non-randomised cohort of patients were tested by both Abbott Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag test (RAT) and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR.\n\n Patients with a positive RAT in the ‘At or High Risk’ COVID-19 group were moved immediately to a COVID-19 ward rather than waiting for a RT-PCR result.\n\n Clinical and laboratory data were assessed to determine test performance characteristics; and length of stay in the ED was compared for the different patient cohorts.\n\n\nFindings\nAnalysis of 1762 paired RAT/RT-PCR samples demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 75.5% (206/273; 95% CI: 69·9-80·4) for the Abbott Panbio™ COVID-12 Ag test, with specificity of 100% (1489/1489; 95% CI: 99·8-100).\n\n Sensitivity improved with increasing risk for COVID-19 infection, from 72·4% (95% CI: 52·8-87·3) in the ‘No Risk’ cohort to 100% (95% CI: 29·2-100) in the ‘High Risk’ group.\n\n Time in the ED for the ‘At/High Risk’ group decreased from 421 minutes (IQR: 281, 525) for those with a positive RAT result to 274 minutes (IQR:140, 425) for those with a negative RAT result, p = 0.02.\nInterpretation\nThe positive predictive value of a positive RAT in this setting was high, allowing more rapid instigation of COVID-19 care pathways and an improvement in patient flow within the ED.\n\n\nFunding\nRoyal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne,

Siemens).\n\n\nMethods\n100 RT-PCR negative and 84 RT-PCR positive oropharyngeal swabs were prospectively collected and used to determine performance and accuracy of these AgPOCTs.\n\n Handling was evaluated by 10 healthcare workers/users through a questionnaire.\n\n\nResults\nThe median duration from symptom onset to sampling was 6 days (IQR 2–12 days).\n\n The overall respective sensitivity were 49.4 % (CI95 %: 38.9–59.9), 44.6 % (CI95 %: 34.3–55.3), 45.8 % (CI95 %: 35.5–56.5) and 54.9 % (CI95 %: 43.4?65.9) for tests I, II, III and IV, respectively.\n\n In the high viral load subgroup (containing &gt;106 copies of SARS-CoV-2 /swab, n = 26), AgPOCTs reached sensitivities of 92.3 % or more (range 92.3 %–100 %).\n\n Specificity was 100 % for tests I, II (CI95 %: 96.3–100 for both

We designed a prospective diagnostic evaluation comparing self-taken and healthcare worker (HCW)-taken throat/nasal swabs to perform RDTs for SARS-CoV-2, and how these compare to

cases.\n\n The sudden surge in the number of cases is overwhelming the capacity of the national healthcare system, particularly in developing countries.\n\n Central to the containment of the ongoing pandemic is the availability of rapid and accurate diagnostic tests that could pinpoint patients at early disease stages.\n\n In the current study, we aimed to (1) Evaluate the diagnostic performance of the rapid antigen test (RAT) “Standard™ Q COVID-19 Ag” against reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) in eighty-three swabs collected from COVID-19 suspected individuals showing various demographic features, clinical and radiological findings.\n\n (2) Test whether measuring laboratory parameters in participant’s blood would enhance the predictive accuracy of RAT.\n\n (3) Identify the most important features that determine the results of both RAT and RT-qPCR.\n\n\nMethods\nDiagnostic measurements (e.\n\ng.\n\n sensitivity, specificity, etc.\n\n) and receiver operating

the diagnostic performance of the NPS and the NMTS for the Panbio™ COVID-19 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT).\n Two hundred and forty-three individuals were swabbed three times by healthcare professionals: a NMTS and a NPS specimen for the Ag-RDT and an oropharyngeal swab for real time RT-PCR.\n Forty-nine participants were RNA-SARS-CoV-2 positive by real time RT-PCR: 45 and 40 were positive by the Ag-RDT with NPS and NMTS, respectively.\n The overall sensitivity and specificity were 91.8% (95% CI: 83.2–100.0) and 99.5% (95% CI: 98.2–100.0) for Ag-RDT with NPS, and 81.6% (95% CI: 69.8–93.5) and 100.0% (95% CI: 99.7–100.0) for the Ag-RDT with NMTS.\n The Cohen’s kappa index was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.85–0.98).\n Among asymptomatic individuals, the Ag-RDT with both sampling techniques showed a high sensitivity [100.0% (95% CI: 95.5–100.0) with NPS; 90.9% (95% CI: 69.4–100.0) with NMTS], while the performance of the test decreased in samples with Ct? 30 and in patients tested after the first 7 days from symptom onset.\n Although the NMTS yielded a lower sensitivity compared to NPS, it might be considered a reliable alternative, as it presents greater adherence among patients, enabling scaling of antigen testing strategies, particularly in countries with under-resourced health systems.\n","id":"PMC8986327","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paola","surname":"Sicilia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gonzalo","surname":"Castro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anabella

(COVID-19) is currently finally determined in laboratory settings by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (rt-PCR).\n\n However, simple testing with immediately available results are crucial to gain control over COVID-19. The aim was to evaluate such a point-of-care antigen rapid test (AG-rt) device in its performance compared to laboratory-based rt-PCR testing in COVID-19 suspected, symptomatic patients.\n\n\nMethods\nFor this prospective study, two specimens each of 541 symptomatic female (54.7%) and male (45.3%) patients aged between 18 and 95 years tested at five emergency departments (ED, n = 296) and four primary healthcare centres (PHC, n = 245), were compared, using AG-rt (positive/negative/invalid) and rt-PCR (positive/negative and cycle threshold, Ct) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratios (LR+/-) of the AG-rt were assessed.\n\n\nResults\nDifferences between ED and PHC were detected regarding gender, age, symptoms, disease prevalence, and diagnostic performance.\n\n Overall, 174 (32.2%) were tested positive on AG-rt and 213 (39.4%) on rt-PCR.\n\n AG correctly classified 91.7% of all rt-PCR positive cases with a sensitivity of 80.3%, specificity of 99.1%, PPV of 98.3, NPV of 88.6%, LR(+) of 87.8, and LR(-) of 0.20. The highest sensitivities and specificities of AG-rt were detected in PHC (sensitivity: 84.4%, specificity: 100.0%), when using Ct of 30 as cut-off (sensitivity: 92.5%, specificity: 97.8%), and when symptom onset was within the first three days (sensitivity: 82.9%, specificity: 99.6%).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe highest sensitivity was detected with a high viral load.\n\n Our findings suggest that AG-rt are comparable to rt-PCR to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 suspected symptomatic patients presenting both at emergency departments and primary health care

testing at three public health service test sites.\n\n Participants underwent molecular test sampling and received two self-tests (the Hangzhou AllTest Biotech saliva self-test and the SD Biosensor nasal self-test by Roche Diagnostics) to perform themselves at home.\n\n Diagnostic accuracy of both self-tests was assessed with molecular testing as reference.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Out of 2819 participants, 6.5% had a positive molecular test.\n\n Overall sensitivities were 46.7% (39.3–54.2%) for the saliva Ag-RDT and 68.9% (61.6–75.6%) for the nasal Ag-RDT.\n\n With a viral load cut-off (??5.2 log10 SARS-CoV-2 E-gene copies/mL) as a proxy of infectiousness, these sensitivities increased to 54.9% (46.4–63.3%) and 83.9% (76.9–89.5%), respectively.\n\n For the nasal Ag-RDT, sensitivities were 78.5% (71.1–84.8%) and 22.6% (9.6–41.1%) in those symptomatic and asymptomatic at the time of sampling, which increased to 90.4% (83.8–94.9%) and 38.9% (17.3–64.3%) after applying the viral load cut-off.\n\n In those with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, sensitivities were 36.8% (16.3–61.6%) and 72.7% (65.1–79.4%).\n\n Specificities were?&gt;?99% and?&gt;?99%, positive predictive values?&gt;?70% and?&gt;?90%, and negative predictive values?&gt;?95% and?&gt;?95%, for the saliva and nasal Ag-RDT, respectively, in most analyses.\n\n Most participants considered the self-performing and result interpretation (very) easy for both self-tests.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>The Hangzhou AllTest Biotech saliva self Ag-RDT is not reliable for SARS-CoV-2 detection, overall, and in all studied subgroups.\n\n The SD Biosensor nasal self Ag-RDT had high sensitivity in individuals with symptoms and in those without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection but low sensitivity in asymptomatic individuals and those with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection which warrants further investigation.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available

asymptomatic testing pilot: population based cohort study","abstract":"Objective\nTo assess the performance of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid lateral flow test (LFT) versus polymerase chain reaction testing in the asymptomatic general population attending testing centres.\n\n\nDesign\nObservational cohort study.\n\n\nSetting\nCommunity LFT pilot at covid-19 testing sites in Liverpool, UK.\n\n\nParticipants\n5869 asymptomatic adults (?18 years) voluntarily attending one of 48 testing sites during 6-29 November 2020.\nInterventions\nParticipants were tested using both an Innova LFT and a quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test based on supervised self-administered swabbing at testing sites.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nSensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of LFT compared with RT-qPCR in an epidemic steady state of covid-19 among adults with no classic symptoms of the disease.\n\n\nResults\nOf 5869 test results, 22 (0.4%) LFT results and 343 (5.8%) RT-qPCR results were void (that is, when the control line fails to appear within 30 minutes).\n\n Excluding the void results, the LFT versus RT-qPCR showed a sensitivity of 40.0% (95% confidence interval 28.5% to 52.4%; 28/70), specificity of 99.9% (99.8% to 99.99%; 5431/5434), positive predictive value of 90.3% (74.2% to 98.0%; 28/31), and negative predictive value of 99.2% (99.0% to 99.4%; 5431/5473).\n\n When the void samples were assumed to be negative, a sensitivity was observed for LFT of 37.8% (26.8% to 49.9%; 28/74), specificity of 99.6% (99.4% to 99.8%; 5431/5452), positive predictive value of 84.8% (68.1% to 94.9%; 28/33), and negative predictive value of 93.4% (92.7% to 94.0%; 5431/5814).\n\n The sensitivity in participants with an RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) of &lt;18.3 (approximate viral loads &gt;106 RNA copies/mL) was 90.9% (58.7% to 99.8%; 10/11), a Ct of &lt;24.4 (&gt;104 RNA copies/mL) was 69.4% (51.9% to 83.7%; 25/36), and a Ct of &gt;24.4 (&lt;104 RNA copies/mL) was 9.7% (1.9% to 23.7%; 3/34).\n\n LFT is likely to detect at least three fifths and at most 998 in every 1000 people with a positive RT-qPCR test result with high viral load.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe Innova LFT can be useful for identifying infections among adults who report no symptoms of covid-19, particularly those with high viral load who are more likely to infect others.\n\n The number of asymptomatic adults with lower Ct (indicating higher viral load) missed by LFT, although small, should be considered when using single LFT in high consequence settings.\n\n Clear and accurate communication with the public about how to interpret test results is important, given the chance of missing some cases, even at high viral loads.\n\n Further research is needed to understand how infectiousness is reflected in the viral antigen shedding detected by LFT versus the viral loads approximated by RT-qPCR.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8259455","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marta","surname":"García-Fiñana","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David

SARS CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction: A conundrum in surgical decision making","abstract":"Purpose:\nSince the eye is in close proximity to the oro-nasal cavity, transmission of SARS CoV-2 is higher during ophthalmic surgical procedures, it is vital to ensure the safety of the healthcare team by pre-operative Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) and real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS CoV-2 viral RNA of all patients planned for elective or emergency surgery.\n\n Hence, understanding the profile of pre-operative RAT and real-time RT-PCR among patients planned for various ophthalmic procedures, will help us make better decisions for future guidelines, for optimal planning of ophthalmic elective or emergency surgeries, keeping in mind the current scenario.\n\n\nMethods:\nThis is a prospective descriptive study conducted on patients planned for elective or emergency ophthalmic surgeries, who had no COVID-19-related symptoms pre-operatively and were subjected to preoperative RAT and real-time RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs for SARS CoV-2 viral RNA.\n\n Data was compiled and statistically analysed.\n\n\nResults:\n204 patients underwent pre-operative RAT and RT-PCR testing; of which, 85 were females and 119 were males.\n\n Mean age of the study population was 51.44 ± 16.501 years.\n\n Among the 204, 2 tested positive for SARS CoV-2 with Rapid Antigen testing as well as RT-PCR and 10 patients tested positive via RT-PCR after a negative RAT result of the same sample.\n\n\nConclusion:\nPre-operative testing for COVID-19 disease is indispensable as there is a high chance of transmission from patient to healthcare workers.\n\n RAT has the advantage of quick results and may play a role in case of emergency procedures.\n\n However, it is prudent to perform the more sensitive real-time RT-PCR before any elective, non-emergency procedures or surgeries to avoid any undue risk to the healthcare team.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8302313","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"K
