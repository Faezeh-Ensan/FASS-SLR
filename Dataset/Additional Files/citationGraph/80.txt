COVID?19 infection during pregnancy and childbirth, particularly concerning clinical presentation and outcomes.\n\n\nSearch strategy\nA systematic search of LitCovid, EBSCO MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus electronic databases.\n\n The references of relevant studies were also searched.\n\n\nSelection criteria\nIdentified titles and abstracts were screened to select original reports and cross?checked for overlap of cases.\n\n\nData collection and analysis\nA descriptive summary organized by aspects of clinical presentations (symptoms, imaging, and laboratory) and outcomes (maternal and perinatal).\n\n\nMain results\nWe identified 33 studies reporting 385 pregnant women with COVID?19 infection: 368 (95.6%) mild; 14 (3.6%) severe; and 3 (0.8%) critical.\n\n Seventeen women were admitted to intensive care, including six who were mechanically ventilated and one maternal mortality.\n\n A total of 252 women gave birth, comprising 175 (69.4%) cesarean and 77 (30.6%) vaginal births.\n\n Outcomes for 256 newborns included four RT?PCR positive neonates, two stillbirths, and one neonatal death.\n\n\nConclusion\nCOVID?19 infection during pregnancy probably has a clinical presentation and severity resembling that in non?pregnant adults.\n\n It is probably not associated with poor maternal or perinatal outcomes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9087748","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Farida","surname":"Elshafeey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rana","surname":"Magdi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nader","surname":"Hindi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohamed","surname":"Elshebiny","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nourhan","surname":"Farrag","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shahd","surname":"Mahdy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohamed","surname":"Sabbour","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sara","surname":"Gebril","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohamed","surname":"Nasser","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Menna","surname":"Kamel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abdelrahman","surname":"Amir","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Moataz","surname":"Maher

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnant patients","abstract":"Background\nDuring the early months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, risks associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pregnancy were uncertain.\n\n Pregnant patients can serve as a model for the success of clinical and public health responses during public health emergencies as they are typically in frequent contact with the medical system.\n\n Population-based estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pregnancy are unknown because of incomplete ascertainment of pregnancy status or inclusion of only single centers or hospitalized cases.\n\n Whether pregnant women were protected by the public health response or through their interactions with obstetrical providers in the early months of pandemic is not clearly understood.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aimed to estimate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnancy and to examine the disparities by race and ethnicity and English language proficiency in Washington State.\n\n\nStudy Design\nPregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction–confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection diagnosed between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 were identified within 35 hospitals and clinics, capturing 61% of annual deliveries in Washington State.\n\n Infection rates in pregnancy were estimated overall and by Washington State Accountable Community of Health region and cross-sectionally compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State.\n\n Race and ethnicity and language used for medical care of pregnant patients were compared with recent data from Washington State.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 240 pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections were identified during the study period with 70.7% from minority racial and ethnic groups.\n\n The principal findings in our study were as follows: (1) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate was 13.9 per 1000 deliveries in pregnant patients (95% confidence interval, 8.3–23.2) compared with 7.3 per 1000 (95% confidence interval, 7.2–7.4) in adults aged 20 to 39 years in Washington State (rate ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–2.3); (2) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate reduced to 11.3 per 1000 deliveries (95% confidence interval, 6.3–20.3) when excluding 45 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 detected through asymptomatic screening (rate ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.96–1.9); (3) the proportion of pregnant patients in non-White racial and ethnic groups with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 infection was 2- to 4-fold higher than the race and ethnicity distribution of women in Washington State who delivered live births in 2018; and (4) the proportion of pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection receiving medical care in a non-English language was higher than estimates of pregnant patients receiving care with limited English proficiency in Washington State (30.4% vs 7.6%).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnant people was 70% higher than similarly aged adults in Washington State, which could not be completely explained by universal screening at delivery.\n\n Pregnant patients from nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups and patients receiving medical care in a non-English language were overrepresented.\n\n Pregnant women were not protected from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in the early months of the pandemic.\n\n Moreover, the greatest burden of infections occurred in nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups.\n\n These data coupled with a broader recognition that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe illness and maternal mortality strongly suggested that pregnant people should be broadly prioritized for coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine allocation in the United States similar to some states.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7884918","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Erica

severity at delivery and trimester of infection are unknown.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aimed to describe disease severity and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pregnancy across the Washington State, including pregnancy complications and outcomes, hospitalization, and case fatality.\n\n\nStudy Design\nPregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction–confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, were identified in a multicenter retrospective cohort study from 35 sites in Washington State.\n\n Sites captured 61% of annual state deliveries.\n\n Case-fatality rates in pregnancy were compared with coronavirus disease 2019 fatality rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State using rate ratios and rate differences.\n\n Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared by trimester of infection and disease severity at the time of delivery.\n\n\nResults\nThe principal study findings were as follows: (1) among 240 pregnant patients in Washington State with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections, 1 in 11 developed severe or critical disease, 1 in 10 were hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019, and 1 in 80 died; (2) the coronavirus disease 2019–associated hospitalization rate was 3.5-fold higher than in similarly aged adults in Washington State (10.0% vs 2.8%; rate ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.3–5.3); (3) pregnant patients hospitalized for a respiratory concern were more likely to have a comorbidity or underlying

mortality rate of 1250 of 100,000 pregnancies (95% confidence interval, 257–3653); (5) the coronavirus disease 2019 case fatality in pregnancy was a significant 13.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.7–43.6) higher in pregnant patients than in similarly aged individuals in Washington State with an absolute difference in mortality rate of 1.2% (95% confidence interval, ?0.3 to 2.6); and (6) preterm birth was significantly higher among women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 at delivery than for women who had recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (45.4% severe or critical

significantly higher than in similarly aged adults in Washington State.\n\n These data indicate that pregnant patients are at risk of severe or critical disease and mortality compared to nonpregnant adults, and also at risk for preterm birth.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7838012","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Erica

with RA.\n\n\nMethods\nThis analysis includes 15?132 patients exposed to adalimumab in global RA clinical trials.\n\n AEs of interest included overall infections, laboratory abnormalities and AEs associated with influenza vaccination.\n\n Pregnancy outcome data were collected from the Adalimumab Pregnancy Registry.\n\n\nResults\nSerious infections and tuberculosis occurred at a rate of 4.7 and 0.3 events/100 patient-years, respectively.\n\n Two patients experienced hepatitis B reactivation.\n\n No significant laboratory abnormalities were reported with adalimumab-plus-methotrexate compared with placebo-plus-methotrexate.\n\n Influenza-related AEs occurred in 5% of vaccinated patients compared with 14% of patients not vaccinated during the study.\n\n Relative risk of major birth defects and spontaneous abortions in adalimumab-exposed women were similar between that of unexposed women with RA and healthy women.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis analysis confirms and expands the known safety profile of adalimumab and reports no additional safety risk of laboratory abnormalities, hepatitis B reactivation and pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortions and birth defects.\n\n The benefits of influenza vaccination are reinforced.\n\n\nTrial registration numbers\nNCT00195663, NCT00195702, NCT00448383, NCT00049751, NCT00234845, NCT00650390, NCT00235859, NCT00647920, NCT00649545,

limited.\n\n Consequently, anti?TNF agents are often discontinued early in gestation.\n\n Certolizumab pegol (CZP), a PEGylated, Fc?free anti?TNF agent approved for the treatment of rheumatic diseases and/or Crohn's disease, has minimal to no active placental transfer.\n\n This analysis was undertaken to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women receiving CZP, especially those exposed during early pregnancy.\n\n\nMethods\nProspective and retrospective data on maternal CZP exposure were extracted from the UCB Pharma safety database through March 6, 2017. Analysis was limited to prospective reports to avoid potential bias associated with retrospective submissions.\n\n The numbers of live births, miscarriages, elective abortions, stillbirths, and major congenital malformations were ascertained.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1,137 prospectively reported pregnancies with maternal exposure to CZP, 528 (including 10 twin pregnancies) had 538 known outcomes: 459 live births (85.3%), 47 miscarriages (8.7%), 27 elective abortions (5.0%), and 5 stillbirths (0.9%).\n\n There were 8 major congenital malformations (1.7%) among the 459 infants.\n\n First trimester exposure occurred in 367 (81.2%) of 452 pregnancies resulting in 459 live births.\n\n Exposure during all 3 trimesters occurred in 201 (44.5%) of 452 pregnancies.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis analysis represents the largest cohort of pregnant women exposed to an anti?TNF agent for management of chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\n Analysis of pregnancy outcomes does not indicate a teratogenic effect of CZP, compared to the general population, nor an increased risk of fetal death.\n\n The data are reassuring for women of childbearing age considering treatment with CZP.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6174965","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Megan E.

The most common clinical manifestations of covid-19 in pregnancy were fever and cough (both 36%).\n\n Compared with non-pregnant women of reproductive age, pregnant and recently pregnant women with covid-19 were less likely to report symptoms of fever, dyspnoea, cough, and myalgia.\n\n The odds of admission to an intensive care unit (odds ratio 2.61, 95% confidence interval 1.84 to 3.71; I2=85.6%), and invasive ventilation (2.41, 2.13 to 2.71; I2=0%) were higher in pregnant and recently pregnant than non-pregnant women of reproductive age.\n\n Overall, 970 pregnant women (0.2%, 123 studies, 179 981 women) with confirmed covid-19 died from any cause.\n\n In pregnant women with covid-19, non-white ethnicity, increased maternal age, high body mass index, any pre-existing maternal comorbidity including chronic hypertension and diabetes, and pregnancy specific complications such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, were associated with serious complications (severe covid-19, admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, and maternal death).\n\n Compared to pregnant women without covid-19, those with the disease had increased odds of maternal death (odds ratio 6.09, 95% confidence interval 1.82 to 20.38; I2=76.6%), of admission to the intensive care unit (5.41, 3.59 to 8.14; I2=57.0%), caesarean section (1.17, 1.01 to 1.36; I2=80.3%), and of

babies born to women with covid-19 versus those without covid-19.\nConclusion\nPregnant and recently pregnant women with covid-19 attending or admitted to the hospitals for any reason are less likely to manifest symptoms such as fever, cough, dyspnoea, and myalgia, but are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit or needing invasive ventilation than non-pregnant women of reproductive age.\n\n Pre-existing comorbidities, non-white ethnicity, chronic hypertension, pre-existing diabetes, high maternal age, and high body mass index are risk factors for severe covid-19 outcomes in pregnancy.\n\n Pregnant women with covid-19 versus without covid-19 are more likely to deliver preterm and have an increased risk of maternal death and of being admitted to the intensive care

OR SARS-CoV-2 OR coronavirus disease 2019 OR COVID-19” AND “pregnancy.\n\n” We evaluated the methodologic quality of all included studies using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.\n\n Our primary outcomes were preeclampsia and preterm birth.\n\n Secondary outcomes included stillbirth, gestational diabetes and other pregnancy outcomes.\n\n We calculated summary odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects meta-analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nWe included 42 studies involving 438 548 people who were pregnant.\n\n Compared with no SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, COVID-19 was associated with preeclampsia (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.73), preterm birth (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.39) and stillbirth (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.90).\n\n Compared with mild COVID-19, severe COVID-19 was strongly associated with preeclampsia (OR 4.16, 95% CI 1.55 to 11.15), preterm birth (OR 4.29, 95% CI 2.41 to 7.63), gestational diabetes (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.64) and low birth weight (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.12).\n\n\nINTERPRETATION:\nCOVID-19 may be associated with increased risks of preeclampsia, preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8084555","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shu

of Thymus and Activation-Regulated Chemokine in Allergic Asthma","abstract":"Background\nAsthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by the predominant infiltration of inflammatory cells in the airways.\n\n Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine/C–C motif chemokine 17 (TARC/CCL17) is a chemokine responsible for trafficking T helper 2 cells into sites of allergic inflammation.\n\n\nObjective\nTo validate the role of TARC in association with clinical and inflammatory parameters in adult asthmatics.\n\n\nMethods\nWe enrolled 128 asthmatic patients and 70 healthy controls (HCs).\n\n Asthma-related clinical and laboratory parameters, including lung function and eosinophil counts, were measured.\n\n Serum levels of TARC, free immunoglobulin E (IgE), and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) were determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; serum total IgE level was measured using ImmunoCAP.\n\n The levels of inflammatory lipid mediators, such as leukotriene E4 (LTE4), 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), thromboxane B2 (TXB2), and prostaglandin F2? (PGF2?), were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.\n\n\nResults\nSerum TARC levels are significantly higher in asthmatics than in HCs and in allergic asthmatics than in HCs (P &lt; 0.010 for all), with significantly negative correlations between serum TARC levels and FEV1%/MMEF% values (r = ?0.314, r = ?0.268, P &lt; 0.050 for both).\n\n The patients with higher serum TARC levels had higher levels of serum total and free IgE levels (P &lt; 0.050 for both) with positive correlations to serum levels of EDN, TXB2, and 15-HETE (r = 0.233, r = 0.264, and r = 0.223, respectively, P &lt; 0.050 for all).\n\n\nConclusion\nWe suggest the role of TARC in allergic asthma via contributing to mast cell and eosinophilic inflammation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8828566","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Quang","surname":"Luu Quoc","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ji-Young","surname":"Moon","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ji-Young","surname":"Moon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong-Hyun","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ga-Young","surname":"Ban","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Seung-Hyun","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Seung-Hyun","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hae-Sim","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.gene.2020.145145","date":"2020-09-09","title":"Serum CCL17 level becomes a predictive marker to distinguish between mild/moderate and severe/critical disease in patients with COVID-19","abstract":"\n\n\n•\nCCL17, IFN- l 3, IL-6, IP-10, and CXCL9 were predictor for COVID-19 prognosis.\n","id":"PMC7489253","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Masaya","surname":"Sugiyama","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Noriko","surname":"Kinoshita","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Satoshi","surname":"Ide","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hidetoshi","surname":"Nomoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Takato","surname":"Nakamoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sho","surname":"Saito","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Masahiro","surname":"Ishikane","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Satoshi","surname":"Kutsuna","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kayoko","surname":"Hayakawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Masao","surname":"Hashimoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Manabu","surname":"Suzuki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shinyu","surname":"Izumi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Masayuki","surname":"Hojo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kiyoto","surname":"Tsuchiya","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hiroyuki","surname":"Gatanaga","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Takasaki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Masahide","surname":"Usami","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Toshikazu","surname":"Kano","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hidekatsu","surname":"Yanai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nao","surname":"Nishida","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tatsuya","surname":"Kanto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haruhito","surname":"Sugiyama","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Norio","surname":"Ohmagari","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Masashi","surname":"Mizokami","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Drugs and lactation database (LactMed): National Library of medicine (US)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cgh.2009.11.023","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Adalimumab level in breast milk of a nursing mother","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s43032-021-00681-5","date":"2021-06-25","title":"Unlikely SARS-CoV-2 Transmission During Vaginal Delivery","abstract":"id='Par1'>Pregnant women display a higher risk of progression to disease and higher viral loads during infections due to their more permissive, tolerogenic immune system.\n However, only few studies have focused on SARS-CoV-2 intrapartum vertical transmission via vaginal secretions or faeces.\n The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of the virus in vaginal, rectal and blood specimens from pregnant women characterized by different COVID-19 disease severity.\n We enrolled 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women, of which 46 (82%) were in the third trimester of pregnancy, 6 (10%) in the second and 4 (7%) in the first.\n QPCR was performed to detect the virus in vaginal and rectal swabs and in plasma samples.\n SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 27% of rectal swabs of pregnant women in the third trimester, while no virus particles were detected in vaginal swabs of the same patients.\n Furthermore, only 4% plasma samples tested positive to SARS-CoV-2.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was

full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without

outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

neonatal outcome: systematic review","abstract":"Objective\nTo evaluate the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) on maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcome by performing a systematic review of available published literature on pregnancies affected by COVID?19.\nMethods\nWe performed a systematic review to evaluate the effect of COVID?19 on pregnancy, perinatal and neonatal outcome.\n\n We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database and Wan Fang Data up to and including 20 April 2020 (studies were identified through PubMed alert after that date).\n\n For the search strategy, combinations of the following keywords and medical subject heading (MeSH) terms were used: ‘SARS?CoV?2’, ‘COVID?19’, ‘coronavirus disease 2019’, ‘pregnancy’, ‘gestation’, ‘maternal’, ‘mother’, ‘vertical transmission’, ‘maternal–fetal transmission’, ‘intrauterine transmission’, ‘neonate’, ‘infant’ and ‘delivery’.\n\n Eligibility criteria included laboratory?confirmed and/or clinically diagnosed COVID?19, patient being pregnant on admission and availability of clinical characteristics, including at least one maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcome.\n\n Exclusion criteria were non?peer?reviewed or unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study, suspicion of duplicate reporting and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes.\n\n No language restrictions were applied.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified a high number of relevant case reports and case series, but only 24 studies, including a total of 324 pregnant women with COVID?19, met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review.\n\n These comprised nine case series (eight consecutive) and 15 case reports.\n\n A total of 20 pregnant patients with laboratory?confirmed COVID?19 were included in the case reports.\n\n In the combined data from the eight consecutive case series, including 211 (71.5%) cases of laboratory?confirmed and 84 (28.5%) of clinically diagnosed COVID?19, the maternal age ranged from 20 to 44?years and the gestational age on admission ranged from 5 to 41?weeks.\n\n The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea/shortness of breath, fatigue and myalgia.\n\n The rate of severe pneumonia reported amongst the case series ranged from 0% to 14%, with the majority of the cases requiring admission to the intensive care unit.\n\n Almost all cases from the case series had positive computed tomography chest findings.\n\n All six and 22 cases that had nucleic?acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2).\n\n Only four cases of spontaneous miscarriage or termination were reported.\n\n In the consecutive case series, 219/295 women had delivered at the time of reporting and 78% of them had Cesarean section.\n\n The gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41?weeks.\n\n Apgar scores at both 1 and 5?min ranged from 7 to 10. Only eight neonates had birth weight &lt;?2500?g and nearly one?third of neonates were transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit.\n\n There was one case of neonatal asphyxia and death.\n\n In 155 neonates that had nucleic?acid testing in throat swab, all, except three cases, were negative for SARS?CoV?2. There were no cases of maternal death in the eight consecutive case series.\n\n Seven maternal deaths, four intrauterine fetal deaths (one with twin pregnancy) and two neonatal deaths (twin pregnancy) were reported in a non?consecutive case series of nine cases with severe COVID?19. In the case reports, two maternal deaths, one neonatal death and two cases of neonatal SARS?CoV?2 infection were reported.\n\n\nConclusions\nDespite the increasing number of published studies on COVID?19 in pregnancy, there are insufficient good?quality data to draw unbiased conclusions with regard to the severity of the disease or specific complications of COVID?19 in pregnant women, as well as vertical transmission, perinatal and neonatal complications.\n\n In order to answer specific questions in relation to the impact of COVID?19 on pregnant women and their fetuses, through meaningful good?quality research, we urge researchers and investigators to present complete outcome data and reference previously published cases in their publications, and to record such reporting when the data of a case are entered into one or several registries.\n\n © 2020 The Authors.\n\n Ultrasound in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7276742","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"J.","surname":"Juan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

of Biomedical Research: A Cross-Sectional Study","abstract":"Background\nSystematic reviews (SRs) can help decision makers interpret the deluge of published biomedical literature.\n\n However, a SR may be of limited use if the methods used to conduct the SR are flawed, and reporting of the SR is incomplete.\n\n To our knowledge, since 2004 there has been no cross-sectional study of the prevalence, focus, and completeness of reporting of SRs across different specialties.\n\n Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the epidemiological and reporting characteristics of a more recent cross-section of SRs.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nWe searched MEDLINE to identify potentially eligible SRs indexed during the month of February 2014. Citations were screened using prespecified eligibility criteria.\n\n Epidemiological and reporting characteristics of a random sample of 300 SRs were extracted by one reviewer, with a 10% sample extracted in duplicate.\n\n We compared characteristics of Cochrane versus non-Cochrane reviews, and the 2014 sample of SRs versus a 2004 sample of SRs.\n\n We identified 682 SRs, suggesting that more than 8,000 SRs are being indexed in MEDLINE annually, corresponding to a 3-fold increase over the last decade.\n\n The majority of SRs addressed a therapeutic question and were conducted by authors based in China, the UK, or the US; they included a median of 15 studies involving 2,072 participants.\n\n Meta-analysis was performed in 63% of SRs, mostly using standard pairwise methods.\n\n Study risk of bias/quality assessment was performed in 70% of SRs but was rarely incorporated into the analysis (16%).\n\n Few SRs (7%) searched sources of unpublished data, and the risk of publication bias was considered in less than half of SRs.\n\n Reporting quality was highly variable; at least a third of SRs did not report use of a SR protocol, eligibility criteria relating to publication status, years of coverage of the search, a full Boolean search logic for at least one database, methods for data extraction, methods for study risk of bias assessment, a primary outcome, an abstract conclusion that incorporated study limitations, or the funding source of the SR.\n\n Cochrane SRs, which accounted for 15% of the sample, had more complete reporting than all other types of SRs.\n\n Reporting has generally improved since 2004, but remains suboptimal for many characteristics.\n\n\nConclusions\nAn increasing number of SRs are being published, and many are poorly conducted and reported.\n\n Strategies are needed to help reduce this avoidable waste in research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4878797","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthew J.","surname":"Page","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Larissa","surname":"Shamseer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Douglas G.","surname":"Altman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jennifer","surname":"Tetzlaff","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Margaret","surname":"Sampson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrea C.","surname":"Tricco","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Andrea C.","surname":"Tricco","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ferrán","surname":"Catalá-López","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emma K.","surname":"Reid","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rafael","surname":"Sarkis-Onofre","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Moher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Low","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Low","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jclinepi.2018.08.019","date":"2018-08-31","title":"Lack of transparency in reporting narrative synthesis of quantitative data: a methodological assessment of systematic reviews","abstract":"Objective\nTo assess the adequacy of reporting and conduct of narrative synthesis of quantitative data (NS) in reviews evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions.\n\n\nStudy Design and Setting\nA retrospective comparison of a 20% (n = 474/2,372) random sample of public health systematic reviews from the McMaster Health Evidence database (January 2010–October 2015) to establish the proportion of reviews using NS.\n\n From those reviews using NS, 30% (n = 75/251) were randomly selected and data were extracted for detailed assessment of: reporting NS methods, management and investigation of heterogeneity, transparency of data presentation, and assessment of robustness of the synthesis.\n\n\nResults\nMost reviews used NS (56%, n = 251/446);

for synthesising evidence about the differential effects of interventions","abstract":"Background\nOne attraction of meta-analysis is the forest plot, a compact overview of the essential data included in a systematic review and the overall 'result'.\n\n However, meta-analysis is not always suitable for synthesising evidence about the effects of interventions which may influence the wider determinants of health.\n\n As part of a systematic review of the effects of population-level tobacco control interventions on social inequalities in smoking, we designed a novel approach to synthesis intended to bring aspects of the graphical directness of a forest plot to bear on the problem of synthesising evidence from a complex and diverse group of studies.\n\n\nMethods\nWe coded the included studies (n = 85) on two methodological dimensions (suitability of study design and quality of execution) and extracted data on effects stratified by up to six different dimensions of inequality (income, occupation, education, gender, race or ethnicity, and age), distinguishing between 'hard' (behavioural) and 'intermediate' (process or attitudinal) outcomes.\n\n Adopting a hypothesis-testing approach, we then assessed which of three competing hypotheses (positive social gradient, negative social gradient, or no gradient) was best supported by each study for each dimension of inequality.\n\n\nResults\nWe plotted the results on a matrix ('harvest plot') for each category of intervention, weighting studies by the methodological criteria and distributing them between the competing hypotheses.\n\n These matrices formed part of the analytical process and helped to encapsulate the output, for example by drawing attention to the finding that increasing the price of tobacco products may be more effective in discouraging smoking among people with lower incomes and in lower occupational groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe harvest plot is a novel and useful method for synthesising evidence about the differential effects of population-level interventions.\n\n It contributes to the challenge of making best use of all available evidence by incorporating all relevant data.\n\n The visual display assists both the process of synthesis and the assimilation of the findings.\n\n The method is suitable for adaptation to a variety of questions in evidence synthesis and may be particularly useful for systematic reviews addressing the broader type of research question which may be most relevant to policymakers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2270283","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David","surname":"Ogilvie","email":"dbo23@medschl.cam.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Debra","surname":"Fayter","email":"daf5@york.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Petticrew","email":"mark.petticrew@lshtm.ac.uk","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Amanda","surname":"Sowden","email":"ajs18@york.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sian","surname":"Thomas","email":"sian.thomas@btinternet.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Margaret","surname":"Whitehead","email":"mmw@liverpool.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gill","surname":"Worthy","email":"gc508@york.ac.uk","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/jrsm.1060","date":"2012-08-28","title":"The

2.5 million infections and 169,000 deaths worldwide (as of April 20, 2020), no maternal deaths and only a few pregnant women afflicted with severe respiratory morbidity have been reported to be related to COVID-19 disease.\n\n Given the disproportionate burden of severe and fatal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other coronavirus-related outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected.\n\n\nObjective\nTo describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease.\n\n\nStudy Design\nWe describe here a multiinstitution adjudicated case series from Iran that includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester.\n\n All 9 pregnant women received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid testing.\n\n Outcomes of these women were compared with their familial/household members with contact to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset.\n\n All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting, 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization.\n\n We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance, maternal outcomes were more severe compared with outcomes of other high- and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison).\n\n\nConclusion\nWe report herein maternal deaths owing to COVID-19 disease.\n\n Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerge, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed as having COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7187838","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sedigheh","surname":"Hantoushzadeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alireza

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

Pneumonia: A Longitudinal Study","abstract":"Background\nCT may play a central role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\nPurpose\nTo perform a longitudinal study to analyze the serial CT findings over time in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nDuring January 16 to February 17, 2020, 90 patients (male:female, 33:57; mean age, 45 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled and followed up until they were discharged or died, or until the end of the study.\n\n A total of 366 CT scans were acquired and reviewed by 2 groups of radiologists for the patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores and number of zones involved.\n\n Those features were analyzed for temporal change.\n\n\nResults\nCT scores and number of zones involved progressed rapidly, peaked during illness days 6-11 (median: 5 and 5), and followed by persistence of high levels.\n\n The predominant pattern of abnormalities after symptom onset was ground-glass opacity (35/78 [45%] to 49/79 [62%] in different periods).\n\n The percentage of mixed pattern peaked (30/78 [38%]) on illness days 12-17, and became the second most predominant pattern thereafter.\n\n Pure ground-glass opacity was the most prevalent sub-type of ground-glass opacity after symptom onset (20/50 [40%] to 20/28 [71%]).\n\n The percentage of ground-glass opacity with irregular linear opacity peaked on illness days 6-11 (14/50 [28%)]) and became the second most prevalent subtype thereafter.\n\n The distribution of lesions was predominantly bilateral and subpleural.\n\n 66/70 (94%) patients discharged had residual disease on final CT scans (median CT scores and zones involved: 4 and 4), with ground-glass opacity (42/70 [60%]) and pure ground-glass

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnant patients","abstract":"Background\nDuring the early months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, risks associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pregnancy were uncertain.\n\n Pregnant patients can serve as a model for the success of clinical and public health responses during public health emergencies as they are typically in frequent contact with the medical system.\n\n Population-based estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pregnancy are unknown because of incomplete ascertainment of pregnancy status or inclusion of only single centers or hospitalized cases.\n\n Whether pregnant women were protected by the public health response or through their interactions with obstetrical providers in the early months of pandemic is not clearly understood.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aimed to estimate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnancy and to examine the disparities by race and ethnicity and English language proficiency in Washington State.\n\n\nStudy Design\nPregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction–confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection diagnosed between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 were identified within 35 hospitals and clinics, capturing 61% of annual deliveries in Washington State.\n\n Infection rates in pregnancy were estimated overall and by Washington State Accountable Community of Health region and cross-sectionally compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State.\n\n Race and ethnicity and language used for medical care of pregnant patients were compared with recent data from Washington State.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 240 pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections were identified during the study period with 70.7% from minority racial and ethnic groups.\n\n The principal findings in our study were as follows: (1) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate was 13.9 per 1000 deliveries in pregnant patients (95% confidence interval, 8.3–23.2) compared with 7.3 per 1000 (95% confidence interval, 7.2–7.4) in adults aged 20 to 39 years in Washington State (rate ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–2.3); (2) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate reduced to 11.3 per 1000 deliveries (95% confidence interval, 6.3–20.3) when excluding 45 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 detected through asymptomatic screening (rate ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.96–1.9); (3) the proportion of pregnant patients in non-White racial and ethnic groups with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 infection was 2- to 4-fold higher than the race and ethnicity distribution of women in Washington State who delivered live births in 2018; and (4) the proportion of pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection receiving medical care in a non-English language was higher than estimates of pregnant patients receiving care with limited English proficiency in Washington State (30.4% vs 7.6%).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnant people was 70% higher than similarly aged adults in Washington State, which could not be completely explained by universal screening at delivery.\n\n Pregnant patients from nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups and patients receiving medical care in a non-English language were overrepresented.\n\n Pregnant women were not protected from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in the early months of the pandemic.\n\n Moreover, the greatest burden of infections occurred in nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups.\n\n These data coupled with a broader recognition that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe illness and maternal mortality strongly suggested that pregnant people should be broadly prioritized for coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine allocation in the United States similar to some states.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7884918","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Erica

The most common clinical manifestations of covid-19 in pregnancy were fever and cough (both 36%).\n\n Compared with non-pregnant women of reproductive age, pregnant and recently pregnant women with covid-19 were less likely to report symptoms of fever, dyspnoea, cough, and myalgia.\n\n The odds of admission to an intensive care unit (odds ratio 2.61, 95% confidence interval 1.84 to 3.71; I2=85.6%), and invasive ventilation (2.41, 2.13 to 2.71; I2=0%) were higher in pregnant and recently pregnant than non-pregnant women of reproductive age.\n\n Overall, 970 pregnant women (0.2%, 123 studies, 179 981 women) with confirmed covid-19 died from any cause.\n\n In pregnant women with covid-19, non-white ethnicity, increased maternal age, high body mass index, any pre-existing maternal comorbidity including chronic hypertension and diabetes, and pregnancy specific complications such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, were associated with serious complications (severe covid-19, admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, and maternal death).\n\n Compared to pregnant women without covid-19, those with the disease had increased odds of maternal death (odds ratio 6.09, 95% confidence interval 1.82 to 20.38; I2=76.6%), of admission to the intensive care unit (5.41, 3.59 to 8.14; I2=57.0%), caesarean section (1.17, 1.01 to 1.36; I2=80.3%), and of preterm birth (1.57, 1.36 to 1.81; I2=49.3%).\n\n The odds of stillbirth (1.81, 1.38 to 2.37, I2=0%), and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (2.18, 1.46 to 3.26, I2=85.4%) were higher in babies born to women with covid-19 versus those without covid-19.\nConclusion\nPregnant and recently pregnant women with covid-19 attending or admitted to the hospitals for any reason are less likely to manifest symptoms such as fever, cough, dyspnoea, and myalgia, but are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit or needing invasive ventilation than non-pregnant women of reproductive age.\n\n Pre-existing comorbidities, non-white ethnicity, chronic hypertension, pre-existing diabetes, high maternal age, and high body mass index are risk factors for severe covid-19 outcomes in pregnancy.\n\n Pregnant women with covid-19 versus without covid-19 are more likely to deliver preterm and have an increased risk of maternal death and of being admitted to the intensive care

During viral outbreaks, pregnancy poses a uniquely increased risk to women due to changes to immune function, alongside physiological adaptive alterations, such as increased oxygen consumption and edema of the respiratory tract.\n The laboratory derangements may be reminiscent of HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome, and thus knowledge of the COVID?19 relationship is paramount for appropriate diagnosis and management.\n In addition to routine measurements of D?dimers, prothrombin time, and platelet count in all patients presenting with COVID?19 as per International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) guidance, monitoring of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen levels should be considered in pregnancy, as highlighted in this report.\n These investigations in SARS?CoV?2?positive pregnant women are vital, as their derangement may signal a more severe COVID?19 infection, and may warrant pre?emptive

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

A first step in understanding SARS pathogenesis","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route.\n A distinct coronavirus (SARS?CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS.\n Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004

Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

RT-PCR.\n Histologically, all patients showed varying degrees of exudative and proliferative phase acute lung injury, evidenced in conventional and immunohistochemical stains by edema, inflammatory infiltrate, pneumocyte hyperplasia, fibrinous exudates, and organization.\n Eight of 20 patients showed predominantly a diffuse alveolar damage pattern of acute lung injury, six showed predominantly an acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia pattern, and the remainder showed an admixture of the two patterns.\n Squamous metaplasia and scattered multinucleate giant cells were present in most
