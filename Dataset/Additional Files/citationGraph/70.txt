Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong was studied.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pathology of the placentas was retrospectively studied in detail and compared with control sets.\n\n The clinical data of the women and neonates were also reviewed.\n\n\nResults\nA total of seven placentas were studied.\n\n The placentas from two women convalescent from SARS in the first trimester were normal.\n\n In three placentas delivered in the acute stage of SARS, there were increases in intervillous or subchorionic fibrin which might be related to disturbances in maternal placental blood flow due to the hypoxic respiratory disease.\n\n Extensive fetal thrombotic vasculopathy (FTV) with sharply demarcated zones of avascular fibrotic villi was noted in the placentas of two patients convalescent from SARS in the third trimester.\n\n Both pregnancies had intrauterine growth retardation, oligohydramnios and newborns small for gestation.\n\n The aetiology of the FTV might be related to thrombotic tendency due to SARS or placental hypoxia.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis report highlights placental pathology that was probably the result of pathophysiological alteration of the maternal fetal unit during SARS.\n\n Further

regression was significant only for masks (p=0·011).\n Practice of droplets precaution and contact precaution is adequate in significantly reducing the risk of infection after exposures to patients

Zika virus is a TORCH infection that produces a congenital malformation syndrome and pediatric neurodevelopmental abnormalities.\n Production of efficacious vaccines has been a public health priority for both infections.\n Unfortunately, during the clinical trials and subsequent deployment of a vaccine for the Ebola virus, pregnant and lactating women were, and continue to be, excluded from receiving the life-saving vaccine.\n The most serious consequence of Zika virus infection, congenital Zika syndrome, results from fetal infection during pregnancy.\n Thus, pregnant women have a major stake in the ongoing development of a vaccine for Zika virus.\n The exclusion of pregnant women from the development, clinical trials and administration of a potential Zika vaccine unfairly deprives them and their infants of the protection they need against this potentially catastrophic intrauterine infection.\n When creating policy about these issues, it is important to critically evaluate vaccine safety in pregnancy in the context of the substantial risk of infection for the pregnant woman and her fetus in the absence of immunization.\n","id":"PMC6313913","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Schwartz","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/vaccines8010038","date":"2020-01-19","title":"Being Pregnant during the Kivu Ebola Virus Outbreak in DR Congo: The rVSV-ZEBOV Vaccine and Its Accessibility by Mothers and Infants during Humanitarian Crises and in Conflict Areas","abstract":"The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that began in Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in July 2018 is the second largest in history.\n It is also the largest and most deadly of the ten Ebola outbreaks to occur in DRC, the country where Ebola was first identified during the 1976 Yambuku outbreak.\n The Kivu region is one of the most challenging locations in which to organize humanitarian assistance.\n It is an active conflict zone in which numerous armed groups are conducting violent acts, often directed against the inhabitants, healthcare and relief workers and peacekeepers.\n EVD has been especially problematic in pregnancy—previous outbreaks both in DRC and other countries have resulted in very high mortality rates among pregnant women and especially their infants, with maternal mortality in some outbreaks reaching over 90% and perinatal mortality 100%.\n The development and implementation of the Merck rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine for Ebola infection has been a tremendous public health advance in preventing EVD, being used successfully in both the West Africa Ebola epidemic and the Équateur DRC Ebola outbreak.\n But from the start of the Kivu outbreak, policy decisions had resulted in excluding pregnant and lactating women and their infants from receiving it during extensive ring vaccination efforts.\n In June 2019, this policy was reversed, 10 months after the start of the outbreak.\n Pregnant and lactating women are now permitted not only the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in the continuing Kivu outbreak but also the newly implemented Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN vaccine.\n","id":"PMC7157486","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Schwartz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s40475-019-00195-w","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Maternal and infant death and the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine through three recent Ebola virus epidemics-West Africa, DRC Equateur and DRC Kivu: 4 years of excluding pregnant and lactating women and their infants from immunization","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"CEPI to Fund Three Programmes to Develop Vaccines against the Novel Coronavirus, nCoV-2019. 23 January 2020","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A Dozen Vaccine Programs Underway as WHO Declares Coronavirus Public Health Emergency.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

of preterm infants and postnatal corticosteroids are used to treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\n\n\nObjective\nTo test if antenatal or postnatal corticosteroids would decrease resuscitation induced lung injury.\n\n\nMethods\n129 d gestational age lambs (n = 5-8/gp; term = 150 d) were operatively delivered and ventilated after exposure to either 1) no medication, 2) antenatal maternal IM Betamethasone 0.5 mg/kg 24 h prior to delivery, 3) 0.5 mg/kg Dexamethasone IV at delivery or 4) Cortisol 2 mg/kg IV at delivery.\n\n Lambs then were ventilated with no PEEP and escalating tidal volumes (VT) to 15 mL/kg for 15 min and then given surfactant.\n\n The lambs were ventilated with VT 8 mL/kg and PEEP 5 cmH20 for 2 h 45 min.\n\n\nResults\nHigh VT ventilation caused a deterioration of lung physiology, lung inflammation and injury.\n\n Antenatal betamethasone improved ventilation, decreased inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression and alveolar protein leak, but did not prevent neutrophil influx.\n\n Postnatal dexamethasone decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, but had no beneficial effect on ventilation, and postnatal cortisol had no effect.\n\n Ventilation increased liver serum amyloid mRNA expression, which was unaffected by corticosteroids.\n\n\nConclusions\nAntenatal betamethasone decreased lung injury without decreasing lung inflammatory cells or systemic acute phase responses.\n\n Postnatal dexamethasone or cortisol, at the doses tested, did not have important effects on lung function or injury, suggesting that corticosteroids given at birth will not decrease resuscitation mediated injury.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2802354","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Noah

modification by family history of allergies – a population based cross-sectional study","abstract":"Background\nStudies on the association of birth by caesarean section (C/S) and allergies have produced conflicting findings.\n\n Furthermore, evidence on whether this association may differ in those at risk of atopy is limited.\n\n This study aims to investigate the association of mode of delivery with asthma and atopic sensitization and the extent to which any effect is modified by family history of allergies.\n\n\nMethods\nAsthma outcomes were assessed cross-sectionally in 2216 children at age 8 on the basis of parents’ responses to the ISAAC questionnaire whilst skin prick tests to eleven aeroallergens were also performed in a subgroup of 746 children.\n\n Adjusted odds ratios of asthma and atopy by mode of delivery were estimated in multivariable logistic models while evidence of effect modification was examined by introducing interaction terms in the models.\n\n\nResults\nAfter adjusting for potential confounders, children born by C/S appeared significantly more likely than those born vaginally to report ever wheezing (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.07-1.71), asthma diagnosis (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09-1.83) and be atopic (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.08-2.60).\n\n There was modest evidence that family history of allergies may modify the effect of C/S delivery on atopy (p for effect modification=0.06) but this was not the case for the asthma outcomes.\n\n Specifically, while more than a two-fold increase in the odds of being a topic was observed in children with a family history of allergies if born by C/S (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.38-5.00), no association was observed in children without a family history of allergies (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.64-2.11).\n\n\nConclusions\nBirth by C/S is associated with asthma and atopic sensitization in childhood.\n\n The association of C/S and atopy appears more pronounced in children with family history of allergies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3511167","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ourania","surname":"Kolokotroni","email":"ourania.kolokotroni@cut.ac.cy","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicos","surname":"Middleton","email":"nicos.middleton@cut.ac.cy","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marina","surname":"Gavatha","email":"jcjianni@yahoo.gr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Demetris","surname":"Lamnisos","email":"demetris.lamnisos@cut.ac.cy","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kostas

neonatal insults: a systematic review","abstract":"Background\nNeonatal interventions are largely focused on reduction of mortality and progression towards Millennium Development Goal 4 (child survival).\n\n However, little is known about the global burden of long-term consequences of intrauterine and neonatal insults.\n\n We did a systematic review to estimate risks of long-term neurocognitive and other sequelae after intrauterine and neonatal insults, especially in low-income and middle-income countries.\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Library, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1966, and June 30, 2011, that reported neurodevelopmental sequelae after preterm or neonatal insult.\n\n For unpublished studies and grey literature, we searched Dissertation Abstracts International and the WHO library.\n\n We reviewed publications that had data for long-term outcome after defined neonatal insults.\n\n We summarised the results with medians and IQRs, and calculated the risk of at least one sequela after insult.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 28?212 studies identified by our search, 153 studies were suitable for inclusion, documenting 22?161 survivors of intrauterine or neonatal insults.\n\n The overall median risk of at least one sequela in any domain was 39·4% (IQR 20·0–54·8), with a risk of at least one severe impairment in any insult domain of 18·5% (7·7–33·3), of at least one moderate impairment of 5·0% (0·0–13·3%), and of at least one mild impairment of 10·0% (1·4–17·9%).\n\n The pooled risk estimate of at least one sequela (weighted mean) associated with one or more of the insults studied (excluding HIV) was 37·0% (95% CI 27·0–48·0%) and this risk was not significantly affected by region, duration of the follow-up, study design, or period of data collection.\n\n The most common sequelae were learning difficulties, cognition, or developmental delay (n=4032; 59%); cerebral palsy (n=1472; 21%); hearing impairment (n=1340; 20%); and visual impairment (n=1228; 18%).\n\n Only 40 (26%) studies included data for multidomain impairments.\n\n These studies included 2815 individuals, of whom 1048 (37%) had impairments, with 334 (32%) having multiple impairments.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIntrauterine and neonatal insults have a high risk of causing substantial long-term neurological morbidity.\n\n Comparable cohort studies in resource-poor regions should be done to properly assess the burden of these conditions, and long-term outcomes, such as chronic disease, and to inform policy and programme investments.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Saving Newborn Lives, and the Wellcome Trust.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3273721","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael

injury in very preterm lambs","abstract":"Background\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is closely associated with ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) in very preterm infants.\n\n The greatest risk of VILI may be in the immediate period after birth, when the lungs are surfactant deficient, still partially filled with liquid and not uniformly aerated.\n\n However, there have been very few studies that have examined this immediate post-birth period and identified the initial injury-related pathways that are activated.\n\n We aimed to determine if the early response genes; connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), cysteine rich-61 (CYR61) and early growth response 1 (EGR1), were rapidly induced by VILI in preterm lambs and whether ventilation with different tidal volumes caused different inflammatory cytokine and early response gene expression.\n\n\nMethods\nTo identify early markers of VILI, preterm lambs (132 d gestational age; GA, term ~147 d) were resuscitated with an injurious ventilation strategy (VT 20 mL/kg for 15 min) then gently ventilated (5 mL/kg) for 15, 30, 60 or 120 min (n = 4 in each).\n\n To determine if early response genes and inflammatory cytokines were differentially regulated by different ventilation strategies, separate groups of preterm lambs (125 d GA; n = 5 in each) were ventilated from birth with a VT of 5 (VG5) or 10 mL/kg (VG10) for 135 minutes.\n\n Lung gene expression levels were compared to levels prior to ventilation in age-matched control fetuses.\n\n\nResults\nCTGF, CYR61 and EGR1 lung mRNA levels were increased ~25, 50 and 120-fold respectively (p &lt; 0.05), within 30 minutes of injurious ventilation.\n\n VG5 and VG10 caused significant increases in CTGF, CYR61, EGR1, IL1-?, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels compared to control levels.\n\n CTGF, CYR61, IL-6 and IL-8 expression levels were higher in VG10 than VG5 lambs; although only the IL-6 and CYR61 mRNA levels reached significance.\n\n\nConclusion\nCTGF, CYR61 and EGR1 may be novel early markers of lung injury and mechanical ventilation from birth using relatively low tidal volumes may be less injurious than using higher tidal volumes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2662809","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Megan

novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

NxTAG?Respiratory Pathogen Panel and RespiFinder?22 for multiplex detection of respiratory pathogens","abstract":"Respiratory tract infection (RTI) involves a variety of viruses and bacteria, which can be conveniently detected by multiplex nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT).\n To compare the novel Luminex?based NxTAG?Respiratory Pathogen Panel (NxTAG?RPP) with the routine multiplex?ligation?NAT based RespiFinder?22® (RF?22), 282 respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs (71%), broncho?alveolar lavage (27%), throat swabs, tracheal secretions, and sputum (2%) from 116 children and 155 adults were extracted using a Corbett CAS1200 (Qiagen), and analyzed in parallel by the routine RF?22 and NxTAG?RPP.\n Concordant results were obtained in 263 (93.3%) cases consisting of concordant positives in 167 (59.2%) and concordant negatives in 96 (34%).\n Results were discordant in 19 (6.7%) consisting of 15 positive:negative, and 4 negative:positive results by NxTAG?RPP versus RF?22, respectively.\n Co?infections were observed in 10.3% with NxTAG?RPP and in 5.9% with RF?22. Most additional viral pathogens identified by the NxTAG?RPP involved dual infections with rhinovirus and RSV.\n Discordant samples were mainly due to low genome signals of Ct less than 36, when retested by QNAT suggesting a higher sensitivity of the NxTAG?RPP, also when detecting multiple infections.\n Hands?on time after extraction for 24 and 96 samples was 0.25 and &lt;0.5?hr for the NxTAG?RPP, and 2 and 4?hr for the RF?22, respectively.\n The median turn?around time was 6?hr (range 5–7?hr) for NxTAG?RPP and 12?hr (range 8–16?hr) for RF?22. The NxTAG?RPP showed comparable detection rates for most respiratory pathogens, while hands?on and turn?around time were considerably shorter.\n The clinical significance of detecting multiple viruses needs further clinical evaluation.\n \nJ.\n Med.\n Virol.\n 88:1319–1324, 2016\n.\n © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n","id":"PMC7166946","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Christiane","surname":"Beckmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hans H.","surname":"Hirsch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1009.040058","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Viral Loads in Clinical Specimens and SARS Manifestations","abstract":"The number of anatomical sites with detectable viral loads by RT-qPCR appeared to correlate with death risk.\n","id":"PMC3320271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"I.F.N.","surname":"Hung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"V.C.C.","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.K.L.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"B.S.F.","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"K.H.","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"C.M.","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.M.L.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"W.T.","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L.L.M.","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.M.W.","surname":"Tse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"K.S.","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.C.Y.","surname":"Woo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.K.P.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.S.M.","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"K.Y.","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0732-8893(02)00484-4","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Development of a multiplex real-time quantitative PCR assay to detect Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in respiratory tract secretions","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1086/381207","date":"2003-08-05","title":"Frequent Detection of Human Coronaviruses in Clinical Specimens from Patients with Respiratory Tract Infection by Use of a Novel Real-Time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","abstract":"During the past years, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been increasingly identified as pathogens associated with more-severe respiratory tract infection (RTI).\n Diagnostic tests for HCoVs are not frequently used in the routine setting.\n It is likely that, as a result, the precise role that HCoVs play in RTIs is greatly underestimated.\n We describe a rapid, sensitive, and highly specific quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of HCoV that can easily be implemented in the routine diagnostic setting.\n HCoV was detected in 28 (11%) of the 261 clinical specimens obtained from patients presenting with symptoms of RTI ranging from common cold to severe pneumonia.\n Only 1 (0.4%) of the 243 control specimens obtained from patients without symptoms of RTI showed the presence of HCoV.\n We conclude that HCoVs can be frequently detected in patients presenting with RTI.\n Real-time RT-PCR provides a tool for large-scale epidemiological studies to further clarify the role that coronavirus infection plays in RTI in humans.\n","id":"PMC7110206","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Leontine J.

0.001).\n With the NxTAG Assay, the detection rates were significantly higher for respiratory syncytial virus (P = 0.003), human metapneumovirus (P &lt; 0.001), human rhinovirus/human enterovirus (P = 0.009) and human adenovirus (P &lt; 0.001).\n Finally, the NxTAG Assay identified M.\n pneumoniae in 32 of 44 (72.7%) PCR-positive samples.\n However, the concordance with real-time PCR results was low for both assays.\n In conclusion, the results indicate that the NxTAG Assay overcomes some of the limitations of previous Luminex assays, although further studies are needed for a more complete evaluation of the new assay.\n","id":"PMC7132749","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Susanna","surname":"Esposito","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alessia","surname":"Scala","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sonia","surname":"Bianchini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria Lory","surname":"Presicce","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alessandro","surname":"Mori","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Calogero Sathya","surname":"Sciarrabba","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giulia","surname":"Fior","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Principi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evaluation of directigen flu A+B test for rapid diagnosis of influenza A and B virus infections","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection of influenza A virus from different species by PCR amplification of conserved sequences in the matrix gene","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Spectrum of clinical illness in hospitalized patients with &quot;common cold&quot;

These two regions are understood to form a fusion-active conformation similar to those of other typical viral fusion proteins.\n This hairpin structure likely juxtaposes the viral and cellular membranes, thus facilitating membrane fusion and subsequent viral entry.\n The fusion core protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein was crystallized, and the structure was determined at 2.8 Å of resolution.\n The fusion core is a six-helix bundle with three HR2 helices packed against the hydrophobic grooves on the surface of central coiled coil formed by three parallel HR1 helices in an oblique antiparallel manner.\n This structure shares significant similarity with the fusion core structure of mouse hepatitis virus spike protein and other viral fusion proteins, suggesting a conserved mechanism of membrane fusion.\n Drug discovery strategies aimed at inhibiting viral entry by blocking hairpin formation, which have been successfully used in human immunodeficiency virus 1 inhibitor development, may be applicable to the inhibition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus on the basis of structural information provided here.\n The relatively deep grooves on the surface of the central coiled coil will be a good target site for the design of viral fusion

generation of emerging and re?emerging infections in humans.\n The prime examples of these are the lyssaviruses and Henipavirus.\n The transmission of Nipah, Hendra and perhaps SARS coronavirus and Ebola virus to humans may involve intermediate amplification hosts such as pigs, horses, civets and primates, respectively.\n Understanding of the natural reservoir or introductory host, the amplifying host, the epidemic centre and at?risk human populations are crucial in the control of emerging zoonosis.\n The association between the bat coronaviruses and certain lyssaviruses with particular bat species implies co?evolution between specific viruses and bat hosts.\n Cross?infection between the huge number of bat species may generate new viruses which are able to jump the trans?mammalian species barrier more efficiently.\n The currently known viruses that have been found in bats are reviewed and the risks of transmission to humans are highlighted.\n Certain families of bats including the Pteropodidae, Molossidae, Phyllostomidae, and Vespertilionidae are most frequently associated with known human pathogens.\n A systematic survey of bats is warranted to better

in horseshoe bats since 2005 in different areas of China.\n However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV.\n Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China.\n The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of

pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

virus detection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.\n\n To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5?×?104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2?×?104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains.\n\n Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains.\n\n Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by

important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be

re-emerging epizootic swine virus","abstract":"The enteric disease of swine recognized in the early 1970s in Europe was initially described as “epidemic viral diarrhea” and is now termed “porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED)”.\n The coronavirus referred to as PED virus (PEDV) was determined to be the etiologic agent of this disease in the late 1970s.\n Since then the disease has been reported in Europe and Asia, but the most severe outbreaks have occurred predominantly in Asian swine-producing countries.\n Most recently, PED first emerged in early 2013 in the United States that caused high morbidity and mortality associated with PED, remarkably affecting US pig production, and spread further to Canada and Mexico.\n Soon thereafter, large-scale PED epidemics recurred through the pork industry in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.\n These recent outbreaks and global re-emergence of PED require urgent attention and deeper understanding of PEDV biology and pathogenic mechanisms.\n This paper highlights the current knowledge of molecular epidemiology, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of PEDV, as well as prevention and control measures against PEDV infection.\n More information about the virus and the disease is still necessary for the development of effective vaccines and control strategies.\n It is hoped that this review will stimulate further basic and applied studies and encourage collaboration among producers, researchers, and swine veterinarians to provide answers that improve our understanding of PEDV and PED in an effort to eliminate this economically significant viral disease, which emerged or re-emerged worldwide.\n","id":"PMC4687282","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Changhee","surname":"Lee","email":"changhee@knu.ac.kr","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1155/2015/424860","date":"2015-03-23","title":"Progress and Challenges toward the Development of Vaccines against Avian Infectious Bronchitis","abstract":"Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a widely distributed poultry disease that has huge economic impact on poultry industry.\n The continuous emergence of new IBV genotypes and lack of cross protection among different IBV genotypes have been an important challenge.\n Although live attenuated IB vaccines remarkably induce potent immune response, the potential risk of reversion to virulence, neutralization by the maternal antibodies, and recombination and mutation events are important concern on their usage.\n On the other hand, inactivated vaccines induce a weaker immune response and may require multiple dosing and/or the use of adjuvants that probably have potential safety risks and increased economic burdens.\n Consequently, alternative IB vaccines are widely sought.\n Recent advances in recombinant DNA technology have resulted in experimental IB vaccines that show promise in antibody and T-cells responses, comparable to live attenuated vaccines.\n Recombinant DNA vaccines have also been enhanced to target multiple serotypes and their efficacy has been improved using delivery vectors, nanoadjuvants, and in ovo vaccination approaches.\n Although most recombinant IB DNA vaccines are yet to be licensed, it is expected that these types of vaccines may hold sway as future vaccines for inducing a cross protection against multiple IBV serotypes.\n","id":"PMC4411447","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Faruku","surname":"Bande","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Siti

study sought to determine whether human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are associated with upper respiratory tract infections among older children and adults in Ghana.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a case control study among older children and adults in three rural areas of Ghana using asymptomatic subjects as controls.\n\n Nasal/Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HCoV-22E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 using Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction.\n\n\nResults\nOut of 1,213 subjects recruited, 150 (12.4%) were positive for one or more viruses.\n\n Of these, single virus detections occurred in 146 subjects (12.0%) and multiple detections occurred in 4 (0.3%).\n\n Compared with control subjects, infections with HCoV-229E

strains were identified among 823 (597 immunocompetent and 226 immunocompromised) patients admitted to hospital with acute respiratory syndromes.\n Viral infections were diagnosed by either immunological (monoclonal antibodies) or molecular (RT?PCR) methods.\n Each of two sets of primer pairs developed for detection of all CoVs (panCoV) failed to detect 15 of the 53 (28.3%) hCoV strains identified.\n On the other hand, all hCoV strains could be detected by using type?specific primers targeting genes 1ab and N.\n The HuH?7 cell line was found to be susceptible to isolation and identification of OC43? and 229E?like strains.\n Overall, hCoV infection was caused by OC43?like, 229E?like, and NL63?like strains in 25 (53.2%), 10 (21.3%), and 9 (19.1%) patients, respectively.\n In addition, three patients (6.4%) were infected by untypeable hCoV strains.\n NL63?like strains were not found to circulate in 2003–2004, and 229E?like strains did not circulate in 2004–2005, while OC43?like strains were detected in both seasons.\n The monthly distribution reached a peak during January through March.\n Lower predominated over upper respiratory tract infections in each age group.\n In addition, hCoV infections interested only immunocompetent infants and young children during the first year of life, while all adults were immunocompromised patients.\n Coinfections of hCoVs and other respiratory viruses (mostly interesting the first year of life) were observed in 14 of the 47 (29.8%) patients and were associated with severe respiratory syndromes more frequently than hCoV single infections (P?=?0.002).\n In conclusion, the use of multiple primer sets targeting different genes is recommended for diagnosis of all types of hCoV infection.\n In addition, the detection of still untypeable hCoV strains suggests that the number of hCoVs involved in human pathology might further increase.\n Finally, hCoVs should be screened routinely for in both infants and immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory infection.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n 78:938–949, 2006. © 2006 Wiley?Liss,

Envelope Protein Is a Determinant of Viral Pathogenesis","abstract":"A recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) lacking the envelope (E) protein is attenuated in vivo.\n Here we report that E protein PDZ-binding motif (PBM), a domain involved in protein-protein interactions, is a major determinant of virulence.\n Elimination of SARS-CoV E protein PBM by using reverse genetics caused a reduction in the deleterious exacerbation of the immune response triggered during infection with the parental virus and virus attenuation.\n Cellular protein syntenin was identified to bind the E protein PBM during SARS-CoV infection by using three complementary strategies, yeast two-hybrid, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy assays.\n Syntenin redistributed from the nucleus to the cell cytoplasm during infection with viruses containing the E protein PBM, activating p38 MAPK and leading to the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines.\n Silencing of syntenin using siRNAs led to a decrease in p38 MAPK activation in SARS-CoV infected cells, further reinforcing their functional relationship.\n Active p38 MAPK was reduced in lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoVs lacking E protein PBM as compared with the parental virus, leading to a decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and to virus attenuation.\n Interestingly, administration of a p38 MAPK inhibitor led to an increase in mice survival after infection with SARS-CoV, confirming the relevance of this pathway in SARS-CoV virulence.\n Therefore, the E protein PBM is a virulence domain that activates immunopathology most likely by using syntenin as a mediator of p38 MAPK induced

coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in humans has focused attention on understanding its origins.\n Here, we assess phylogenetic relationships for the SARS-CoV lineage as well as the history of host-species shifts

three avian coronaviruses).\n These different topologies are statistically significant: the optimal 5? tree could be rejected for the 3? region, and the optimal 3? tree could be rejected for the 5? region.\n We did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of N and S, as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees.\n Comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses, representing coronavirus groups 1–3 and SARS-CoV, based on N showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses.\n Inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously.\n However, current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat, chicken and

coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Because coronavirus spike glycoproteins (S) mediate virus entry, affect viral host range, and elicit neutralizing antibodies, analyzing the functions of MERS-CoV S protein is a high research priority.\n MERS-CoV S on lentivirus pseudovirions mediated entry into a variety of cell types including embryo cells from New World Eptesicus fuscus bats.\n Surprisingly, a polyclonal antibody to the S protein of MHV, a group a murine betacoronavirus, cross-reacted in immunoblots with the S2 domain of group c MERS-CoV spike protein.\n MERS pseudovirions released from 293T cells contained only uncleaved S, and pseudovirus entry was blocked by lysosomotropic reagents NH4Cl and bafilomycin and inhibitors of cathepsin L.\n However, when MERS pseudovirions with uncleaved S protein were adsorbed at 4°C to Vero E6 cells, brief trypsin treatment at neutral pH triggered virus entry at the plasma membrane and syncytia formation.\n When 293T cells producing MERS pseudotypes

protein on MERS pseudovirions is uncleaved, then viruses enter by endocytosis in a cathepsin L-dependent manner, but if MERS-CoV S is cleaved, either during virus maturation by serine proteases or on pseudovirions by trypsin in extracellular fluids, then viruses enter at the plasma membrane at neutral pH and cause massive syncytia formation even in cells that express little or no MERS-CoV receptor.\n Thus, whether MERS-CoV enters cells within endosomes or at the plasma membrane depends upon the host cell type and tissue, and is determined by the location of host proteases that cleave the viral spike glycoprotein and activate membrane fusion.\n","id":"PMC3789674","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhaohui","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samuel

protein and lipid charge","abstract":"A partial characterization of the ion channels formed by the SARS coronavirus (CoV) envelope (E) protein was previously reported (C.\n Verdiá-Báguena et al.\n, 2012 [12]).\n Here, we provide new significant insights on the involvement of lipids in the structure and function of the CoV E protein channel on the basis of three series of experiments.\n First, reversal potential measurements over a wide range of pH allow the dissection of the contributions to channel selectivity coming from ionizable residues of the protein transmembrane domain and also from the negatively charged groups of diphytanoyl phosphatidylserine (DPhPS) lipid.\n The corresponding effective pKas are consistent with the model pKas of the acidic residue candidates for titration.\n Second, the change of channel conductance with salt concentration reveals two distinct regimes (Donnan-controlled electrodiffusion and bulk-like electrodiffusion) fully compatible with the outcomes of selectivity experiments.\n Third, by measuring channel conductance in mixtures of neutral diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) lipids and negatively charged DPhPS lipids in low and high salt concentrations we conclude that the protein–lipid conformation in the channel is likely the same in charged and neutral lipids.\n Overall, the whole set of experiments supports the proteolipidic structure of SARS-CoV E channels and explains the large difference in channel conductance observed between neutral and charged membranes.\n","id":"PMC3715572","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carmina","surname":"Verdiá-Báguena","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jose

Flexibility and Conformational Selection in the Binding Promiscuity of PDZ Domains","abstract":"In molecular recognition, it is often the case that ligand binding is coupled to conformational change in one or both of the binding partners.\n Two hypotheses describe the limiting cases involved; the first is the induced fit and the second is the conformational selection model.\n The conformational selection model requires that the protein adopts conformations that are similar to the ligand-bound conformation in the absence of ligand, whilst the induced-fit model predicts that the ligand-bound conformation of the protein is only accessible when the ligand is actually bound.\n The flexibility of the apo protein clearly plays a major role in these interpretations.\n For many proteins involved in signaling pathways there is the added complication that they are often promiscuous in that they are capable of binding to different ligand partners.\n The relationship between protein flexibility and promiscuity is an area of active research and is perhaps best exemplified by the PDZ domain family of proteins.\n In this study we use molecular dynamics simulations to examine the relationship between flexibility and promiscuity in five PDZ domains: the human Dvl2 (Dishevelled-2) PDZ domain, the human Erbin PDZ domain, the PDZ1 domain of InaD (inactivation no after-potential D protein) from fruit fly, the PDZ7 domain of GRIP1 (glutamate receptor interacting protein 1) from rat and the PDZ2 domain of PTP-BL (protein tyrosine phosphatase) from mouse.\n We show that despite their high structural similarity, the PDZ binding sites have significantly different dynamics.\n Importantly, the degree of binding pocket flexibility was found to be closely related to the various characteristics of peptide binding specificity and promiscuity of the five PDZ domains.\n Our findings suggest that the intrinsic motions of the apo structures play a key role in distinguishing functional properties of different PDZ domains and allow us to make predictions that can be experimentally tested.\n","id":"PMC3486844","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Márton","surname":"Münz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jotun","surname":"Hein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philip

an Attenuated SARS-CoV for the Design of a Genetically Stable Vaccine","abstract":"A SARS-CoV lacking the full-length E gene (SARS-CoV-?E) was attenuated and an effective vaccine.\n Here, we show that this mutant virus regained fitness after serial passages in cell culture or in vivo, resulting in the partial duplication of the membrane gene or in the insertion of a new sequence in gene 8a, respectively.\n The chimeric proteins generated in cell culture increased virus fitness in vitro but remained attenuated in mice.\n In contrast, during SARS-CoV-?E passage in mice, the virus incorporated a mutated variant of 8a protein, resulting in reversion to a virulent phenotype.\n When the full-length E protein was deleted or its PDZ-binding motif (PBM) was mutated, the revertant viruses either incorporated a novel chimeric protein with a PBM or restored the sequence of the PBM on the E protein, respectively.\n Similarly, after passage in mice, SARS-CoV-?E protein 8a mutated, to now encode a PBM, and also regained virulence.\n These data indicated that the virus requires a PBM on a transmembrane protein to compensate for removal of this motif from the E protein.\n To increase the genetic stability of the vaccine candidate, we introduced small attenuating deletions in E gene that did not affect the endogenous PBM, preventing the incorporation of novel chimeric proteins in the virus genome.\n In addition, to increase vaccine biosafety, we introduced additional attenuating mutations into the nsp1 protein.\n Deletions in the carboxy-terminal region of nsp1 protein led to higher host interferon responses and virus attenuation.\n Recombinant viruses including attenuating mutations in E and nsp1 genes maintained their attenuation after passage in vitro and in vivo.\n Further, these viruses fully protected mice against challenge with the lethal parental virus, and are therefore safe and stable vaccine candidates for protection against

single predicted hydrophobic domain (HD), and has a poorly defined role in infection.\n The E protein is thought to promote virion assembly, which occurs in the Golgi region of infected cells.\n It has also been implicated in the release of infectious particles after budding.\n The E protein has ion channel activity in vitro, although a role for channel activity in infection has not been established.\n Furthermore, the membrane topology of the E protein is of considerable debate, and the protein may adopt more than one topology during infection.\n We previously showed that the HD of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E protein is required for the efficient release of infectious virus, an activity that correlated with disruption of the secretory pathway.\n Here we report that a single residue within the hydrophobic domain, Thr16, is required for secretory pathway disruption.\n Substitutions of other residues for Thr16 were not tolerated.\n Mutations of Thr16 did not impact virus assembly as judged by virus-like particle production, suggesting that alteration of secretory pathway and assembly are independent activities.\n We also examined how the membrane topology of IBV E affected its function by generating mutant versions that adopted either a transmembrane or membrane hairpin topology.\n We found that a transmembrane topology was required for disrupting the

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) M co-expression with either N or E is sufficient for producing virus-like particles (VLPs), although at a lower level compared to M, N and E co-expression.\n\n Whether E can release from cells or E/N interaction exists so as to contribute to enhanced VLP production is unknown.\n\n It also remains to be determined whether E palmitoylation or disulfide bond formation plays a role in SARS-CoV virus assembly.\n\n\nResults\nSARS-CoV N is released from cells through an association with E protein-containing vesicles.\n\n Further analysis suggests that domains involved in E/N interaction are largely located in both carboxyl-terminal regions.\n\n Changing all three E cysteine residues to alanines did not exert negative effects on E release, E association with N, or E enhancement of VLP production, suggesting that E palmitoylation modification or disulfide bond formation is not required for SARS-CoV virus assembly.\n\n We found

ORF7a expression was associated with blockage of cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase in HEK 293 cells after 24 to 60 h post-transfection.\n Similar results were observed in COS-7 and Vero cells.\n Mutation analysis of ORF7a revealed that the domain spanning aa 44–82 of 7a protein was essential for its cytoplasmic localization and for induction of the cell cycle arrest.\n After analyzing the cellular proteins involving in regulation of cell cycle progression, we demonstrated that ORF7a expression was correlated with a significant reduction of cyclin D3 level of mRNA transcription and

The M2 LIR is required for LC3 redistribution to the plasma membrane in virus-infected cells.\n Mutations in M2 that abolish LC3 binding interfere with filamentous budding and reduce virion stability.\n IAV therefore subverts autophagy by mimicking a host short linear protein-protein interaction motif.\n This strategy may facilitate transmission of infection between organisms by enhancing the stability of viral progeny.\n","id":"PMC3991421","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rupert","surname":"Beale","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Helen","surname":"Wise","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amanda","surname":"Stuart","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Ravenhill","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Digard","email":"paul.digard@roslin.ed.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Felix","surname":"Randow","email":"randow@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/mSystems.00135-17","date":"2017-12-27","title":"Host-Virus Protein Interaction Network Reveals the Involvement of Multiple Host Processes in the Life Cycle of Hepatitis E Virus","abstract":"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a pathogen that is transmitted by the fecal-oral route.\n Owing to the lack of an efficient laboratory model, the life cycle of the virus is poorly understood.\n During the course of infection, interactions between the viral and host proteins play essential roles, a clear understanding of which is essential to decode the life cycle of the virus.\n In this study, we identified the direct host interaction partners of all HEV proteins and generated a PPI network.\n Our functional analysis of the HEV-human PPI network reveals a role of HEV proteins in modulating multiple host biological processes such as stress and immune responses, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, energy and iron metabolism, and protein translation.\n Further investigations revealed an essential role of several host factors in HEV replication.\n Collectively, the results from our study provide a vast resource of PPI data from HEV and its human host and identify the molecular components of the viral translation/replication machinery.\n","id":"PMC5781259","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chandru","surname":"Subramani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vidya P.","surname":"Nair","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saumya","surname":"Anang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sukhen Das","surname":"Mandal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Madhu","surname":"Pareek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nidhi","surname":"Kaushik","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Akriti","surname":"Srivastava","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sudipto","surname":"Saha","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"Shalimar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Baibaswata","surname":"Nayak","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"C.

permeabilization which allowed us to better visualize the membrane structures at the ER-Golgi boundary.\n The MHV budding compartment shares membrane continuities with the rough ER as well as with cisternal elements on one side of the Golgi stack.\n It also labeled with p58 and rab2, two markers of the intermediate compartment, and with PDI, usually considered to be a marker of the rough ER.\n The membranes of the budding compartment, as well as the budding virions themselves, but not the rough ER, labeled with the N-acetyl- galactosamine (GalNAc)-specific lectin Helix pomatia.\n When the SLO- permeabilized cells were treated with guanosine 5'-(3-O- thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), the budding compartment accumulated a large number of beta-cop-containing buds and vesicular profiles.\n Complementary biochemical experiments were carried out to determine whether vesicular transport was required for the newly synthesized M protein, that contains only O-linked oligosaccharides, to acquire first, GalNAc and second, the Golgi modifications galactose and sialic acid.\n The results from both in vivo studies and from the use of SLO- permeabilized cells showed that, while GalNAc addition occurred under conditions which block vesicular transport, both cytosol and ATP were prerequisites for the M protein oligosaccharides to acquire Golgi modifications.\n Collectively, our data argue that transport from the rough ER to the Golgi complex requires only one vesicular transport step and that the intermediate compartment is a specialized domain of the endoplasmatic reticulum that

about the function of individual viral proteins, the role of the HCV p7 protein in virus replication is not known.\n Recent data, however, suggest that it forms ion channels that may be targeted by antiviral compounds.\n Moreover, this protein was shown to be essential for infectivity in chimpanzee.\n Employing the novel HCV infection system and using a genetic approach to investigate the function of p7 in the viral replication cycle, we find that this protein is essential for efficient assembly and release of infectious virions across divergent virus strains.\n We show that p7 promotes virus particle production in a genotype-specific manner most likely due to interactions with other viral factors.\n Virus entry, on the other hand, is largely independent of p7, as the specific infectivity of released virions with a defect in p7 was not affected.\n Together, these observations indicate that p7 is primarily involved in the late phase of the HCV replication cycle.\n Finally, we note that p7 variants from different isolates deviate substantially in their capacity to promote virus production, suggesting that p7 is an important virulence factor that may modulate fitness and in turn virus persistence and

Viroporins are a group of proteins that interact with plasma membranes modifying permeability and can promote the release of viral particles.\n While these proteins are not essential for virus replication, their activity certainly promotes virus growth.\n Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a fatal demyelinating disease resulting from lytic infection of oligodendrocytes by the polyomavirus JC virus (JCV).\n The genome of JCV encodes six major proteins including a small auxiliary protein known as agnoprotein.\n Studies on other polyomavirus agnoproteins have suggested that the protein may contribute to viral propagation at various stages in the replication cycle, including transcription, translation, processing of late viral proteins, assembly of virions, and viral propagation.\n Previous studies from our and other laboratories have indicated that JCV agnoprotein plays an important, although as yet incompletely understood role in the propagation of JCV.\n Here, we demonstrate that agnoprotein possesses properties commonly associated with viroporins.\n Our findings demonstrate that: (i) A deletion mutant of agnoprotein is defective in virion release and viral propagation; (ii) Agnoprotein localizes to the ER early in infection, but is also found at the plasma membrane late in infection; (iii) Agnoprotein is an integral membrane protein and forms homo-oligomers; (iv) Agnoprotein enhances permeability of cells to the translation inhibitor hygromycin B; (v) Agnoprotein induces the influx of extracellular Ca2+; (vi) The basic residues at amino acid positions 8 and 9 of agnoprotein key are determinants of the viroporin activity.\n The viroporin-like properties of agnoprotein result in increased membrane permeability and alterations in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis leading to membrane dysfunction and enhancement of virus

intracellular levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyto) through a phospholipase C-independent pathway, which is required for virus replication and morphogenesis.\n However, the NSP4 domain and mechanism that increases [Ca2+]cyto are unknown.\n We identified an NSP4 domain (amino acids [aa] 47 to 90) that inserts into membranes and has structural characteristics of viroporins, a class of small hydrophobic viral proteins that disrupt membrane integrity and ion homeostasis to facilitate virus entry, assembly, or release.\n Mutational analysis showed that NSP4 viroporin activity was mediated by an amphipathic ?-helical domain downstream of a conserved lysine cluster.\n The lysine cluster directed integral membrane insertion of the viroporin domain and was critical for viroporin activity.\n In epithelial cells, expression of wild-type NSP4 increased the levels of free cytoplasmic Ca2+ by 3.7-fold, but NSP4 viroporin mutants maintained low levels of [Ca2+]cyto, were retained in the ER, and failed to form cytoplasmic vesicular structures, called puncta, which surround viral replication and assembly sites in rotavirus-infected cells.\n When [Ca2+]cyto was increased pharmacologically with thapsigargin, viroporin mutants formed puncta, showing that elevation of calcium levels and puncta formation are distinct functions of NSP4 and indicating that NSP4 directly or indirectly responds to elevated cytoplasmic calcium levels.\n NSP4 viroporin activity establishes the mechanism for NSP4-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]cyto, a critical event that regulates rotavirus

viroporin that regulates viral production<","abstract":"In addition to a set of canonical genes, coronaviruses encode additional accessory proteins.\n A locus located between the spike and envelope genes is conserved in all coronaviruses and contains a complete or truncated open reading frame (ORF).\n Previously, we demonstrated that this locus, which contains the gene for accessory protein 3a from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), encodes a protein that forms ion channels and regulates virus release.\n In the current study, we explored whether the ORF4a protein of HCoV-229E has similar functions.\n Our findings revealed that the ORF4a proteins were expressed in infected cells and localized at the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC).\n The ORF4a proteins formed homo-oligomers through disulfide bridges and possessed ion channel activity in both Xenopus oocytes and yeast.\n Based on the measurement of conductance to different monovalent cations, the ORF4a was suggested to form a non-selective channel for monovalent cations, although Li+ partially reduced the inward current.\n Furthermore, viral production decreased when the ORF4a protein expression was suppressed by siRNA in infected cells.\n Collectively, this evidence indicates that the HCoV-229E ORF4a protein is functionally analogous to the SARS-CoV 3a protein, which also acts as a viroporin that regulates virus production.\n This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Viral Membrane Proteins — Channels for Cellular

stapled peptides target both HIV-1 entry and assembly","abstract":"Background\nPreviously, we reported the conversion of the 12-mer linear and cell-impermeable peptide CAI to a cell-penetrating peptide NYAD-1 by using an i,i?+?4 hydrocarbon stapling technique and confirmed its binding to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the HIV-1 capsid (CA) protein with an improved affinity (Kd?~?1 ?M) compared to CAI (Kd?~?15 ?M).\n\n NYAD-1 disrupts the formation of both immature- and mature-like virus particles in in vitro and cell-based assembly assays.\n\n In addition, it displays potent anti-HIV-1 activity in cell culture against a range of laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 isolates.\n\n\nResults\nIn this report, we expanded the study to i,i?+?7 hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to delineate their mechanism of action and antiviral activity.\n\n We identified three potent inhibitors, NYAD-36, -66 and -67, which showed strong binding to CA in NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies and disrupted the formation of mature-like particles.\n\n They showed typical ?-helical structures and penetrated cells; however, the cell penetration was not as efficient as observed with the i,i?+?4 peptides.\n\n Unlike NYAD-1, the i,i?+?7 peptides did not have any effect on virus release; however, they impaired Gag precursor processing.\n\n HIV-1 particles produced in the presence of these peptides displayed impaired infectivity.\n\n Consistent with an effect on virus entry, selection for viral resistance led to the emergence of two mutations in the gp120 subunit of the viral envelope (Env) glycoprotein, V120Q and A327P, located in the conserved region 1 (C1) and the base of the V3 loop, respectively.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe i,i?+?7 stapled peptides derived from CAI unexpectedly target both CA and the V3 loop of gp120. This dual-targeted activity is dependent on their ability to penetrate cells as well as their net charge.\n\n This mechanistic revelation will be useful in further modifying these peptides as potent anti-HIV-1 agents.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3842668","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hongtao","surname":"Zhang","email":"hzhang@nybloodcenter.org","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francesca","surname":"Curreli","email":"fcurreli@nybloodcenter.org","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abdul

through interactions with the autophagy regulatory factor Beclin 1, thus protecting HIV from degradation.\n The dual interaction of HIV with the autophagy pathway enhances viral yields by using the early stages while inhibiting the late stages of autophagy.\n The role of Nef in the latter process enhances yields of infectious HIV and may be of significance for progression to clinical

However, little is known about the regulatory role of autophagy in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) replication.\n In this study, we found that TGEV infection increased the number of autophagosome-like double- and single-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of host cells, a phenomenon that is known to be related to autophagy.\n In addition, virus replication was required for the

autophagy was pharmacologically inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002, TGEV replication increased.\n The increase in virus yield via autophagy inhibition was further confirmed by the use of siRNA duplexes, through which three proteins required for autophagy were depleted.\n Furthermore, TGEV replication was inhibited when autophagy was activated by rapamycin.\n The antiviral response of autophagy was confirmed by using siRNA to reduce the expression of gene p300, which otherwise inhibits autophagy.\n Together, the results indicate that TGEV infection activates autophagy and that

that the protein possesses a number of features typical of a viroporin when it is overexpressed in bacterial and mammalian cells as well as in FMDV-infected cells.\n The protein was found to be mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with both the N- and C-terminal domains stretched into the cytosol.\n It exhibited cytotoxicity in Escherichia coli, which attenuated 2B protein

several processes, including virus replication and pathogenesis.\n While many coronaviruses (CoVs) encode two viroporins, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) encodes three: proteins 3a, E, and 8a.\n Additionally, proteins 3a and E have a PDZ-binding motif (PBM), which can potentially bind over 400 cellular proteins which contain a PDZ domain, making them potentially important for the control of cell function.\n In the present work, a comparative study of the functional motifs included within the SARS-CoV viroporins was performed, mostly focusing on the roles of the IC and PBM of E and 3a proteins.\n Our results showed that the full-length E and 3a proteins were required for maximal SARS-CoV replication and virulence, whereas viroporin 8a had only a minor impact on these activities.\n A virus missing both the E and 3a proteins was not viable, whereas the presence of either protein with a functional PBM restored virus viability.\n E protein IC activity and the presence of its PBM were necessary for virulence in mice.\n In contrast, the presence or absence of the homologous motifs in protein 3a did not influence virus pathogenicity.\n Therefore, dominance of the IC

NLRP3 Inflammasome","abstract":"Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) regulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1?) and IL-18. We previously showed that influenza virus M2 or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 2B proteins stimulate IL-1? secretion following activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n However, the mechanism by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unknown.\n Here, we provide direct evidence that SARS-CoV 3a protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages.\n SARS-CoV 3a was sufficient to cause the NLRP3 inflammasome activation.\n The ion channel activity of the 3a protein was essential for 3a-mediated IL-1? secretion.\n While cells uninfected or infected with a lentivirus expressing a 3a protein defective in ion channel activity expressed NLRP3 uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, NLRP3 was redistributed to the perinuclear space in cells infected with a lentivirus expressing the 3a protein.\n K+ efflux and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were important for SARS-CoV 3a-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation.\n These results highlight the importance of viroporins, transmembrane pore-forming viral proteins, in virus-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation.\n","id":"PMC6361828","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"I-Yin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Miyu","surname":"Moriyama","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming-Fu","surname":"Chang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Takeshi","surname":"Ichinohe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel 2019 coronavirus genome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS and MERS: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiology and cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong, People's Republic of China, in February, 2003","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Molecular epidemiology of the novel coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Identification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WHO.

coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China.\n The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak.\n The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV.\n Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus.\n Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV.\n In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients.\n Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)—as SARS-CoV.\n","id":"PMC7095418","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xian-Guang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hao-Rui","surname":"Si","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao-Lin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui-Dong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ren-Di","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Qin","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kai","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Quan-Jiao","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Lin","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bing","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Xian","surname":"Zhan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Yi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geng-Fu","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"zlshi@wh.iov.cn","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team, Li Q.
