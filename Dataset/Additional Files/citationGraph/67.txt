disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David

13.0), feverishness and/or triage temperature ?37.2 °C (OR 3.0, 95 % CI 2.0, 4.7), 2–5 days from symptom onset to the emergency department visit (OR 2.2, 95 % CI 1.5, 3.2), and wheezing (OR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.3, 3.3).\n\n The effect of cough on influenza increased with older age.\n\n Epidemiological factors associated with increased odds for influenza included weeks when ?10 % influenza tests from provincial laboratories were positive (OR 5.1, 95 % CI 1.2, 21.7) and exposure to a person with influenza-like illness (OR 1.9, 95 % CI 1.3, 2.8).\n\n Among participants with influenza, only 47 (31 %) met the U.\n\nS.\n\n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for influenza-like illness (temperature ?37.8 °C and cough and/or sore throat).\n\n\nConclusions\nAs in younger adults, cough and feverishness are the two symptoms most predictive of influenza in the elderly.\n\n Current influenza-like illness definitions did not adequately capture influenza in older adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5084347","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Po-Po","surname":"Lam","email":"popo.lam@utoronto.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Brenda

Factors for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Homeless Shelters in Chicago, Illinois—March–May, 2020","abstract":"Background\nPeople experiencing homelessness are at increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but little is known about specific risk factors for infection within homeless shelters.\n\n \nMethods\nWe performed widespread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction testing and collected risk factor information at all homeless shelters in Chicago with at least 1 reported case of COVID-19 (n = 21).\n\n Multivariable, mixed-effects log-binomial models were built to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for SARS-CoV-2 infection for both individual- and facility-level risk factors.\n\n \nResults\nDuring March 1 to May 1, 2020, 1717 shelter residents and staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 472 (27%) persons tested positive.\n\n Prevalence of infection was higher for residents (431 of 1435, 30%) than for staff (41 of 282, 15%) (prevalence ratio = 2.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.78–3.58).\n\n The majority of residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection (293 of 406 with available information about symptoms, 72%) reported no symptoms at the time of specimen collection or within the following 2 weeks.\n\n Among residents, sharing a room with a large number of people was associated with increased likelihood of infection (aPR for sharing with &gt;20 people compared with single rooms = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11–2.80), and current smoking was associated with reduced likelihood of infection (aPR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60–0.85).\n\n At the facility level, a higher proportion of residents leaving and returning each day was associated with increased prevalence (aPR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.16), whereas an increase in the number of private bathrooms was associated with reduced prevalence (aPR for 1 additional private bathroom per 100 people = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87–0.98).\n\n \nConclusions\nWe identified a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in homeless shelters.\n\n Reducing the number of residents sharing dormitories might reduce the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n When community transmission is high, limiting movement of persons experiencing homelessness into and out of shelters might also be beneficial.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7665740","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Isaac","surname":"Ghinai","email":"isaac.ghinai@cityofchicago.org","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

in older adults in the United States: A systematic review","abstract":"Objective\nThis review was undertaken to assess the historical evidence of the disease incidence and burden of laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in medically attended older adults.\n\n\nDesign\nA qualitative systematic literature review was performed; no statistical synthesis of the data was planned, in anticipation of expected heterogeneity across studies in this population.\n\n\nMethods\nA literature search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted for studies of medically attended RSV in older adults (? 50 years) published in the last 15 years.\n\n Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\n\nResults\nFrom 10 studies reporting incidence proportions, RSV may be the causative agent in up to 12% of medically attended acute respiratory illness in older adults unselected for comorbidities, with variations in clinical setting and by year.\n\n In multiple studies, medically attended–RSV incidence among older adults not selected for having underlying health conditions increased with increasing age.\n\n Of prospectively followed lung transplant recipients, 16% tested positive for RSV.\n\n In hospitalized adults with chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, 8% to 13% were infected with RSV during winter seasons (8%-13%) or metapneumovirus season (8%).\n\n Hospitalizations for RSV in older adults typically lasted 3 to 6 days, with substantial proportions requiring intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation.\n\n Among older adults hospitalized with RSV, the mortality rate was 6% to 8%.\n\n\nConclusions\nProtection of older adults against RSV could reduce respiratory-related burden, especially as age increases and the prevalence of comorbidities (especially cardiopulmonary comorbidities) grows.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5552193","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ann

Each patient had at least 14 days of follow-up.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 24 patients with confirmed Covid-19. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64±18 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7±4 days before admission.\n\n The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus.\n\n All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; 75% (18 patients) needed mechanical ventilation.\n\n Most of the patients (17) also had hypotension and needed vasopressors.\n\n No patient tested positive for influenza A, influenza B, or other respiratory viruses.\n\n Half the patients (12) died between ICU day 1 and day 18, including 4 patients who had a do-not-resuscitate order on admission.\n\n Of the 12 surviving patients, 5 were discharged home, 4 were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, and 3 continued to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both.\n\n Mortality among these critically ill patients was high.\n\n (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7143164","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pavan K.","surname":"Bhatraju","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bijan J.","surname":"Ghassemieh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"Nichols","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Keith R.","surname":"Jerome","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Arun K.","surname":"Nalla","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexander L.","surname":"Greninger","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sudhakar","surname":"Pipavath","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark M.","surname":"Wurfel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Evans","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patricia A.","surname":"Kritek","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"T.

Among 76 residents who participated in point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) tested positive.\n\n Of these 48 residents, 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days).\n\n Samples from these 24 presymptomatic residents had a median rRT-PCR cycle threshold value of 23.1, and viable virus was recovered from 17 residents.\n\n As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%).\n\n Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide.\n\n\nConclusions\nRapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility.\n\n More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission.\n\n Infection-control strategies focused solely on symptomatic residents were not sufficient to prevent transmission after SARS-CoV-2 introduction into this facility.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7200056","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Melissa M.","surname":"Arons","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelly

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization.\n\n The patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184444","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pingzheng","surname":"Mo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuanyuan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liping","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qiu","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongling","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shicheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mingqi","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tielong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shihui","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruiying","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qian","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wang","email":"fanndywang@foxmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongxi","surname":"Zhang","email":"znact1936@126.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmj.m1091","date":"2020-03-17","title":"Clinical

diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed.\n\n Data were collected until 28 February 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)).\n\n The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days.\n\n Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%)

20 and February 22, 2020, were enrolled and their clinical data were retrospectively collected.\n\n Multivariate COX regression was used to identify the risk factors associated with progression, and

into stable group (n=168, 80.8%) and progressive group (n=40,19.2%) based on whether their conditions worsened during the hospitalization Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that comorbidity, older age, lower lymphocyte and higher lactate dehydrogenase at presentation were independent high-risk factors for COVID-19 progression.\n\n Incorporating these 4 factors, the nomogram achieved good

with the development of COPD.\n\n Until now, it is unclear whether CAP in COPD is due to smoking-related effects, or due to COPD pathophysiology itself.\n\n\nObjective\nTo evaluate the association between COPD and CAP by smoking status.\n\n\nMethods\nIn total, 62,621 COPD and 191,654 control subjects, matched by year of birth, gender and primary care practice, were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (2005–2014).\n\n Incidence rates (IRs) were estimated by dividing the total number of CAP cases by the cumulative person-time at risk.\n\n Time-varying Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for CAP in COPD patients versus controls.\n\n HRs of CAP by smoking status were calculated by stratified analyses in COPD patients versus controls and within both subgroups with never smoking as reference.\n\n\nResults\nIRs of CAP in COPD patients (32.00/1,000 person-years) and controls (6.75/1,000 person-years) increased with age and female gender.\n\n The risk of CAP in COPD patients was higher than in controls (HR 4.51, 95% CI: 4.27–4.77).\n\n Current smoking COPD patients had comparable CAP risk (HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.82–1.02) as

factors","abstract":"Background\nIn Japan and other societies with rapidly aging populations, recurrent pneumonia (RP) is a major clinical problem yet only limited information exists regarding the burden of this disease.\n\n\nMethods\nA prospective study of adult pneumonia was conducted to investigate the incidence of RP and potential risk factors.\n\n From February 1, 2012 to January 31, 2013, patients aged???15 years who were diagnosed with pneumonia were prospectively enrolled in a representative community hospital located in central Japan.\n\n Patients were followed for one-year to evaluate the recurrence of pneumonia and characteristics associated with RP.\n\n Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to compute adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and ascertain risk factors significantly associated with RP.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 841 patients with a median age of 73 years (range 15–101 years) were enrolled totaling 1,048 person-years of observation with a median follow-up time of 475 days.\n\n A total of 137 patients had at least one recurrent episode with an incidence rate of 13.1 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval: 11.1–15.5).\n\n In multivariate analysis, a past history of pneumonia (aHR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.35–2.8), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 1.86, 1.24–2.78) and inhaled corticosteroid usage (aHR 1.78, 1.12–2.84) and hypnotic/sedative medication usage (aHR 2.06, 1.28–3.31) were identified as independent risk factors for recurrent pneumonia, whereas angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors usage was associated with a reduction of the risk of RP (aHR 0.22, 0.05–0.91).\n\n The detection of P.\n\n aeruginosa was significantly associated with RP even after adjusting for chronic pulmonary diseases (aHR?=?2.37).\n\n\nConclusions\nRecurrent pneumonia constitutes a considerable proportion of the pneumonia burden in Japan.\n\n A past history of pneumonia, chronic pulmonary disease, inhaled corticosteroid and hypnotic/sedative medication usage and detection of P.\n\n aeruginosa were identified as independent risk factors for recurrent pneumonia and special attention regarding the use of medications in this vulnerable population is needed to reduce the impact of this disease in aging populations.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

Governments worldwide now face the common challenge of easing lockdowns and restrictions while balancing various health, social, and economic concerns.\n\n To facilitate cross-country learning, this Health Policy paper uses an adapted framework to examine the approaches taken by nine high-income countries and regions that have started to ease COVID-19 restrictions: five in the Asia Pacific region (ie, Hong Kong [Special Administrative Region], Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea) and four in Europe (ie, Germany, Norway, Spain, and the UK).\n\n This comparative analysis presents important lessons to be learnt from the experiences of these countries and regions.\n\n Although the future of the virus is unknown at present, countries should continue to share their experiences, shield populations who are at risk, and suppress transmission to save

Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Data suggest nCoV more infectious than 1918 flu, but what does that mean?

epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

and mortality of healthcare workers worldwide from COVID-19: a systematic review","abstract":"Objectives\nTo estimate COVID-19 infections and deaths in healthcare workers (HCWs) from a global perspective during the early phases of the pandemic.\n\n\nDesign\nSystematic review.\n\n\nMethods\nTwo parallel searches of academic bibliographic databases and grey literature were undertaken until 8 May 2020. Governments were also contacted for further information where possible.\n\n There were no restrictions on language, information sources used, publication status and types of sources of evidence.\n\n The AACODS checklist or the National Institutes of Health study quality assessment tools were used to appraise each source of evidence.\n\n\nOutcome measures\nPublication characteristics, country-specific data points, COVID-19-specific data, demographics of affected HCWs and public health measures employed.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 152?888 infections and 1413 deaths were reported.\n\n Infections were mainly in women (71.6%, n=14?058) and nurses (38.6%, n=10?706), but deaths were mainly in men (70.8%, n=550) and doctors (51.4%, n=525).\n\n Limited data suggested that general practitioners and mental health nurses were the highest risk specialities for deaths.\n\n There were 37.2 deaths reported per 100 infections for HCWs aged over 70 years.\n\n Europe had the highest absolute numbers of reported infections (119 628) and deaths (712), but the Eastern Mediterranean region had the highest number of reported deaths per 100 infections (5.7).\n\n\nConclusions\nCOVID-19 infections and deaths among HCWs follow that of the general population around the world.\n\n The reasons for gender and specialty differences require further exploration, as do the low rates reported in Africa and India.\n\n Although physicians working in certain specialities may be considered high risk due to exposure to oronasal secretions, the risk to other specialities must not be underestimated.\n\n Elderly HCWs may require assigning to less risky settings such as telemedicine or administrative positions.\n\n Our pragmatic approach provides general trends, and highlights the need for universal guidelines for testing and reporting of infections in HCWs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7722361","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Soham","surname":"Bandyopadhyay","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ronnie

the COVID-19 Pandemic Response in Brazil and Mexico","abstract":"We present a new concept, Punt Politics, and apply it to the COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) in two epicenters of the pandemic: Mexico and Brazil.\n Punt Politics refers to national leaders in federal systems deferring or deflecting responsibility for health systems decision-making to sub-national entities without evidence or coordination.\n The fragmentation of authority and overlapping functions in federal, decentralized political systems make them more susceptible to coordination problems than centralized, unitary systems.\n We apply the concept to pandemics, which require national health system stewardship, using sub-national NPI data that we developed and curated through the Observatory for the Containment of COVID-19 in the Americas to illustrate Punt Politics in Mexico and Brazil.\n Both countries suffer from protracted, high levels of COVID-19 mortality and inadequate pandemic responses, including little testing and disregard for scientific evidence.\n We illustrate how populist leadership drove Punt Politics and how partisan politics contributed to disabling an evidence-based response in Mexico and Brazil.\n These cases illustrate the combination of decentralization and populist leadership that is most conducive to punting responsibility.\n We discuss how Punt Politics reduces health system functionality, providing lessons for other countries and future pandemic responses, including vaccine rollout.\n","id":"PMC8514423","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Felicia

health-system preparedness and response to COVID-19 in Brazil: a comprehensive analysis","abstract":"Background\nCOVID-19 spread rapidly in Brazil despite the country's well established health and social protection systems.\n\n Understanding the relationships between health-system preparedness, responses to COVID-19, and the pattern of spread of the epidemic is particularly important in a country marked by wide inequalities in socioeconomic characteristics (eg, housing and employment status) and other health risks (age structure and burden of chronic disease).\n\n\nMethods\nFrom several publicly available sources in Brazil, we obtained data on health risk factors for severe COVID-19 (proportion of the population with chronic disease and proportion aged ?60 years), socioeconomic vulnerability (proportions of the population with housing vulnerability or without formal work), health-system capacity (numbers of intensive care unit beds and physicians), coverage of health and social assistance, deaths from COVID-19, and state-level responses of government in terms of physical distancing policies.\n\n We also obtained data on the proportion of the population staying at home, based on locational data, as a measure of physical distancing adherence.\n\n We developed a socioeconomic vulnerability index (SVI) based on household characteristics and the Human Development Index.\n\n Data were analysed at the state and municipal levels.\n\n Descriptive statistics and correlations between state-level indicators were used to characterise the relationship between the availability of health-care resources and socioeconomic characteristics and the spread of the epidemic and the response of governments and populations in terms of new investments, legislation, and physical distancing.\n\n We used linear regressions on a municipality-by-month dataset from February to October, 2020, to characterise the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths and response to the epidemic across municipalities.\n\n\nFindings\nThe initial spread of COVID-19 was mostly affected by patterns of socioeconomic vulnerability as measured by the SVI rather than population age structure and prevalence of health risk factors.\n\n The states with a high (greater than median) SVI were able to expand hospital capacity, to enact stringent COVID-19-related legislation, and to increase physical distancing adherence in the population, although not sufficiently to prevent higher COVID-19 mortality during the initial phase of the epidemic compared with states with a low SVI.\n\n Death rates accelerated until June, 2020, particularly in municipalities with the highest socioeconomic vulnerability.\n\n Throughout the following months, however, differences in policy response converged in municipalities with lower and higher SVIs, while physical distancing remained relatively higher and death rates became relatively lower in the municipalities with the highest SVIs compared with those with lower SVIs.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn Brazil, existing socioeconomic inequalities, rather than age, health status, and other risk factors for COVID-19, have affected the course of the epidemic, with a disproportionate adverse burden on states and municipalities with high socioeconomic vulnerability.\n\n Local government responses and population behaviour in the states and municipalities with higher socioeconomic vulnerability have helped to contain the effects of the epidemic.\n\n Targeted policies and actions are needed to protect those with the greatest socioeconomic vulnerability.\n\n This experience could be relevant in other low-income and middle-income countries where socioeconomic vulnerability varies greatly.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\nTranslation\nFor the Portuguese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials

effectiveness.\n\n\nResults\nEffective strategies reflect factors such as speed of governmental intervention, cultural norms, population demographics and available resources.\n\n While biases,

have raised great public health concern globally.\n\n Here, we report a novel bat-origin CoV causing severe and fatal pneumonia in humans.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical data and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Hubei province, China.\n\n Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing.\n\n Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed.\n\n\nResults\nFive patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation.\n\n One of these patients died.\n\n Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown ?-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates.\n\n These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843).\n\n The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade.\n\n Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs.\n\n However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor.\n\n\nConclusion\nA novel bat-borne CoV was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147275","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Li-Li","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ye-Ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Qiang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zi-Chun","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Teng","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhong","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Jun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Wang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guo-Hui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Ying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiu-Yang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin-Ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-Wei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao-Lin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Ping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhen-Shun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Lin","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Hui","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuan","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Wei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Yuan","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Yuan","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pei-Fang","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001191","date":"1970-01-01","title":"First

lists of identified articles, hand searches of key journals and additional papers from the authors' collections.\n\n\nStudy selection\nStudies were included if they reported on a seasonal or pandemic influenza outbreak coinciding with a planned or unplanned school closure.\n\n\nResults\nOf 2579 papers identified through MEDLINE and EMBASE, 65 were eligible for inclusion in the review along with 14 identified from other sources.\n\n Influenza incidence frequently declined after school closure.\n\n The effect was sometimes reversed when schools reopened, supporting a causal role for school closure in reducing incidence.\n\n Any benefits associated with school closure appeared to be greatest among school-aged children.\n\n However, as schools often closed late in the outbreak or other interventions were used concurrently, it was sometimes unclear how much school closure contributed to the reductions in incidence.\n\n\nConclusions\nSchool closures appear to have the potential to reduce influenza transmission, but the heterogeneity in the data available means that the optimum strategy (eg, the ideal length and timing of closure) remains unclear.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3586057","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Charlotte","surname":"Jackson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emilia","surname":"Vynnycky","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jeremy","surname":"Hawker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Babatunde","surname":"Olowokure","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Punam","surname":"Mangtani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/1471-2334-11-257","date":"2011-09-30","title":"Recommendations for and compliance with social restrictions during implementation of school closures in the early phase of the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 outbreak in Melbourne, Australia","abstract":"Background\nLocalized reactive school and classroom closures were implemented as part of a suite of pandemic containment measures during the initial response to influenza A (H1N1) 2009 in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n Infected individuals, and those who had been in close contact with a case, were asked to stay in voluntary home quarantine and refrain from contact with visitors for seven days from the date of symptom onset or exposure to an infected person.\n\n Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) was available for treatment or prophylaxis.\n\n\nMethods\nWe surveyed affected families through schools involved in the closures.\n\n Analyses of responses were descriptive.\n\n We characterized recommendations made to case and contact households and quantified adherence to guidelines and antiviral therapy.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 314 respondent households, 51 contained a confirmed case.\n\n The prescribed quarantine period ranged from 1-14 days, reflecting logistic difficulties in reactive implementation relative to the stated guidelines.\n\n Household-level compliance with the requirement to stay at home was high (84.5%, 95% CI 79.3,88.5) and contact with children outside the immediate family infrequent.\n\n\nConclusions\nLevels of compliance with recommendations in our sample were high compared with other studies, likely due to heightened public awareness of a newly introduced virus of uncertain severity.\n\n The variability of reported recommendations highlighted the difficulties inherent in implementing a targeted reactive strategy, such as that employed in Melbourne, on a large scale during a public health emergency.\n\n This study emphasizes the need to understand how public health measures are implemented when seeking to evaluate their effectiveness.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3190378","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jodie","surname":"McVernon","email":"j.mcvernon@unimelb.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kate","surname":"Mason","email":"kmason@unimelb.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sylvia","surname":"Petrony","email":"spetrony@unimelb.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paula","surname":"Nathan","email":"pmnathan@unimelb.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anthony

of Dengue Illness and the Cost-Effectiveness of Future Vaccination Programs in Singapore","abstract":"Background\nDengue illness causes 50–100 million infections worldwide and threatens 2.5 billion people in the tropical and subtropical regions.\n\n Little is known about the disease burden and economic impact of dengue in higher resourced countries or the cost-effectiveness of potential dengue vaccines in such settings.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nWe estimate the direct and indirect costs of dengue from hospitalized and ambulatory cases in Singapore.\n\n We consider inter alia the impacts of dengue on the economy using the human-capital and the friction cost methods.\n\n Disease burden was estimated using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and the cost-effectiveness of a potential vaccine program was evaluated.\n\n The average economic impact of dengue illness in Singapore from 2000 to 2009 in constant 2010 US$ ranged between $0.85 billion and $1.15 billion, of which control costs constitute 42%–59%.\n\n Using empirically derived disability weights, we estimated an annual average disease burden of 9–14 DALYs per 100 000 habitants, making it comparable to diseases such as hepatitis B or syphilis.\n\n The proportion of symptomatic dengue cases detected by the national surveillance system was estimated to be low, and to decrease with age.\n\n Under population projections by the United Nations, the price per dose threshold for which vaccines stop being more cost-effective than the current vector control program ranged from $50 for mass vaccination requiring 3 doses and only conferring 10 years of immunity to $300 for vaccination requiring 2 doses and conferring lifetime immunity.\n\n The thresholds for these vaccine programs to not be cost-effective for Singapore were $100 and $500 per dose respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nDengue illness presents a serious economic and disease burden in Singapore.\n\n Dengue vaccines are expected to be cost-effective if reasonably low prices are adopted and will help to reduce the economic and disease burden of dengue in Singapore substantially.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3243704","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Luis R.","surname":"Carrasco","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Linda

State of Vaccine Confidence 2016: Global Insights Through a 67-Country Survey","abstract":"Background\nPublic trust in immunization is an increasingly important global health issue.\n\n Losses in confidence in vaccines and immunization programmes can lead to vaccine reluctance and refusal, risking disease outbreaks and challenging immunization goals in high- and low-income settings.\n\n National and international immunization stakeholders have called for better monitoring of vaccine confidence to identify emerging concerns before they evolve into vaccine confidence crises.\n\n\nMethods\nWe perform a large-scale, data-driven study on worldwide attitudes to immunizations.\n\n This survey – which we believe represents the largest survey on confidence in immunization to date – examines perceptions of vaccine importance, safety, effectiveness, and religious compatibility among 65,819 individuals across 67 countries.\n\n Hierarchical models are employed to probe relationships between individual- and country-level socio-economic factors and vaccine attitudes obtained through the four-question, Likert-scale survey.\n\n\nFindings\nOverall sentiment towards vaccinations is positive across all 67 countries, however there is wide variability between countries and across world regions.\n\n Vaccine-safety related sentiment is particularly negative in the European region, which has seven of the ten least confident countries, with 41% of respondents in France and 36% of respondents in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina reporting that they disagree that vaccines are safe (compared to a global average of 13%).\n\n The oldest age group (65+) and Roman Catholics (amongst all faiths surveyed) are associated with positive views on vaccine sentiment, while the Western Pacific region reported the highest level of religious incompatibility with vaccines.\n\n Countries with high levels of schooling and good access to health services are associated with lower rates of positive sentiment, pointing to an emerging inverse relationship between vaccine sentiments and socio-economic status.\n\n\nConclusions\nRegular monitoring of vaccine attitudes – coupled with monitoring of local immunization rates – at the national and sub-national levels can identify populations with declining confidence and acceptance.\n\n These populations should be prioritized to further investigate the drivers of negative sentiment and to inform appropriate interventions to prevent adverse public health outcomes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5078590","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Heidi

Mexico rapidly evolved into a pandemic.\n\n The swine flu outbreak was the first pandemic in more than 40 years and for many, their first encounter with a major influenza outbreak.\n\n This study examines public understandings of the pandemic, exploring how people deciphered the threat and perceived they could control the risks.\n\n\nMethods\nPurposive sampling was used to recruit seventy three people (61 women and 12 men) to take part in 14 focus group discussions around the time of the second wave in swine flu cases.\n\n\nResults\nThese discussions showed that there was little evidence of the public over-reacting, that people believed the threat of contracting swine flu was inevitable, and that they assessed their own self-efficacy for protecting against it to be low.\n\n Respondents assessed a greater risk to their health from the vaccine than from the disease.\n\n Such findings could have led to apathy about following the UK Governments recommended health protective behaviours, and a sub-optimal level of vaccine uptake.\n\n More generally, people were confused about the difference between seasonal influenza and swine flu and their vaccines.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis research suggests a gap in public understandings which could hinder attempts to communicate about novel flu viruses in the future.\n\n There was general support for the government's handling of the pandemic, although its public awareness campaign was deemed ineffectual as few people changed their current hand hygiene practices.\n\n There was less support for the media who were deemed to have over-reported the swine flu

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

Influenza Disease Burden from Population-Based Surveillance Data in the United States","abstract":"Annual estimates of the influenza disease burden provide information to evaluate programs and allocate resources.\n We used a multiplier method with routine population-based surveillance data on influenza hospitalization in the United States to correct for under-reporting and estimate the burden of influenza for seasons after the 2009 pandemic.\n Five sites of the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) collected data on the frequency and sensitivity of influenza testing during two seasons to estimate under-detection.\n Population-based rates of influenza-associated hospitalization and Intensive Care Unit admission from 2010–2013 were extrapolated to the U.\nS.\n population from FluSurv-NET and corrected for under-detection.\n Influenza deaths were calculated using a ratio of deaths to hospitalizations.\n We estimated that influenza-related hospitalizations were under-detected during 2010-11 by a factor of 2.1 (95%CI 1.7–2.9) for age &lt; 18 years, 3.1 (2.4–4.5) for ages 18-64 years, and 5.2 (95%CI 3.8–8.3) for age 65+.\n Results were similar in 2011-12. Extrapolated estimates for 3 seasons from 2010–2013 included: 114,192–624,435 hospitalizations, 18,491–95,390 ICU admissions, and 4,915–27,174 deaths per year; 54–70% of hospitalizations and 71–85% of deaths occurred among adults aged 65+.\n Influenza causes a substantial disease burden in the U.\nS.\n that varies by age and season.\n Periodic estimation of multipliers across multiple sites and age groups improves our understanding of influenza detection in sentinel surveillance systems.\n Adjusting surveillance data using a multiplier method is a relatively simple means to estimate the impact of influenza and the subsequent value of interventions to prevent influenza.\n","id":"PMC4349859","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carrie","surname":"Reed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sandra S.","surname":"Chaves","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pam","surname":"Daily Kirley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruth","surname":"Emerson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Deborah","surname":"Aragon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emily B.","surname":"Hancock","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lisa","surname":"Butler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joan","surname":"Baumbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gary","surname":"Hollick","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy M.","surname":"Bennett","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew R.","surname":"Laidler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ann","surname":"Thomas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Martin I.","surname":"Meltzer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lyn","surname":"Finelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.15585/mmwr.mm6917e1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Prevalence in Homeless Shelters — Four U.S. Cities, March 27–April 15, 2020","abstract":"","id":"PMC7206983","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emily","surname":"Mosites","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Erin M.","surname":"Parker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kristie E.

health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region.\n\n\nMethods\nAfter identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility.\n\n Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented.\n\n Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively.\n\n The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101).\n\n As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7121761","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Temet M.","surname":"McMichael","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dustin

aimed to identify clinical characteristics and epidemiological factors associated with influenza among community-dwelling adults aged ?60 years presenting to emergency departments.\n\n\nMethods\nWe identified patients with influenza-compatible chief complaints presenting to emergency departments of six acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 influenza seasons.\n\n Clinical characteristics, medical history and demographics were collected by patient interview, chart review and by contacting vaccine providers.\n\n Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza using polymerase chain reaction.\n\n We modeled predictors of influenza using multivariable logistic regression models that compared individuals with and without influenza.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1318 participants, 151 (11 %) had influenza (98 A/H3N2, 12 A/H1N1, 4 A [not sub-typed], 37 B).\n\n In the multivariable model, clinical symptoms associated with influenza were cough (OR 6.4, 95 % CI 3.2, 13.0), feverishness and/or triage temperature ?37.2 °C (OR 3.0, 95 % CI 2.0, 4.7), 2–5 days from symptom onset to the emergency department visit (OR 2.2, 95 % CI 1.5, 3.2), and wheezing (OR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.3, 3.3).\n\n The effect of cough on influenza increased with older age.\n\n Epidemiological factors associated with increased odds for influenza included weeks when ?10 % influenza tests from provincial laboratories were positive (OR 5.1, 95 % CI 1.2, 21.7) and exposure to a person with influenza-like illness (OR 1.9, 95 % CI 1.3, 2.8).\n\n Among participants with influenza, only 47 (31 %) met the U.\n\nS.\n\n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for influenza-like illness (temperature ?37.8 °C and cough and/or sore throat).\n\n\nConclusions\nAs in younger adults, cough and feverishness are the two symptoms most predictive of influenza in the elderly.\n\n Current influenza-like illness definitions did not adequately capture influenza in older adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5084347","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Po-Po","surname":"Lam","email":"popo.lam@utoronto.ca","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Brenda

and control practices will therefore remain of paramount importance if the impact of outbreaks is to be minimised.\n In this review, we discuss the nature of the problem of influenza in long?term care
