Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%);

be considered a real pathology.\n In the world wide, obesity represent one of the major public health issue associated with increased morbidity and mortality.\n Overweight or obesity, in fact, significantly increases the risk of contracting diseases, such as: arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, cerebral vasculopathy, gallbladder lithiasis, arthropathy, ovarian polycytosis, sleep apnea syndrome, and some neoplasms.\n Despite numerous informative campaigns, unfortunately, the fight against obesity does not seem to work: in the last years, the prevalence continued to increase.\n The progressive and rapid increase in the incidence of obesity, which has characterized most of the economically advanced countries in the last decade, has been the main stimulus for the research of the mechanisms underlying this pathology and the related disorders.\n The aims of this review is to provide a revision of the literature in order to define obesity as diseases, secondly to highlight the limits and the inaccuracy of common tools used for the diagnosis of obesity, and as a third thing to strengthen the concept of the complexity of obesity as a disease among political health care providers.\n Obesity may be viewed as a multifactorial pathology and chronic low-grade inflammatory disease.\n In fact, people affected by obesity have greater risk of developing comorbility and morbility, respect to healthy.\n Hence, the absolute therapeutic benefit is directly proportional to the basic risk.\n So, internationally interest on early diagnosis of obesity is growing to avoid under- and overdiagnosis consequences.\n Therefore, the consequences are an aggravation of the disease and an increase in obesity related pathology like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.\n The most widely used parameter for diagnosis, body mass index (BMI) is not suitable for assessing the body fat.\n In fact, several studies demonstrate that BMI alone cannot define obesity, which consists not so much in weight gain as in excess fat mass.\n The use of suitable tools for the assessment of fat mass percentage combined with clinical and genetic analysis allowed to identify different phenotypes of obesity, which explain the various paradoxes of obesity.\n It is essential to adopt all possible strategies to be able to combat obesity, ameliorate the suffering of patients, and reduce the social and treatment costs of obesity.\n","id":"PMC6530037","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Antonino","surname":"De

lessons to the next lethal viral epidemic that occurs.\n\n\nMethod\nThe 1995 Kikwit Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formally Zaire) is one of the most well studied epidemics to have occurred to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nWhen an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered.\n\n Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities.\n\n The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral lessons from the outbreak include the importance of having simple, well-defined triage procedures; staff who are flexible and able to adapt to situations with unknowns; and the need to protect staff physically and emotionally to ensure a sustained effort to provide

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive

organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages.\n Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses “before” and “during” confinement conditions.\n Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis.\n The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall).\n Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day.\n Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly.\n Conclusion: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction.\n A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.\n","id":"PMC7352706","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Achraf","surname":"Ammar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Khaled","surname":"Trabelsi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hamdi","surname":"Chtourou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Boukhris","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liwa","surname":"Masmoudi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bassem","surname":"Bouaziz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ellen","surname":"Bentlage","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniella","surname":"How","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Notger","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Asma","surname":"Aloui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Hammouda","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laisa

knowledge and belief about COVID-19’s severity in Bangladesh predicted depressive symptoms.\n Thus, revealing that mental health issues were high and COVID-19 worry predicted psychopathology symptoms among Bangladeshi university students.\n Overall, these results, examining students’ mental health during COVID-19, in April 2020, can be helpful to compare how students have adjusted over the pandemic’s progression.\n","id":"PMC7781410","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rajib Ahmed","surname":"Faisal","email":"faisal.ier@cu.ac.bd","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mary C.","surname":"Jobe","email":"mary.jobe.16@cnu.edu","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Mary C.","surname":"Jobe","email":"mary.jobe.16@cnu.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Oli","surname":"Ahmed","email":"oliahmed_polash131@cu.ac.bd","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Oli","surname":"Ahmed","email":"oliahmed_polash131@cu.ac.bd","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tanima","surname":"Sharker","email":"tanima.bmb@nstu.edu.bd","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tanima","surname":"Sharker","email":"tanima.bmb@nstu.edu.bd","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.25591","date":"2020-09-17","title":"Factors Associated With Mental Health Disorders Among University Students in France Confined During the COVID-19 Pandemic","abstract":"Question\nWhat is the mental health state of university students in France who were confined during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and what factors are associated with the development of mental health symptoms?\nFindings\nThis survey study of 69?054 students who experienced quarantine found high prevalence rates of severe self-reported mental health symptoms.\n\n Among risk factors identified, female or nonbinary gender, problems with income or housing, history of psychiatric follow-up, symptoms compatible with COVID-19, social isolation, and low quality of information received were associated with altered mental health.\n\n\nMeaning\nThe findings of this study suggest that students’ mental health is a public health issue that has become even more critical in the context of a pandemic, underlining the need to reinforce prevention, surveillance, and access to care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7584927","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marielle","surname":"Wathelet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stéphane","surname":"Duhem","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guillaume","surname":"Vaiva","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thierry","surname":"Baubet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Enguerrand","surname":"Habran","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emilie","surname":"Veerapa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Debien","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sylvie","surname":"Molenda","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mathilde","surname":"Horn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Grandgenèvre","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charles-Edouard","surname":"Notredame","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fabien","surname":"D’Hondt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113108","date":"2020-05-16","title":"Psychological effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown among students and workers of a Spanish university","abstract":"The aim of this study was to analyze the psychological impact of COVID-19 in the university community during the first weeks of confinement.\n A cross-sectional study was conducted.\n The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was employed to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress.\n The emotional impact of the situation was analyzed using the Impact of Event Scale.\n An online survey was fulfilled by 2530 members of the University of Valladolid, in Spain.\n Moderate to extremely severe scores of anxiety, depression, and stress were reported by 21.34%, 34.19% and 28.14% of the respondents, respectively.\n A total of 50.43% of respondents presented moderate to severe impact of the outbreak.\n Students from Arts &amp;

COVID-19 Home Confinement on Eating Behaviour and Physical Activity: Results of the ECLB-COVID19 International Online Survey","abstract":"Background: Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home confinement.\n While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined.\n Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions.\n This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours.\n Methods: Following a structured review of the literature, the “Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19)” Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics.\n The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform.\n Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages.\n Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses “before” and “during” confinement conditions.\n Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis.\n The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall).\n Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day.\n Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly.\n Conclusion: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction.\n A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.\n","id":"PMC7352706","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Achraf","surname":"Ammar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Khaled","surname":"Trabelsi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamdi","surname":"Chtourou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Boukhris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liwa","surname":"Masmoudi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bassem","surname":"Bouaziz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ellen","surname":"Bentlage","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniella","surname":"How","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Notger","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Asma","surname":"Aloui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Hammouda","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laisa

(SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention.\n On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern.\n The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century.\n As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO.\n Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to ?-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host.\n The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract.\n Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe.\n The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms.\n The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm.\n Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.\n In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.\n","id":"PMC7068984","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan-Rong","surname":"Guo","email":"guoyr5@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing-Dong","surname":"Cao","email":"Cqd8866@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhong-Si","surname":"Hong","email":"hongzhs@mail.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yang","surname":"Tan","email":"tanyy29@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shou-Deng","surname":"Chen","email":"chenshd5@mail.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong-Jun","surname":"Jin","email":"jinhj3@mail.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kai-Sen","surname":"Tan","email":"enttks@nus.edu.sg","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"De-Yun","surname":"Wang","email":"entwdy@nus.edu.sg","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Yan","email":"yanyan35@mail.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Agricultura,

intervention tasks to neuromodulation techniques.\n We conclude that there is evidence to suggest that, for some individuals, food can induce addictive-type behaviours similar to those seen with other addictive substances.\n However, with several DSM-5 criteria having limited application to overeating, the term ‘food addiction’ is likely to apply only in a minority of cases.\n Nevertheless, research investigating the underlying psychological causes of overeating within the context of food addiction has led to some novel and potentially effective interventions.\n Understanding the

aims to clarify the relationship between recurrent binge eating (RBE) and illicit substance use (ISU) through investigating the temporal association between the two problems.\n (2) Methods: This study was embedded within a larger longitudinal study of non-clinical adult women recruited from Australian tertiary institutions.\n Participants responded at year 2 and year 4 of follow-up to the Eating Disorder Examination—Questionnaire.\n ISU was measured using a modified questionnaire taken from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health.\n (3) Results: RBE and ISU co-morbidity was 5.88% in this non-clinical sample, and having one condition increased the likelihood of the other.\n The two conditions had a different trajectory over two years whereby ISU participants had significant

Distinctive Trait of Severe Cocaine Addiction among Individuals Treated for Cocaine or Alcohol Use Disorders","abstract":"Aims\nDespite alcohol being the most often used addictive substance among addicted patients, use of other substances such as cocaine has increased over recent years, and the combination of both drugs aggravates health impairment and complicates clinical assessment.\n\n The aim of this study is to identify and characterize heterogeneous subgroups of cocaine- and alcohol-addicted patients with common characteristics based on substance use disorders, psychiatric comorbidity and impulsivity.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 214 subjects with cocaine and/or alcohol use disorders were recruited from outpatient treatment programs and clinically assessed.\n\n A latent class analysis was used to establish phenotypic categories according to diagnosis of cocaine and alcohol use disorders, mental disorders, and impulsivity scores.\n\n Relevant variables were examined in the latent classes (LCs) using correlation and analyses of variance and covariance.\n\n\nResults\nFour LCs of addicted patients were identified: Class 1 (45.3%) formed by alcohol-dependent patients exhibiting lifetime mood disorder diagnosis and mild impulsivity; Class 2 (14%) formed mainly by lifetime cocaine use disorder patients with low probability of comorbid mental disorders and mild impulsivity; Class 3 (10.7%) formed by cocaine use disorder patients with elevated probability to course with lifetime anxiety, early and personality disorders, and greater impulsivity scores; and Class 4 (29.9%) formed mainly by patients with alcohol and cocaine use disorders, with elevated probability in early and personality disorders and elevated impulsivity.\n\n Furthermore, there were significant differences among classes in terms of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-4th Edition-Text Revision criteria for abuse and dependence: Class 3 showed more criteria for cocaine use disorders than other classes, while Class 1 and Class 4 showed more criteria for alcohol use disorders.\n\n\nConclusion\nCocaine- and alcohol-addicted patients who were grouped according to diagnosis of substance use disorders, psychiatric comorbidity, and impulsivity show different clinical and sociodemographic variables.\n\n Whereas mood and anxiety disorders are more prevalent in alcohol-addicted patients, personality disorders are associated with cocaine use disorders and diagnosis of comorbid substance use disorders.\n\n Notably, increased impulsivity is a distinctive characteristic of patients with severe cocaine use disorder and comorbid personality disorders.\n\n Psychiatric disorders and impulsivity should be considered for improving the stratification of addicted patients with shared clinical and sociodemographic characteristics to select more appropriate treatments.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5817335","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nuria","surname":"García-Marchena","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Ladrón

consequence of drug exposure or relate to pre-existing addiction vulnerability is unknown.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nThis study compared measures of impulsivity in outpatients with alcohol dependence (n?=?23) and problem gambling (n?=?21), a putative behavioural addiction where direct effects of drug exposure may be minimal.\n\n Healthy controls (n?=?27) were also tested, in a cross-sectional design.\n\n Subjects completed the stop-signal test as a neurocognitive probe of response inhibition, alongside self-report ratings of impulsivity, adult ADHD and OCD.\n\n\nResults\nOn the stop-signal test, Go reaction time and stop-signal reaction time were significantly slower in the alcohol-dependent group, compared with healthy controls.\n\n Healthy controls slowed their responding after successful and failed stop trials.\n\n Slowing after failed stop trials was significantly attenuated in the alcohol-dependent subjects.\n\n Go reaction time and post-error slowing were correlated with chronicity and severity, respectively, in the alcohol-dependent subjects.\n\n Problem gamblers did not differ significantly from controls on the stop-signal test, despite trait elevations in impulsivity ratings.\n\n\nConclusion\nInhibitory control is impaired in alcohol dependence but occurs in the context of psychomotor slowing.\n\n In addition, alcohol-dependent individuals failed to show behavioral adjustment following failed stops.\n\n These deficits may represent direct effects of chronic alcohol administration on fronto-striatal circuitry.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2764851","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Andrew

adolescents’ unhealthy snacking and drinking behavior, mechanisms explaining these associations remain to be explored.\n\n The present study will therefore examine whether the associations between SR and unhealthy snack and/or sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake are mediated by external and/or emotional eating and if this mediation is moderated by availability at home or at school.\n\n\nMethods\nCross-sectional data on snacking, availability of snacks at home and at school, SR (BAS drive scale) and external and emotional eating (Dutch eating behavior questionnaire) of Flemish adolescents (n?=?1104, mean age?=?14.7?±?0.8 years; 51 % boys; 18.0 % overweight) in 20 schools spread across Flanders were collected.\n\n Moderated mediation analyses were conducted using generalized structural equation modeling in three steps: (1) direct association between SR and unhealthy snack or SSB intake, (2) mediation of either external or emotional eating and (3) interaction of home or school availability and emotional or external eating.\n\n\nResults\nPartial mediation of external eating (a*b?=?0.69, p?&lt;?0.05) and of emotional eating (a*b?=?0.92, p?&lt;?0.01) in the relation between SR and intake of unhealthy snacks was found (step 2).\n\n The relation between SR and SSB intake was not mediated by external or emotional eating (step 2).\n\n No moderation effects of home or school availability were found (step 3).\n\n\nConclusion\nOur findings indicate that the association between SR and the consumption of unhealthy snacks is partially explained by external and emotional eating in a population-based sample of adolescents irrespective of the home or school availability of these foods.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4748632","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"De

However, it is currently unclear whether they also show larger food cue-induced increases in craving (i.\ne.\n, food cue reactivity) than those without binge eating, as suggested by conditioning theories of binge eating.\n A group of individuals with BN or BED (binge-eating group, n = 27) and a group of individuals with low trait food craving scores and without binge eating (control group, n = 19) reported their current food craving before and after a food cue exposure.\n Although food craving intensity significantly increased in both groups, this increase was significantly stronger in the binge-eating group than in the control group.\n This result is in line with conditioning models of binge eating that propose that food cues are conditioned stimuli that elicit a conditioned response (e.\ng.\n, food craving) and that this association is stronger in individuals with binge eating.\n As food craving increased in individuals with low trait food craving scores as well—although to a lesser extent—previous null results might be explained by methodological considerations such as not screening control participants for trait food

Adolescent Males and Females- A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Longitudinal Studies","abstract":"Adolescent obesity and depression are increasingly prevalent and are currently recognised as major public health concerns worldwide.\n The aim of this study is to evaluate the bi-directional associations between obesity and depression in adolescents using longitudinal studies.\n A systematic literature search was conducted using Pubmed (including Medline), PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSIS Preview and the Cochrane Library databases.\n According to the inclusion criteria, 13 studies were found where seven studies evaluated depression leading to obesity and six other studies examined obesity leading to depression.\n Using a bias-adjusted quality effects model for the meta-analysis, we found that adolescents who were depressed had a 70% (RR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.40, 2.07) increased risk of being obese, conversely obese adolescents had an increased risk of 40% (RR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.70) of being depressed.\n The risk difference (RD) of early adolescent depression leading to obesity is 3% higher risk than it is for obesity leading to depression.\n In sensitivity analysis, the association between depression leading to obesity was greater than that of obesity leading to depression for females in early adulthood compared with females in late adolescence.\n Overall, the

infants: a randomised controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nMany infants admitted to hospital undergo repeated invasive procedures.\n\n Oral sucrose is frequently given to relieve procedural pain in neonates on the basis of its effect on behavioural and physiological pain scores.\n\n We assessed whether sucrose administration reduces pain-specific brain and spinal cord activity after an acute noxious procedure in newborn infants.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 59 newborn infants at University College Hospital (London, UK) were randomly assigned to receive 0·5 mL 24% sucrose solution or 0·5 mL sterile water 2 min before undergoing a clinically required heel lance.\n\n Randomisation was by a computer-generated randomisation code, and researchers, clinicians, participants, and parents were masked to the identity of the solutions.\n\n The primary outcome was pain-specific brain activity evoked by one time-locked heel lance, recorded with electroencephalography and identified by principal component analysis.\n\n Secondary measures were baseline behavioural and physiological measures, observational pain scores (PIPP), and spinal nociceptive reflex withdrawal activity.\n\n Data were analysed per protocol.\n\n This study is registered, number ISRCTN78390996.\nFindings\n29 infants were assigned to receive sucrose and 30 to sterilised water; 20 and 24 infants, respectively, were included in the analysis of the primary outcome measure.\n\n Nociceptive brain activity after the noxious heel lance did not differ significantly between infants who received sucrose and those who received sterile water (sucrose: mean 0·10, 95% CI 0·04–0·16; sterile water: mean 0·08, 0·04–0·12; p=0·46).\n\n No significant difference was recorded between the sucrose and sterile water groups in the magnitude or latency of the spinal nociceptive reflex withdrawal recorded from the biceps femoris of the stimulated leg.\n\n The PIPP score was significantly lower in infants given sucrose than in those given sterile water (mean 5·8, 95% CI 3·7–7·8 vs 8·5, 7·3–9·8; p=0·02) and significantly more infants had no change in facial expression after sucrose administration (seven of 20 [35%] vs none of 24; p&lt;0·0001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur data suggest that oral sucrose does not significantly affect activity in neonatal brain or spinal cord nociceptive circuits, and therefore might not be an effective analgesic drug.\n\n The ability of sucrose to reduce clinical observational scores after noxious events in newborn infants should not be interpreted as pain relief.\n\n\nFunding\nMedical Research Council.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2958259","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rebeccah","surname":"Slater","email":"r.slater@ucl.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Cornelissen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lorenzo","surname":"Fabrizi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Debbie","surname":"Patten","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jan","surname":"Yoxen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Worley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stewart","surname":"Boyd","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Judith","surname":"Meek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Fitzgerald","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.289.4.450","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Patterns

worsening brain reward deficit.\n Similar changes in reward homeostasis induced by cocaine or heroin is considered a critical trigger in the transition from casual to compulsive drug-taking.\n Accordingly, we detected compulsive-like feeding behavior in obese but not lean rats, measured as palatable food consumption that was resistant to disruption by an aversive conditioned stimulus.\n Striatal dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) were downregulated in obese rats, similar to previous reports in human drug addicts.\n Moreover, lentivirus-mediated knockdown of striatal D2R rapidly accelerated the development of addiction-like reward deficits and the onset of compulsive-like food seeking in rats with extended access to palatable high-fat food.\n These data demonstrate that overconsumption of palatable food triggers addiction-like neuroadaptive responses in brain reward circuitries and drives the development of compulsive eating.\n Common hedonic mechanisms may therefore underlie

(over)compensatory food intake.\n Overeating and resulting weight gain may be induced by genetic predisposition for lower dopaminergic activity, but might also be a behavioral mechanism of compensating for decreased dopamine signaling after dopaminergic overstimulation, for example after smoking cessation or overconsumption of high palatable food.\n This hypothesis is in line with our incidental finding of increased weight gain after discontinuation of pharmaceutical dopaminergic overstimulation in rats.\n These findings support the crucial role of dopaminergic signaling for eating behaviors and offer an explanation for weight-gain after cessation of activities associated with high dopaminergic signaling.\n They further support the possibility that dopaminergic medication could

food choice: a cross-sectional study","abstract":"Objectives\nObesity is on the rise in the US and is linked to the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\n Emerging evidence over the last decade suggests that obesity may also adversely affect executive function and brain structure.\n\n Although a great deal of research focuses on how diet affects the brain and cognitive performance, no study focuses on how food choice may be associated with brain integrity.\n\n Here we investigated how lean and overweight/obese (o/o) adults differed in their food choices and how brain structure and cognition may be associated with those choices.\n\n\nDesign\nAs part of an ongoing study on diabetes and the brain, participants had routine blood work and a research MRI, received a battery of neurocognitive tests, and were instructed to keep a 3-day food diary.\n\n\nResults and conclusions\nThe lean group ate more high quality foods and less low quality foods compared to the o/o group.\n\n In the o/o group, high quality food choices were associated with orbitofrontal cortex volume.\n\n The lean group performed better than the o/o group on neurocognitive measures of executive function, such as the Stroop Interference Test, the Wisconsin Card Sort Test and the Trail Making Test B-A, and on attention and concentration tasks such as the Digit Symbol Substitution Test.\n\n Taken together, these preliminary data suggest that in obesity poor food choices may be associated with frontal cognitive impairments that may be the result of, or contribute to, decreases in orbitofrontal cortex volume.\n\n Therefore, longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate a causal link between food choice and executive functioning.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3191593","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jessica I","surname":"Cohen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kathy

impulsivity has revealed an array of ambiguous findings.\n\n This may be a result of limitations to self-report assessments of impulsivity.\n\n Behavioral measures that assess more narrowly defined aspects of impulsivity may clarify genetic influences.\n\n This study examined the relationship between possession of the DRD2 TaqI A and DRD4 48 bp VNTR genetic polymorphisms and performance on a behavioral measure of impulsivity, the delay discounting task (DDT), and three traditional self-report measures.\n\n\nMethods\n195 individuals (42% male) were recruited from a university campus and were assessed in small group sessions using personal computers.\n\n Genotyping was conducted using previously established protocols.\n\n For the DRD2 TaqI A locus, individuals were designated as possessing at least one copy of the A1 allele (A1+) or not (A1-), and for the DRD4 48-bp VNTR locus, individuals were designated as having at least one long allele (7 repeats or longer, L+) or not (L-).\n\n Principal analyses used multiple univariate factorial 2 (A1+/A1-) × 2 (L+/L-) analyses of variance.\n\n\nResults\nA significant main effect of A1+ status on DDT performance was evident (p = .\n\n006) as well as a significant interaction effect (p = .\n\n006) between both genes.\n\n No other significant effects were evident on the self-report measures, with the exception of a trend toward an interaction effect on the Sensation Seeking Scale.\n\n Exploratory analyses suggested that the significant effects were not a function of population stratification or gender.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThese data suggest that the DRD2 TaqI A and DRD4 VNTR polymorphisms influence impulsivity as measured with a delay discounting task.\n\n Specifically, these findings suggest that an interaction between the functional effects of the two unlinked genotypes results in significant difference in the balance of mesolimbic dopaminergic activation relative to frontal-parietal activation.\n\n However, these findings are also the first in this area and must be replicated.\n\n\nConclusion\nThese findings suggest a meaningful interaction between the DRD2 TaqI A and DRD4 VNTR polymorphisms in the expression of impulsivity and provide initial support for the utility of using behavioral measures for clarifying genetic influences on impulsivity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1781951","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dan

is most commonly observed in drug addiction, where maladaptive behavior (i.\ne.\n, drug seeking) appears to be compulsive, continuing at great personal cost.\n Approach biases toward addictive substances have been correlated with actual drug-use in a number of studies, suggesting that this measure can, in some cases, index everyday maladaptive tendencies.\n At present it is unclear whether this bias to drug cues is a Pavlovian conditioned approach response, a habitual response, the result of a Pavlovian-instrumental transfer process, or a goal-directed action in the sense that expectancy of the rewarding effects of drugs controls approach.\n We consider this question by combining the theoretical framework of associative learning with the available evidence from approach bias research.\n Although research investigating the relative contributions of these mechanisms to the approach bias is to date relatively limited, we review existing studies and also outline avenues

drinking behavior, a possible way to obtain a behavioral change is changing these implicit attitudes.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis study examined whether a change in implicit attitudes and in drinking behavior can be achieved via evaluative conditioning.\n\n\nMethods\nParticipants were randomly assigned to an experimental condition and a control condition.\n\n In the experimental condition, participants were subjected to an evaluative conditioning procedure that consistently pairs alcohol-related cues with negative stimuli.\n\n In the control condition, alcohol-related cues were consistently paired with neutral stimuli during the evaluative conditioning phase.\n\n Implicit attitudes, explicit attitudes, and drinking behavior were measured before and after the evaluative conditioning phase.\n\n\nResults\nFollowing the evaluative conditioning procedure, participants in the experimental condition showed stronger negative implicit attitudes toward alcohol and consumed less alcohol compared to participants in the control condition.\n\n However, this effect was only found when the evaluative conditioning task paired alcohol-related cues with general negative pictures, but not when using pictures of frowning faces.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results demonstrate that evaluative conditioning can effectively change implicit attitudes toward alcohol and also suggest that this procedure can be used to change drinking behavior.\n\n Hence, evaluative conditioning may be a useful new intervention tool to combat alcohol

lean and overweight/obese adults: a moderated-mediation model","abstract":"Background/Objectives:\nThe relationship between response inhibition and obesity is currently unclear.\n\n This may be because of inconsistencies in methodology, design limitations and the use of narrow samples.\n\n In addition, dietary restraint has not been considered, yet restraint has been reported to moderate performance on behavioural tasks of response inhibition.\n\n The aim of this study was to investigate performance on both a food-based and a neutral stimuli go/no-go task, which addresses current design limitations, in lean and overweight/obese adults.\n\n The moderating role of dietary restraint in the relationship between body composition, response inhibition and snack intake was also measured.\n\n\nSubjects/Methods:\nLean and overweight/obese, males and females (N=116) completed both a food-based and neutral category control go/no-go task, in a fully counterbalanced repeated-measures design.\n\n A bogus taste-test was then completed, followed by a self-report measure of dietary restraint.\n\n\nResults:\nPROCESS moderated-mediation analysis showed that overweight/obese, compared with lean, participants made more errors on the food-based (but not the neutral) go/no-go task, but only when they were low in dietary restraint.\n\n Performance on the food-based go/no-go task predicted snack intake across the sample.\n\n Increased intake in the overweight, low restrainers was fully mediated by increased errors on the food-based (but not the neutral) go/no-go task.\n\n\nConclusions:\nDistinguishing between high and low restrained eaters in the overweight/obese population is crucial in future obesity research incorporating food-based go/no-go tasks.\n\n Poor response inhibition to food cues predicts overeating across weight groups, suggesting weight loss interventions and obesity prevention programmes should target behavioural inhibition training in such individuals.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4856731","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"M","surname":"Price","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S","surname":"Higgs","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jbtep.2011.02.008","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Overcoming

transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is gaining reliability, a useful therapeutic tool in drug addiction, since it can modulate cortico-limbic activity resulting in reduction of drug craving.\n\n\nAims\nIn the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of bilateral TMS of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in reducing cocaine intake, in a sample of treatment-seeking patients with current cocaine use disorder (DSM-V).\n\n\nMethods\nTen cocaine addicts (DSM-V) were randomly assigned to the active or sham stimulation protocol in a double-blind experimental design.\n\n Twelve repetitive TMS (rTMS) sessions were administered three times a week for 4 weeks at 100% of motor threshold, over bilateral PFC.\n\n Cocaine intake (ng/mg) was assessed by hair analysis at baseline (before treatment, T0), after 1 month (end of treatment, T1), 3 (T2), and 6 (T3) months later.\n\n All subjects received psychological support weekly.\n\n\nResults\nThe two-way ANOVA for repeated measures did not show a significant effect of the interaction between time and treatment (F4,32?=?0.35; p?=?0.87).\n\n Despite that result indicated no difference in the effect of the two conditions (active vs.\n\n sham) along time, a decreasing trend in cocaine consumption in active TMS group (F3,23?=?3.42; p?=?0.04) vs.\n\n sham (F3,15?=?1.88; p?=?0.20) was observed when we performed exploratory analysis with time as factor.\n\n Indeed, Post hoc comparisons showed a significant reduction in the amount of cocaine detected from the onset to 3?months later (T0–T2; p?=?0.02) and to the end of treatment (T0–T3; p?=?0.01) in addicts from the active group.\n\n\nConclusion\nBilateral rTMS of PFC at 10?Hz did not show a significant effect on cocaine intake compared to sham.\n\n However, a long-term reduction on cocaine intake in active TMS-treated patients was observed when we considered the time as factor.\n\n Further studies are required to confirm these encouraging but preliminary findings, in order to consolidate rTMS as a valid tool to treat cocaine addiction.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4976094","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Corinna","surname":"Bolloni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Riccardo","surname":"Panella","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mariano","surname":"Pedetti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anna

One brain area, which is hypothesized to be critically involved in modulating this feeling (also called presence) is the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), an area also associated with the control of impulsive behavior.\n\n\nMethods\nIn our experiment we applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the right dlPFC in order to modulate the experience of presence while watching a virtual roller coaster ride.\n\n During the ride we also registered electro-dermal activity.\n\n Subjects also performed a test measuring impulsiveness and answered a questionnaire about their presence feeling while they were exposed to the virtual roller coaster scenario.\n\n\nResults\nApplication of cathodal tDCS to the right dlPFC while subjects were exposed to a virtual roller coaster scenario modulates the electrodermal response to the virtual reality stimulus.\n\n In addition, measures reflecting impulsiveness were also modulated by application of cathodal tDCS to the right dlPFC.\n\n\nConclusion\nModulating the activation with the right dlPFC results in substantial changes in responses of the vegetative nervous system and changed impulsiveness.\n\n The effects can be explained by theories discussing the top-down influence of the right dlPFC on the 'impulsive

Hypothesis of Drug Addiction and Its Potential Therapeutic Value","abstract":"Dopamine (DA) transmission is deeply affected by drugs of abuse, and alterations in DA function are involved in the various phases of drug addiction and potentially exploitable therapeutically.\n In particular, basic studies have documented a reduction in the electrophysiological activity of DA neurons in alcohol, opiate, cannabinoid, and other drug-dependent rats.\n Further, DA release in the Nucleus accumbens (Nacc) is decreased in virtually all drug-dependent rodents.\n In parallel, these studies are supported by increments in intracranial self stimulation (ICSS) thresholds during withdrawal from alcohol, nicotine, opiates, and other drugs of abuse, thereby suggesting a hypofunction of the neural substrate of ICSS.\n Accordingly, morphological evaluations fed into realistic computational analysis of the medium spiny neuron of the Nacc, post-synaptic counterpart of DA terminals, show profound changes in structure and function of the entire mesolimbic system.\n In line with these findings, human imaging studies have shown a reduction of dopamine receptors accompanied by a lesser release of endogenous DA in the ventral striatum of cocaine, heroin, and alcohol-dependent subjects, thereby offering visual proof of the “dopamine-impoverished” addicted human brain.\n The lasting reduction in physiological activity of the DA system leads to the idea that an increment in its activity, to restore pre-drug levels, may yield significant clinical improvements (reduction of craving, relapse, and drug-seeking/taking).\n In theory, it may be achieved pharmacologically and/or with novel interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).\n Its anatomo-physiological rationale as a possible therapeutic aid in alcoholics and other addicts will be described and proposed as a theoretical framework to be subjected to experimental testing in human addicts.\n","id":"PMC3225760","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marco","surname":"Diana","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-15-j0003.2001","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Repetitive

clinically useful in the treatment of drug addiction.\n\n\nMethods:\nWe conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial aiming to assess the effects of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex transcranial direct current stimulation (left cathodal/right anodal) on crack-cocaine addiction.\n\n We defined craving as the primary outcome, and other clinical measurements, including depressive and anxiety symtoms, and quality of life, as secondary outcomes.\n\n Seventeen male crack-cocaine users (mean age 30.4±9.8 SD) were randomized to receive 5 sessions of active transcranial direct

is a multimodal brain region with regional cytoarchitectonic differences indicating various functional specializations.\n As a multisensory neural node, the insular cortex integrates perception, emotion, interoceptive awareness, cognition, and gustation.\n Regarding the latter, predominantly the anterior part of the insular cortex is regarded as the primary taste cortex.\n In this review, we will specifically focus on the involvement of the insula in food processing and on multimodal integration of food-related items.\n Influencing factors of insular activation elicited by various foods range from calorie-content to the internal physiologic state, body mass index or eating behavior.\n Sensory perception of food-related stimuli including seeing, smelling, and tasting elicits increased activation in the anterior and mid-dorsal part of the insular cortex.\n Apart from the pure sensory gustatory processing, there is also a strong association with the rewarding/hedonic aspects of food items, which is reflected in higher insular activity and stronger connections to other reward-related areas.\n Interestingly, the processing of food items has been found to elicit different insular activation in lean compared to obese subjects and in patients suffering from an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN)).\n The knowledge of functional differences in the insular cortex opens up the opportunity for possible noninvasive treatment approaches for obesity and eating disorders.\n To target brain functions directly, real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging

of visual food cue reactivity: a potential avenue to alter incentive sensitization and craving","abstract":"id='Par1'>FMRI-based neurofeedback transforms functional brain activation in real-time into sensory stimuli that participants can use to self-regulate brain responses, which can aid the modification of mental states and behavior.\n Emerging evidence supports the clinical utility of neurofeedback-guided up-regulation of hypoactive networks.\n In contrast, down-regulation of hyperactive neural circuits appears more difficult to achieve.\n There are conditions though, in which down-regulation would be clinically useful, including dysfunctional motivational states elicited by salient reward cues, such as food or drug craving.\n In this proof-of-concept study, 10 healthy females (mean age = 21.40 years, mean BMI = 23.53) who had fasted for 4 h underwent a novel ‘motivational neurofeedback’ training in which they learned to down-regulate brain activation during exposure to appetitive food pictures.\n FMRI feedback was given from individually determined target areas and through decreases/increases in food picture size, thus providing salient motivational consequences in terms of cue approach/avoidance.\n Our preliminary findings suggest that motivational neurofeedback is associated with functionally specific activation decreases in diverse cortical/subcortical regions, including key motivational areas.\n There was also preliminary evidence for a reduction of hunger after neurofeedback and an association between down-regulation success and the degree of hunger reduction.\n Decreasing neural cue responses by motivational neurofeedback may provide a useful extension of existing behavioral methods that aim to modulate cue reactivity.\n Our pilot findings indicate that reduction of neural cue reactivity is not achieved by top-down regulation but arises in a bottom-up manner, possibly through implicit operant shaping of target area activity.\n","id":"PMC5486584","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Niklas","surname":"Ihssen","email":"niklas.ihssen@durham.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Moses

countries to implement strict sanitary regimes and social distancing measures.\n Globally, at least four billion people were under lockdown, working remotely, homeschooling children, and facing challenges coping with quarantine and the stressful events.\n The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1097), conducted during a nationwide quarantine, aimed to assess whether nutritional and consumer habits have been affected under these conditions.\n Over 43.0% and nearly 52% reported eating and snacking more, respectively, and these tendencies were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals.\n Almost 30% and over 18% experienced weight gain (mean ± SD 3.0 ± 1.6 kg) and loss (?2.9 ± 1.5 kg), respectively.\n Overweight, obese, and older subjects (aged 36–45 and &gt;45) tended to gain weight more frequently, whereas those with underweight tended to lose it further.\n Increased BMI was associated with less frequent consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes during quarantine, and higher adherence to meat, dairy, and fast-foods.\n An increase in alcohol consumption was seen in 14.6%, with a higher tendency to drink more found among alcohol addicts.\n Over 45% of smokers experienced a rise in smoking frequency during the quarantine.\n The study highlights that lockdown imposed to contain an infectious agent may affect eating behaviors and dietary habits, and advocates for organized nutritional support during future epidemic-related quarantines, particularly for the most vulnerable groups, including overweight and obese

kind of disasters these days.\n\n Among them the 2015 middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak imposed great psychological stress on almost all Korean citizens.\n\n Following the MERS outbreak, government is reviewing overall infectious disease management system and prioritizing the establishment of mental health service systems for infectious disease.\n\n This study makes suggestions for implementing disaster-related mental health service systems by analyzing the example of Gyeonggi Province, which proactively intervened with residents’ psychological problems caused by the large-scale outbreak of an infectious disease.\n\n\nCase description\nMental health service system for MERS victims had the following two parts: a mental health service for people who had been placed in quarantine and a service provided to families of patients who had died or recovered patients.\n\n The government of Gyeonggi province, public health centers, regional and local Community Mental Health Centers and the National Center for Crisis Mental Health Management participated in this service system.\n\n Among 1221 Gyeonggi people placed in quarantine and who experienced psychological and emotional difficulties, 350 required continuing services; 124 of this group received continuing services.\n\n That is, 35 % of people who required psychological intervention received contact from service providers and received the required services.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study reflects a proactive monitoring system for thousands of people placed under quarantine for the first time in Korea.\n\n It is significant that the service utilization rate by a proactive manner, that is the professionals administering it actively approached and contacted people with problems rather than passively providing information was much higher than other general mental health situation in Korea.\n\n The core value of public mental health services is adequate public accessibility; it is therefore essential for governments to strengthen their professional competence and establish effective systems.\n\n These criteria should also be applied to psychological problems caused by disastrous infectious disease outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4976505","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mi-Kyung","surname":"Yoon","email":"sara0314@hanmail.net","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Soon-Young","surname":"Kim","email":"poshksy@naver.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hye-Sun","surname":"Ko","email":"blunt1225@hanmail.net","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Myung-Soo","surname":"Lee","email":"mslee1010@gmail.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1007.030703","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS

psychosocial variables and working conditions, and nurses’ coping methods and distress in response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis in Canada.\n\n\nParticipants and procedure\nThe sample consisted of 333 nurses (315 women, 18 men) who completed an Internet-mediated questionnaire that was posted on the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario (RNAO) website between March and May 2004. The questionnaire was restricted to respondents who had to authenticate their RNAO membership with a valid username and password before accessing the questionnaire.\n\n This served a dual purpose: to ensure that only RNAO nurses completed the questionnaire and thereby safeguarding the generalizability of the findings; and second, to prevent any one nurse from contributing more than once to the overall sample.\n\n\nResults\nCorrelational analysis yielded several significant relationships between psychosocial variables and working conditions, and the traditional correlates of burnout and stress.\n\n Three multiple regression analysis revealed that the model we evolved—including higher levels of vigor, organizational support, and trust in equipment/infection control initiative; and lower levels of contact with SARS patients, and time spent in quarantine—predicted to lower levels of avoidance behavior, emotional exhaustion, and state anger.\n\n\nConclusions\nBy employing models of stress and burnout that combine psychosocial variables and working conditions, researchers can account for significant amounts of variance in outcomes related to burnout.\n\n These findings highlight the importance of vigor and perceived organizational support in predicting nurses’ symptoms of burnout.\n\n For healthcare administrators, this means that a likely strategy for assuaging the negative outcomes of stress should address nurses’ psychosocial concerns and the working conditions that they face during novel times of crisis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094220","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zdravko","surname":"Marjanovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Esther

and Stress-Induced Hypophagia: Examining the Role of Hindbrain Neurons Expressing Prolactin-Releasing Peptide or Glucagon-Like Peptide 1","abstract":"Neural circuits distributed within the brainstem, hypothalamus, and limbic forebrain interact to control food intake and energy balance under normal day-to-day conditions, and in response to stressful conditions under which homeostasis is threatened.\n Experimental studies using rats and mice have generated a voluminous literature regarding the functional organization of circuits that inhibit food intake in response to satiety signals, and in response to stress.\n Although the central neural bases of satiation and stress-induced hypophagia often are studied and discussed as if they were distinct, we propose that both behavioral states are generated, at least in part, by recruitment of two separate but intermingled groups of caudal hindbrain neurons.\n One group comprises a subpopulation of noradrenergic (NA) neurons within the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNST; A2 cell group) that is immunopositive for prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP).\n The second group comprises non-adrenergic neurons within the cNST and nearby reticular formation that synthesize glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1).\n Axonal projections from PrRP and GLP-1 neurons target distributed brainstem and forebrain regions that shape behavioral, autonomic, and endocrine responses to actual or anticipated homeostatic challenge, including the challenge of food intake.\n Evidence reviewed in this article supports the view that hindbrain PrRP and GLP-1 neurons contribute importantly to satiation and stress-induced hypophagia by modulating the activity of caudal brainstem circuits that control food intake.\n Hindbrain PrRP and GLP-1 neurons also engage hypothalamic and limbic forebrain networks that drive parallel behavioral and endocrine functions related to food intake and homeostatic challenge, and modulate conditioned and motivational aspects of food intake.\n","id":"PMC3549516","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"James

US and UK participants’ median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR 2.0%-10.0%), respectively.\n\n Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior.\n\n For instance, 37.8% (95% CI 36.1%-39.6%) of US participants and 29.7% (95% CI 28.1%-31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was “highly effective” in protecting them from acquiring COVID-19, and 25.6% (95% CI 24.1%-27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI 28.0%-31.3%) of UK participants thought it was prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants.\n\n Around half (53.8%, 95% CI 52.1%-55.6%) of US participants and 39.1% (95% CI 37.4%-40.9%) of UK participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2.\nConclusions\nThe distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the US and UK general population.\n\n The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media.\n\n More broadly, rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public’s knowledge and misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7124956","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gloria Ejehiohen","surname":"Iyawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Gloria Ejehiohen","surname":"Iyawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mohammad Amin","surname":"Bahrami","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pascal","surname":"Geldsetzer","email":"pgeldsetzer@stanford.edu","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Pascal","surname":"Geldsetzer","email":"pgeldsetzer@stanford.edu","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/1471-2288-11-62","date":"2011-05-06","title":"Effect of questionnaire length, personalisation and reminder type on response rate to a complex postal survey: randomised controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nMinimising participant non-response in postal surveys helps to maximise the generalisability of the inferences made from the data collected.\n\n The aim of this study was to examine the effect of questionnaire length, personalisation and reminder type on postal survey response rate and quality and to compare the cost-effectiveness of the alternative survey strategies.\n\n\nMethods\nIn a pilot study for a population study of travel behaviour, physical activity and the environment, 1000 participants sampled from the UK edited electoral register were randomly allocated using a 2 × 2 factorial design to receive one of four survey packs: a personally addressed long (24 page) questionnaire pack, a personally addressed short (15 page) questionnaire pack, a non-personally addressed long questionnaire pack or a non-personally addressed short questionnaire pack.\n\n Those who did not return a questionnaire were stratified by initial randomisation group and further randomised to receive either a full reminder pack or a reminder postcard.\n\n The effects of the survey design factors on response were examined using multivariate logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAn overall response rate of 17% was achieved.\n\n Participants who received the short version of the questionnaire were more likely to respond (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.07).\n\n In those participants who received a reminder, personalisation of the survey pack and reminder also increased the odds of response (OR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.95).\n\n Item non-response was relatively low, but was significantly higher in the long questionnaire than the short (9.8% vs 5.8%;

factors related to lifestyle and diet.\n\n Further adjustment for body mass index and waist circumference attenuated the association between red meat and hs-CRP (P = 0.19).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results of this study suggest that high consumption of whole-grain bread is related to lower levels of GGT, ALT and hs-CRP, whereas high consumption of red meat is associated with higher circulating levels of GGT and hs-CRP.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3549403","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jukka","surname":"Montonen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Heiner","surname":"Boeing","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Fritsche","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erwin","surname":"Schleicher","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hans-Georg","surname":"Joost","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthias

model-based analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK

Department of Health data reveal an upward trend of dengue cases in Aceh since the events of the tsunami.\n\n Despite the increasing incidence of dengue in the region, there is limited understanding of dengue among the general population of Aceh.\n\n The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding dengue among the people of Aceh, Indonesia in order to design intervention strategies for an effective dengue prevention program.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Aceh between November 2014 and March 2015 with a total of 609 participants living in seven regencies and two municipalities.\n\n Information on the socio-demographic characteristics of participants and their KAP regarding dengue was collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire.\n\n The KAP status (good vs.\n\n poor) of participants with different socio-demographic characteristics was compared using Chi Square-test, ANOVA or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate.\n\n Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of each KAP domain.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>We found that 45% of participants had good knowledge regarding dengue and only 32% had good attitudes and good dengue preventive practices.\n\n There was a significant positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes, knowledge and practice, and attitudes and practice.\n\n In addition, people who had good knowledge were 2.7 times more likely to have good attitudes, and people who had good attitudes were 2.2 times more likely to have good practices regarding dengue.\n\n The level of education, occupation, marital status, monthly income, socioeconomic status (SES) and living in the city were associated with the knowledge

factors among a random sample of university students from 22 universities in 22 low, middle income and emerging economy countries.\n This cross-sectional survey comprised of a self-administered questionnaire and collected anthropometric measurements.\n The study population was 6773 (43.2%) males and 8913 (56.8%) females, aged 16 to 30 years (mean 20.8 years, SD = 2.6).\n Body mass index (BMI) was used for weight status.\n Among men, the prevalence of underweight was 10.8%, normal weight 64.4%, overweight 18.9% and obesity 5.8%, while among women, the prevalence of underweight was 17.6%, normal weight 62.1%, overweight 14.1% and obesity 5.2%.\n Overall, 22% were overweight or obese (24.7% men and 19.3% women).\n In multivariate regression among men, younger age, coming from a higher income country, consciously avoiding fat and cholesterol, physically inactivity, current tobacco use and childhood physical abuse, and among women older age, coming from a higher income

The subjects were divided into non-obese (body mass index [BMI] &lt; 25 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ? 25 kg/m2) groups and further divided according to weekly alcohol consumption into nondrinking (0 drinks/week), moderate drinking (? 14 drinks/week), and heavy drinking (&gt; 14 drinks/week) groups.\n\n The subjects were also categorized into binge drinking and non-binge drinking groups.\n\n To obtain odds ratios (ORs) for metabolic syndrome, binary logistic regression analysis was performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe overall metabolic syndrome prevalence was 27.3% (12.8%, non-obese group; 50.4%, obese group).\n\n After adjusting for age, physical activity, and smoking, in the non-obese group, the OR for heavy drinking with binge drinking (reference: nondrinking) was 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12–2.18), with a significant increase in metabolic syndrome prevalence.\n\n In the obese group, the OR for heavy drinking with binge drinking was 1.42 (95% CI = 1.07–1.88), showing a significant increase in metabolic syndrome prevalence (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn both non-obese and obese Korean males, heavy drinking with binge drinking was associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome.\n\n Thus, both non-obese and obese males should restrict their alcohol intake and not indulge in binge drinking.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5886969","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jung

after CoA.\n\n\nResults\nSympathetic activation increased (control: 74±3 vs.\n\n 77±3 bpm, p=0.0098; AF: 60±2 vs.\n\n 64±2 bpm, p=0.0076) and parasympathetic activation decreased HR (control: 71±3 vs.\n\n 69±3 bpm, p=0.0547; AF: 60±1 vs.\n\n 58±2 bpm, p&lt;0.0009), while CoA induced a paradoxical HR increase in patients with AF (control: 73±3 vs.\n\n 71±3 bpm, p=0.084; AF: 59±2 vs.\n\n 61±2 bpm, p=0.0006), which was abolished after PVI.\n\n Non-linear parameters of HR variability (SD1) were impaired during coactivation in patients with AF (control: 61±7 vs.\n\n 69±6 ms, p=0.042, AF: 44±32 vs.\n\n 32±5 ms, p=0.3929).\n\n CoA was associated with a shift of the earliest activation site (18±4 mm) of the sinoatrial nodal region, as documented by ultra-high-density mapping (3442±343 points per map).\n\n\nConclusions\nCoA perturbs HR dynamics and shifts the site of earliest endocardial activation in patients with paroxysmal AF.\n\n This effect is abolished by PVI, supporting the value of emerging methods targeting the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system to treat AF.\n\n CoA might be a valuable tool to assess cardiac autonomic function in a clinical setting.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5910663","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Eickholt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christiane","surname":"Jungen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Drexel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fares","surname":"Alken","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pawel","surname":"Kuklik","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jens","surname":"Muehlsteff","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hisaki","surname":"Makimoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Boris","surname":"Hoffmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Malte","surname":"Kelm","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Ziegler","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nikolaj","surname":"Kloecker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephan","surname":"Willems","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Meyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.autneu.2022.103009","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Respiratory

COVID-19","abstract":"Background\nAlong with its high infectivity and fatality rates, the 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has caused universal psychosocial impact by causing mass hysteria, economic burden and financial losses.\n\n Mass fear of COVID-19, termed as “coronaphobia”, has generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across the different strata of the society.\n\n So, this review has been undertaken to define psychosocial impact of COVID-19.\nMethods\nPubmed and GoogleScholar are searched with the following key terms- “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV2”, “Pandemic”, “Psychology”, “Psychosocial”, “Psychitry”, “marginalized”, “telemedicine”, “mental health”, “quarantine”, “infodemic”, “social media” and” “internet”.\n\n Few news paper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context.\n\n\nResults\nDisease itself multiplied by forced quarantine to combat COVID-19 applied by nationwide lockdowns can produce acute panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, hoarding, paranoia, and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the long run.\n\n These have been fueled by an “infodemic” spread via different platforms of social media.\n\n Outbursts of racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against particular communities are also being widely reported.\n\n Nevertheless, frontline healthcare workers are at higher-risk of contracting the disease as well as experiencing adverse psychological outcomes in form of burnout, anxiety, fear of transmitting infection, feeling of incompatibility, depression, increased substance-dependence, and PTSD.\n\n Community-based mitigation programs to combat COVID-19 will disrupt children’s usual lifestyle and may cause florid mental distress.\n\n The psychosocial aspects of older people, their caregivers, psychiatric patients and marginalized communities are affected by this pandemic in different ways and need special attention.\n\n\nConclusion\nFor better dealing with these psychosocial issues of different strata of the society, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models should be urgently developed by the government, health care personnel and other stakeholders.\n\n Apt application of internet services, technology and social media to curb both pandemic and infodemic needs to be instigated.\n\n Psychosocial preparedness by setting up mental organizations specific for future pandemics is certainly necessary.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7255207","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Souvik","surname":"Dubey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Payel","surname":"Biswas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ritwik","surname":"Ghosh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Subhankar","surname":"Chatterjee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mahua

disruption in diet and lifestyle in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).\n\n We aimed to study lifestyle changes and other common issues related to treatment in our previously seen and treated patients with T2DM.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients (n, 150) who were regularly following up before lockdown were interviewed telephonically (after 45 days of start of lockdown) regarding lifestyle changes, stress and other diabetes-related questions.\n\n\nResult\nCarbohydrate consumption and frequency of snacking increased in 21% and 23% patients, respectively.\n\n Interestingly, 27% patients reported an increase in consumption of fruits.\n\n Exercise duration was reduced in 42% and weight gain occurred in 19% patients.\n\n Frequency of doing self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) was decreased in

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt;

China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19

A conceptual framework is offered which equates high well-being with positive mental health.\n Well-being is seen as lying at the opposite end of a spectrum to the common mental disorders (depression, anxiety).\n By examining internationally agreed criteria for depression and anxiety (DSM and ICD classifications), and defining the opposite of each symptom, we identify ten features of positive well-being.\n These combine feeling and functioning, i.\ne.\n hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being: competence, emotional stability, engagement, meaning, optimism, positive emotion, positive relationships, resilience, self esteem, and vitality.\n An operational definition of flourishing is developed, based on psychometric analysis of indicators of these ten features, using data from a representative sample of 43,000 Europeans.\n Application of this definition to respondents from the 23 countries which participated in the European Social Survey (Round 3) reveals a four-fold difference in flourishing rate, from 41% in Denmark to less than 10% in Slovakia, Russia and Portugal.\n There are also striking differences in country profiles across the 10 features.\n These profiles offer fresh insight into cultural differences in well-being, and indicate which features may provide the most promising targets for policies to improve well-being.\n Comparison with a life satisfaction measure shows that valuable information would be lost if well-being was measured by life satisfaction.\n Taken together, our findings reinforce the need to measure subjective well-being as a multi-dimensional construct in future surveys.\n","id":"PMC3545194","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Felicia A.","surname":"Huppert","email":"fah2@cam.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Timothy T.

five pillars of wellbeing: Positive emotions, Relationships, Engagement, Meaning, and Accomplishment.\n\n\nMethods\nAustralian adults (N = 439) completed the PERMA Profiler and measures of physical and mental health (SF-12), depression, anxiety, stress (DASS 21), subjective physical activity (Active Australia Survey), and objective activity and sleep (GENEActiv accelerometer).\n\n Internal consistency was examined using Cronbach’s alpha and associations between theoretically related constructs examined using Pearson’s correlation.\n\n Model fit in comparison with theorised models was examined via Confirmatory Factor Analysis.\n\n\nResults\nResults indicated acceptable internal consistency for overall PERMA Profiler scores and all subscales (? range = 0.80–0.93) except Engagement (? = 0.66).\n\n Moderate associations were found between PERMA Profiler wellbeing scores with subjective constructs (e.\n\ng.\n\n depression, anxiety, stress; r = -0.374 - -0.645, p = &lt;0.001) but not objective physical activity or sleep.\n\n Data failed to meet model fit criteria for neither the theorised five-factor nor an alternative single-factor structure.\n\n\nConclusions\nFindings were mixed, providing strong support for the scale’s internal consistency and moderate support for congervent and divergent validity, albeit not in comparison to objectively captured activity outcomes.\n\n

Measure of Adolescent Wellbeing: Further Testing of the Psychometrics of the Measure","abstract":"Given the enormous population of Chinese-speaking people worldwide, it is important to establish measures of adolescent wellbeing with adequate evidence for reliability and validity.\n The EPOCH Measure of Adolescent Wellbeing assesses five positive psychological characteristics (engagement, perseverance, optimism, connectedness, and happiness).\n An initial study with the English version of the measure found support for a five-factor structure, and evidence for internal reliability, convergence with other wellbeing measures, and divergence across factors and with unrelated constructs.\n An initial study translated the measure into Chinese and found support for the factor structure of the measure.\n To further test the measure’s psychometric properties, data were collected from 11 Chinese student samples (N = 17,854) from several regions of China.\n All students completed the EPOCH measure, along with a variety of other measures.\n In cases where measures overlapped, samples were combined, with relevant sub-sets used to examine convergent and divergent patterns.\n Confirmatory analyses supported the five-factor structure and factors were internally reliable, but consistency over time was low.\n The five factors were more strongly correlated with other wellbeing factors than with illbeing factors.\n While some correlations demonstrated expected convergent and divergent patterns with other constructs, there were also considerable deviations from expected patterns.\n Norm values specific to the Chinese version of the measure are provided.\n The study supports the EPOCH measure as a useful cross-sectional tool for measuring adolescent positive functioning, but additional consideration of cross time stability, change, and correlations with other constructs is needed.\n","id":"PMC6617957","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Guang","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Margaret

To derive a standard definition of insufficient physical activity and to adjust for urban-only survey coverage, we used regression models.\n\n We estimated time trends using multilevel mixed-effects modelling.\n\n\nFindings\nWe used data from 298 school-based surveys from 146 countries, territories, and areas including 1·6 million students aged 11–17 years.\n\n Globally, in 2016, 81·0% (95% uncertainty interval 77·8–87·7) of students aged 11–17 years were insufficiently physically active (77·6% [76·1–80·4] of boys and 84·7% [83·0–88·2] of girls).\n\n Although prevalence of insufficient physical activity significantly decreased between 2001 and 2016 for boys (from 80·1% [78·3–81·6] in 2001), there was no significant change for girls (from 85·1% [83·1–88·0] in 2001).\n\n There was no clear pattern according to country income group: insufficient activity prevalence in 2016 was 84·9% (82·6–88·2) in low-income countries, 79·3% (77·2–87·5) in lower–middle-income countries, 83·9% (79·5–89·2) in upper–middle-income countries, and 79·4% (74·0–86·2) in high-income countries.\n\n The region with the highest prevalence of insufficient activity in 2016 was high-income Asia Pacific for both boys (89·0%, 62·8–92·2) and girls (95·6%, 73·7–97·9).\n\n The regions with the lowest prevalence were high-income western countries for boys (72·1%, 71·1–73·6), and south Asia for girls (77·5%, 72·8–89·3).\n\n In 2016, 27 countries had a prevalence of insufficient activity of 90% or more for girls, whereas this was the case for two countries for boys.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe majority of adolescents do not meet current physical activity guidelines.\n\n Urgent scaling up of implementation of known effective policies and programmes is needed to increase activity in adolescents.\n\n Investment and leadership at all levels to intervene on the multiple causes and inequities that might perpetuate the low participation in physical activity and sex differences, as well as engagement of youth themselves, will be vital to strengthen the opportunities for physical activity in all communities.\n\n Such action will improve the health of this and future young generations and support achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\nFunding\nWHO.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6919336","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Regina","surname":"Guthold","email":"gutholdr@who.int","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gretchen

lifestyle behaviours and may have affected weight management.\n\n The objective of the present study was to examine perceptions of how weight?related lifestyle changed in social lockdown among UK adults compared with before the emergence of the COVID?19 crisis.\n\n\nMethods\nAs part of an online cross?sectional survey conducted during social lockdown in the United Kingdom, 723 UK adults reported on the extent to which their eating (healthiness of diet, frequency of bingeing on food), physical activity, sleep and alcohol consumption had changed since the emergence of the COVID?19 crisis and completed measures of current psychological well?being.\n\n\nResults\nAlthough both improvements and declines in weight gain protective behaviours were reported, 79% of participants reported a decline in one or more weight gain protective behaviours.\n\n Both participants with a diagnosis of psychiatric illness or obesity (body mass index [BMI] ? 30) were most likely to report declines in weight gain protective behaviours and show an overall profile of weight management behaviours worsening.\n\n Participants experiencing high levels of stress also reported reductions in more weight gain protective behaviours.\n\n\nConclusions\nLifestyle behaviours associated with weight gain are likely to have been affected by the COVID?19 crisis.\n\n Reductions to the perceived frequency by which people engage in behaviours usually associated with successful weight management appear to be common, and people living with obesity and mental health problems may be at increased

rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an

health and physical health.\n We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research.\n These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time.\n The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative.\n International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial.\n An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required.\n Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience.\n New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure.\n This Position Paper provides a strategy that may be both adapted for, and integrated with, research efforts in other

physical activity could prevent the development of these diseases.\n\n The purpose of this review is to summarize existing evidence for the long-term (&gt;5 years) relationship between physical activity and weight gain, obesity, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.\n\n\nMethods\nFifteen longitudinal studies with at least 5-year follow up times

Update","abstract":"id='Par1'>Recreational alcohol intake is a widespread activity globally and alcohol energy (7 kcal/g) can be a contributing factor to weight gain if not compensated for.\n Given that both excessive alcohol intake and obesity are of public health interest, the present paper provides an update on the association between alcohol consumption and body weight.\n In general, recent prospective studies show that light-to-moderate alcohol intake is not associated with adiposity gain while heavy drinking is more consistently related to weight gain.\n Experimental evidence is also mixed and suggests that moderate intake of alcohol does not lead to weight gain over short follow-up periods.\n However, many factors can explain the conflicting findings and a better characterization of individuals more likely to gain weight as a result of alcohol consumption is needed.\n In particular, individuals who frequently drink moderate amounts of alcohol may enjoy a healthier lifestyle in general that may protect them from weight gain.\n In conclusion, despite the important limitations of current studies, it is reasonable to say that alcohol intake may be a risk factor for obesity in some individuals, likely based on a multitude of factors, some of which are discussed

The threat of infection affects the work and life of most of the population and may also damage sleep.\n\n This study aims to examine the subjective sleep status and mental health of the population during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\n\nMethod\nThe data were collected through an online questionnaire with a sample of 5461 individuals in China from February 5, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Participants were divided into four groups based on their degree of threat from COVID-19: Group 1 was most closely associated with COVID-19, including inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19, first-line hospital workers and first-line management staff; Group 2 included outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients who developed a fever and visited the hospital; Group 3 included people related to Group 1 or 2, such as their colleagues, relatives, friends and rescuers; and Group 4 was the farthest removed from contact with COVID-19, covering the general public affected by COVID-19 prevention strategies.\n\n The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS) were used.\n\n\nResults\nThreat degree of COVID-19 (groups) had significant correlations with insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01).\n\n Age, gender, and area (Hubei province or other provinces) had significant correlations with insomnia (p &lt; 0.01).\n\n A total of 1380 (24.46%) participants were suspected of having major depression based on the PHQ-9. Additionally, 1042 (18.47%) participants were suspected of having generalized anxiety disorder based on the GAD-7. A total of 892 (15.8%) of the participants had Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) according to the ASDS.\n\n The prevalence of clinical insomnia during the outbreak was 20.05% (1131) according to the ISI.\n\n The factors of satisfaction with the current sleep pattern and how perceptible the symptoms of the current sleep pattern are to other people (p &lt; 0.05) and the middle (difficulty staying asleep) and terminal (waking up too early) (p &lt; 0.01) factors of the ISI were significantly different across groups.\n\n A total of 1129 (20.01%) participants spent more than one hour awake in bed.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe results indicated that insomnia is more severe in people who are female, young, living in the epicenter and experiencing a high degree of threat from COVID-19. As prevention and treatment efforts continue with regard to COVID-19, the general public has developed poor sleep hygiene habits, which deserve attention.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7831667","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Li-yu","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiao-yong","surname":"Ou-yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"Miao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Feng-xia","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yang-pu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early transmission dynamics in wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"An update on the epidemiological characteristics of novel coronavirus pneumoniaCOVID-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World health organization declares global emergency: a review of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): the epidemic and the challenges","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Wuhan novel coronavirus (COVID-19): why global control is challenging?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Mental health and coping styles of children and adolescent survivors one year after the 2008 Chinese earthquake","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Psychological health and resilience: the impact of significant earthquake events on tertiary level professional students.

coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2) in China, a total of 70 genomes of virus strains from China and elsewhere with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020 were analyzed.\n To explore the potential intermediate animal host of the SARS?CoV?2 virus, we reanalyzed virome data sets from pangolins and representative SARS?related coronaviruses isolates from bats, with particular attention paid to the spike glycoprotein gene.\n We performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission network, likelihood?mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes.\n Based on Bayesian time?scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip?dating method, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor and evolutionary rate of SARS?CoV?2, which ranged from 22 to 24 November 2019 and 1.19 to 1.31?×?10?3 substitutions per site per year, respectively.\n Our results also revealed that the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus was more similar to the SARS?CoV?2 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378).\n We also identified a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion in the human SARS?CoV?2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility.\n Interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the RRAR motif.\n Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS?CoV?2 virus, which is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID?19, did not come directly from pangolins.\n","id":"PMC7228310","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xingguang","surname":"Li","email":"xingguanglee@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junjie","surname":"Zai","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Junjie","surname":"Zai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qiang","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"Nie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Li","email":"yujp@wh.iov.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Brian

254 families participating in an ongoing study completed an online survey that included close and open-ended questions.\n Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the quantitative data and qualitative responses were analyzed using thematic analysis.\n More than half of our sample reported that their eating and meal routines have changed since COVID-19; most commonly reported changes were eating more snack foods and spending more time cooking.\n Screen time increased among 74% of mothers, 61% of fathers, and 87% of children and physical activity decreased among 59% of mothers, 52% of fathers, and 52% of children.\n Key factors influencing family stress include balancing work with childcare/homeschooling and financial instability.\n While some unhealthful behaviors appeared to have been exacerbated, other more healthful behaviors also emerged since COVID-19. Research is needed to determine the longer-term impact of the pandemic on behaviors and to identify effective strategies to support families in the post-COVID-19 context.\n","id":"PMC7468859","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicholas","surname":"Carroll","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Adam","surname":"Sadowski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amar","surname":"Laila","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Valerie","surname":"Hruska","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Madeline","surname":"Nixon","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Madeline","surname":"Nixon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David W.L.","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jess","surname":"Haines","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jess","surname":"Haines","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.2105/AJPH.2005.080754","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The effect of school on overweight in childhood: Gain in body mass index during the school year and during summer vacation","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.7717/peerj.5172","date":"1970-06-16","title":"Exercise can improve sleep quality: a systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Background\nInsomnia is common.\n\n However, no systematic reviews have examined the effect of exercise on patients with primary and secondary insomnia, defined as both sleep disruption and daytime impairment.\n\n This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effectiveness/efficacy of exercise in patients with insomnia.\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov to identify all randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of exercise on various sleep parameters in patients with insomnia.\n\n All participants were diagnosed with insomnia, using standard diagnostic criteria or predetermined criteria and standard measures.\n\n Data on outcome measures were subjected to meta-analyses using random-effects models.\n\n The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach were used to assess the quality of the individual studies and the body of evidence, respectively.\n\n\nResults\nWe included nine studies with a total of 557 participants.\n\n According to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (mean difference [MD], 2.87 points lower in the intervention group;

This disruption in individuals’ daily routines likely altered food consumption habits.\n We examined how changes in food choice motives related to changes in nutritional quality during the lockdown compared to before.\n A convenience sample of 938 French adults completed online questionnaires on the Qualtrics platform at the end of April 2020. Participants were retrospectively asked about their food choice motives and food consumption during the month before and in the first month of the lockdown.\n The importance of nine food choice motives was assessed: health, convenience, sensory appeal, natural content, ethical concern, weight control, mood, familiarity, and price, scoring from 1 to 4. Food intakes were recorded using a food frequency questionnaire including 110 foods, 12 non-alcoholic beverages and 4 alcoholic beverages.\n Adherence to the French dietary recommendations before and during the lockdown was estimated using the simplified PNNS-GS2, scoring from ?17 to 11.5. The nutritional quality of diet was lower during the lockdown compared to before (?0.32, SD 2.28, p &lt; 0.001).\n Food choice motives significantly changed and an increase in the importance of weight control was associated with increased nutritional quality (? = 0.89, p &lt; 0.001, partial ?2 = 0.032), whereas an increase in the importance of mood was associated with decreased nutritional quality (? = ?0.43, p = 0.021, partial ?2 = 0.006).\n The lockdown period in France was related to a decrease in nutritional quality of diet on average, which could be partly explained by changes in food choice motives.\n The lockdown was indeed related to modification of food choice motives, notably with an increase of mood as a food choice motive for 48% of the participants, but also with an increase of health (26%), ethical concern (21%) and natural content (19%) suggesting a growing awareness of the importance of sustainable food choices in some participants.\n","id":"PMC7558232","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lucile","surname":"Marty","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Blandine","surname":"de

2017","abstract":"Background\nSuboptimal diet is an important preventable risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs); however, its impact on the burden of NCDs has not been systematically evaluated.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the consumption of major foods and nutrients across 195 countries and to quantify the impact of their suboptimal intake on NCD mortality and morbidity.\n\n\nMethods\nBy use of a comparative risk assessment approach, we estimated the proportion of disease-specific burden attributable to each dietary risk factor (also referred to as population attributable fraction) among adults aged 25 years or older.\n\n The main inputs to this analysis included the intake of each dietary factor, the effect size of the dietary factor on disease endpoint, and the level of intake associated with the lowest risk of mortality.\n\n Then, by use of disease-specific population attributable fractions, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), we calculated the number of deaths and DALYs attributable to diet for each disease outcome.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2017, 11 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 10–12) deaths and 255 million (234–274) DALYs were attributable to dietary risk factors.\n\n High intake of sodium (3 million [1–5] deaths and 70 million [34–118] DALYs), low intake of whole grains (3 million [2–4] deaths and 82 million [59–109] DALYs), and low intake of fruits (2 million [1–4] deaths and 65 million [41–92] DALYs) were the leading dietary risk factors for deaths and DALYs globally and in many countries.\n\n Dietary data were from mixed sources and were not available for all countries, increasing the statistical uncertainty of our estimates.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis study provides a comprehensive picture of the potential impact of suboptimal diet on NCD mortality and morbidity, highlighting the need for improving diet across nations.\n\n Our findings will inform implementation of evidence-based dietary interventions and provide a platform for evaluation of their impact on human health annually.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates

and physical activity level, must be examined and accounted for before drawing conclusions about intake.\n Methods that may be used to account for plausibility of rEI include crude methods such as excluding participants reporting EIs at the extremes of a range of intake and individualized methods such as statistical adjustment and applying cutoffs that account for the errors associated with within-participant variation in EI and total energy expenditure (TEE).\n These approaches allow researchers to determine how accounting for under- and overreporting affects study results and to appropriately address misreporting in drawing conclusions with data collected and in interpreting reported research.\n In selecting a procedure to assess and account for plausibility of intake, there are a number of key considerations, such as resources available, the dietary-report instrument, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each method.\n While additional studies are warranted to recommend one procedure as superior to another, researchers should apply one of the available methods to address the issue of implausible rEI.\n If no method is applied, then at minimum, mean TEE or

label according to individual characteristics of subjects: Comparisons with other format labels","abstract":"Background\nTo improve nutritional status and prevent chronic nutrition-related diseases, international organizations have recommended the use of multiple strategies, including front-of-package nutrition labelling (FOPL).\n\n In France, the Nutri-Score has been selected by health authorities in March 2017. However, to be effective in purchasing situations, the label needs to be well understood, which may be influenced by label format and sociodemographic characteristics.\n\n This study aimed at investigating the objective understanding of the Nutri-Score compared to other label formats, and more particularly among specific at-risk populations.\n\n\nMethods\nThe objective understanding of four FOPLs—namely Nutri-Score, Multiple Traffic Lights (MTL), the simplified nutrition labelling system (SENS), and modified Reference Intakes (mRIs)—was investigated in a sample from the NutriNet-Santé French cohort (n = 3,751).\n\n Logistic regression mixed models were computed to assess the association of the four FOPLs, compared to a “no label” situation, on the consumers’ ability to rank products according to their overall nutritional quality.\n\n Objective understanding was also investigated according to sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics.\n\n\nResults\nCompared to a “no label” situation, all FOPLs were significantly associated to an increase in consumers’ ability to classify the products correctly, with wide disparities in results according to formats.\n\n The best performance was observed for the Nutri-Score (OR = 20.33(17.68–23.37)), followed by SENS (OR = 9.57(8.50–10.77)), MTL (OR = 3.55(3.20–3.93)) and mRIs (OR = 1.53(1.39–1.69)).\n\n This ranking was similar among all sub-populations and the ORs associated to the Nutri-Score were over 10, whichever the sub-group considered.\n\n Women, younger people, non-smokers, individuals with higher educational level and those with children had a higher capacity to identify healthier products (all P?0.05).\n\n\nConclusion\nNutri-Score, with a summarized graded and color-coded format, using semantic colours, is associated to a higher objective understanding than monochrome and nutrient-specific labels.\n\n Furthermore, though objective understanding may differ according to individual characteristics of subjects, the magnitude of effect of the Nutri-Score largely outweighed this effect, even in the at-risk populations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6107140","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Manon","surname":"Egnell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pauline","surname":"Ducrot","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Pauline","surname":"Ducrot","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mathilde","surname":"Touvier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin","surname":"Allès","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Serge","surname":"Hercberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Emmanuelle","surname":"Kesse-Guyot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chantal","surname":"Julia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David

quality of diets in the US: evidence from a nationally representative cross-sectional study","abstract":"Background\nRecent population dietary studies indicate that diets rich in ultra-processed foods, increasingly frequent worldwide, are grossly nutritionally unbalanced, suggesting that the dietary contribution of these foods largely determines the overall nutritional quality of contemporaneous diets.\n\n Yet, these studies have focused on individual nutrients (one at a time) rather than the overall nutritional quality of the diets.\n\n Here we investigate the relationship between the energy contribution of ultra-processed foods in the US diet and its content of critical nutrients, individually and overall.\n\n\nMethods\nWe evaluated dietary intakes of 9,317 participants from 2009 to 2010 NHANES aged 1+ years.\n\n Food items were classified into unprocessed or minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, processed foods, and ultra-processed foods.\n\n First, we examined the average dietary content of macronutrients, micronutrients, and fiber across quintiles of the energy contribution of ultra-processed foods.\n\n Then, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify a nutrient-balanced dietary pattern to enable the assessment of the overall nutritional quality of the diet.\n\n Linear regression was used to explore the association between the dietary share of ultra-processed foods and the balanced-pattern PCA factor score.\n\n The scores were thereafter categorized into tertiles, and their distribution was examined across ultra-processed food quintiles.\n\n All models incorporated survey sample weights and were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, and educational attainment.\n\n\nResults\nThe average content of protein, fiber, vitamins A, C, D, and E, zinc, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium in the US diet decreased significantly across quintiles of the energy contribution of ultra-processed foods, while carbohydrate, added sugar, and saturated fat contents increased.\n\n An inverse dose–response association was found between ultra-processed food quintiles and overall dietary quality measured through a nutrient-balanced-pattern PCA-derived factor score characterized by being richer in fiber, potassium, magnesium and vitamin C, and having less saturated fat and added sugars.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study suggests that decreasing the dietary share of ultra-processed foods is a rational and effective way to improve the nutritional quality of US diets.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12963-017-0119-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

lifestyle and activity behaviours vary across levels of motivation to eat a healthy diet with a view to informing health promotion interventions.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey of food intake, physical activity, lifestyles and food choice attitudes was conducted in a nationally representative sample of 1262 adults in the Republic of Ireland aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nResults\nIncreasing score for health motivation was significantly and positively related to healthy eating and exercise.\n\n Women, increasing age, normal BMI, regular exercise and increasing intakes of fruit and vegetables were associated with a higher odds ratio (OR) for having a high healthy eating motivation score.\n\n However, despite a high motivation score only 31 % of consumers in the strong motivation group achieved the recommendations for daily fruit and vegetable consumption, while 57 % achieved the fat recommendation.\n\n A higher intake of calorie dense foods from the top shelf of the food pyramid and increased time spent watching T.\n\nV.\n\n was associated with a decreased OR for positive motivation towards healthy eating.\n\n\nConclusions\nHealthy eating promotions directed at women

eating promotions will need to address the issues underlying their weak attitudes towards healthy

with emerging diseases and epidemics are rarely examined and sometimes, even eschewed due to cultural considerations.\n Psychiatric manifestations of various infectious diseases, especially with a focus on Ebola Virus disease (EVD) and Zika Virus, are discussed in this commentary to illustrate the continued need of care after the resolution of the actual illness.\n Various infectious diseases have associations with mental illness, such as an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorders and Tourette syndrome in children with Group B streptococcal infection.\n Current EVD literature does not demonstrate a strong association of mental illness symptoms or diseases but there is a necessity of care that extends beyond the illness.\n Patients and their families experience depression, anxiety, trauma, suicidal ideation, panic and other manifestations.\n Zika virus has been associated neuronal injury, genetic alteration that affects fetal development and detrimental maternal mental health symptoms are being documented.\n While funding calls from the international community are present, there are no specific epidemiological data or fiscal estimates solely for mental health during or after infectious diseases epidemics or disasters that support health care providers and strengthen policies and procedures for responding to such situations.\n Therefore, those on the frontlines of epidemics including emergency physicians, primary care providers and infectious disease specialists should serve communicate this need and advocate for sustained and increased funding for mental health programs to heighten public awareness regarding acute psychiatric events during infectious diseases outbreaks and offer treatment and support when necessary.\n","id":"PMC5750439","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Veronica","surname":"Tucci","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nidal","surname":"Moukaddam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jonathan","surname":"Meadows","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Suhal","surname":"Shah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sagar

stigma, despite its salience for public health and stigma research, has had little examination.\n This study combines survey and case study methods to examine subjective stigma among residents of Amoy Gardens (AG), the first officially recognized site of community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong.\n A total of 903 residents of AG completed a self-report questionnaire derived from two focus groups conducted toward the end of the 3-month outbreak.\n Case studies of two residents who lived in Block E, the heart of the SARS epidemic at AG, complement the survey data.\n Findings show that stigma affected most residents and took various forms of being shunned, insulted, marginalized, and rejected in the domains of work, interpersonal relationships, use of services and schooling.\n Stigma was also associated with psychosomatic distress.\n Residents’ strategies for diminishing stigma varied with gender, age, education, occupation, and proximity to perceived risk factors for SARS such as residential location, previous SARS infection and the presence of ex-SARS household members.\n Residents attributed stigma to government mismanagement, contagiousness of the mysterious SARS virus, and alarmist media reporting.\n Stigma clearly decreased, but never completely disappeared, after the outbreak.\n The findings confirm and add to existing knowledge on the varied origins, correlates, and impacts of stigma.\n They also highlight the synergistic roles of inconsistent health policy responses and risk miscommunication by the media in rapidly amplifying stigma toward an unfamiliar illness.\n While recognizing the intrinsically stigmatizing nature of public health measures to control SARS, we recommend that a consistent inter-sectoral approach is needed to minimize stigma and to make an effective health response to future outbreaks.\n","id":"PMC7116975","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sing","surname":"Lee","email":"singlee@cuhk.edu.hk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lydia

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience.\n Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic.\n The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n The data will be used for future reference.\n Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques.\n The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/gpsych-2020-100213","date":"2020-02-29","title":"A nationwide survey of psychological distress among Chinese people in the COVID-19 epidemic: implications and policy recommendations","abstract":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic emerged in Wuhan, China, spread nationwide and then onto half a dozen other countries between December 2019 and early 2020.

February.\n By 9th April 2020 Spain was the second country in confirmed cases and in deaths.\n On March 14, 2020, the Spanish Government declared the state of alarm to limit viral transmission.\n During such state, citizens must stay confined at home with few justified exceptions.\n This whole situation drastically changed the life of the population, which can cause a wide range of psychosocial impacts.\n This study explored the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general adult population (N = 3055) during the first stages of the outbreak in Spain, as well as their anxiety, stress and depression levels.\n We also examined the extent to which the following variables were associated to participants’ mental health: (1) demographics; (2) degree of concern about the pandemic; (3) environmental conditions during the home confinement, (4) changes in daily life as a consequence of the pandemic; (5) contact with the COVID-19 disease; (6) actual and perceived severity of the crisis; (7) information about the COVID-19, (8) perceived health status and (9) leisure activities conducted within the last 24 h.\n Our results show that Spanish consider the current COVID-19 health crisis as fairly severe, and the majority felt that the COVID-19 crisis had greatly impacted on their daily life, including changes in their daily routines and cancelation of important activities.\n About 36% of the participants reported moderate to severe psychological impact, 25% showed mild to severe levels of anxiety, 41% reported depressive symptoms, and 41% felt stressed.\n Women, young, and those who that lost their job during the health crisis showed the strongest negative psychological symptoms.\n What worried Spaniards the most was the likelihood of suffering an economic crisis derived from the pandemic.\n We found factors associated with better mental health, such as being satisfied with the information received about the health crisis, conducting leisure activities, and the perception of being in good health.\n These findings can be used to design psychological interventions to help coping with COVID-19 pandemic, both in Spain and other countries.\n","id":"PMC7325630","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rocío","surname":"Rodríguez-Rey","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Helena","surname":"Garrido-Hernansaiz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Silvia","surname":"Collado","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References

novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of

lessons to the next lethal viral epidemic that occurs.\n\n\nMethod\nThe 1995 Kikwit Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formally Zaire) is one of the most well studied epidemics to have occurred to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nWhen an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered.\n\n Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities.\n\n The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral lessons from the outbreak include the importance of having simple, well-defined triage procedures; staff who are flexible and able to adapt to situations with unknowns; and the need to protect staff physically and emotionally to ensure a sustained effort to provide care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7132410","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ryan C.W.","surname":"Hall","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard

A population-based survey of adult survivors of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake","abstract":"Background\nThe association between ages and psychological impact of natural disasters has not been well characterized.\n\n A population-based study was conducted 15 months after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake to assess whether elderly survivors were more likely to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and general psychiatric morbidity.\n\n\nMethods\nA population-based survey of 327 survivors (152 elders, 175 younger adults) was conducted in severely affected areas by the earthquake, using a multi-stage systematic sampling design.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with the younger adult survivors, the elderly were more likely to have symptoms of PTSD (22.5% vs.\n\n 8.0%, p = 0.001) and general psychiatric morbidity (42.0% vs.\n\n 25.4%, p = 0.003).\n\n Risk factors, such as being elderly, having been in serious danger, having lost family members, and having felt guilt concerning one's death or injury were significantly associated with developing PTSD; being elderly, having family members or friends seriously injured, and having felt guilt concerning one's death or injury were significantly associated with developing general psychiatric morbidity.\n\n Utilization of mental health services is strongly associated with the decreased risk for developing both of the symptoms.\n\n\nConclusion\nCompared with the younger adults, the elderly survivors were more likely to develop PTSD and general psychiatric morbidity.\n\n More mental health services should be distributed to the elderly and groups at particular risk, to ensure their smooth mental health reconstruction after the

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern","abstract":"","id":"PMC7135038","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"cyh-birm@263.net","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter W","surname":"Horby","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick G","surname":"Hayden","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1007.030703","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS Control and Psychological Effects of Quarantine, Toronto, Canada","abstract":"Explores effects of quarantine on those quarantined for SARS, Toronto, Canada","id":"PMC3323345","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Hawryluck","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wayne L.","surname":"Gold","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Robinson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Pogorski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sandro","surname":"Galea","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rima","surname":"Styra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/jcm9020330","date":"2020-01-23","title":"The Extent of Transmission of Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, 2020","abstract":"A cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported by China in late December 2019.

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth.\n The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation.\n We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0.\n Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.\n The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403–540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18–25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.\n We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49–2.63).\n Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.\n","id":"PMC7074332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinjun","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangpu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daozhou","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

and Psychological Well-Being of Individuals in Times of a Major Air Pollution Crisis","abstract":"Background\nCrisis situations bring about many challenges to researchers, public institutions, and governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire.\n\n Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access.\n\n\nIn addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6).\n\n The total Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n The perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level and the number of physical symptoms were associated with higher IES-R Score (P&lt;.\n\n05).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis is one of the first few studies demonstrating the use of Internet in data collection during an air-pollution crisis.\n\n Our results demonstrated that the newer technological modalities have the potential to acquire data, similar to that of conventional technologies.\n\n Demographic variables did not influence the mechanism of usage.\n\n In addition, our findings also suggested that there are acute physical and psychological impacts on the population from an air-pollution crisis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4114481","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sary","surname":"Beidas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sary","surname":"Beidas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fernando","surname":"Mora","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Monica","surname":"Murero","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Melvyn

trackers can help motivate you during workouts and provide information about your daily routine or fitness in combination with your smartphone without requiring potentially disruptive manual calculations or records.\n\n This paper summarizes and compares wearable fitness devices, also called “fitness trackers” or “activity trackers.\n\n” These devices are becoming increasingly popular in personal healthcare, motivating people to exercise more throughout the day without the need for lifestyle changes.\n\n The various choices in the market for wearable devices are also increasing, with customers searching for products that best suit their personal needs.\n\n Further, using a wearable device or fitness tracker can help people reach a fitness goal or finish line.\n\n Generally, companies display advertising for these kinds of products and depict them as beneficial, user friendly, and accurate.\n\n However, there are no objective research results to prove the veracity of their words.\n\n This research features subjective and objective experimental results, which reveal that some devices perform better than others.\n\n\nMethods\nThe four most popular wristband style wearable devices currently on the market (Withings Pulse, Misfit Shine, Jawbone Up24, and Fitbit Flex) are selected and compared.\n\n The accuracy of fitness tracking is one of the key components for fitness tracking, and some devices perform better than others.\n\n This research shows subjective and objective experimental results that are used to compare the accuracy of four wearable devices in conjunction with user friendliness and satisfaction of 7 real users.\n\n In addition, this research matches the opinions between reviewers on an Internet site and those of subjects when using the

important measurement of fitness tracking, followed by Fitbit Flex, Jawbone Up24, and Misfit Shine.\n\n In contrast, Misfit Shine has the highest score for design and hardware, which is also appreciated by users.\n\n\nConclusions\nFrom the results of experiments on four wearable devices, it is determined that the most acceptable in terms of price and satisfaction levels is the Withings

activities, but produced similar free-living estimates to the Apple Watch.\n Both these devices underestimated free-living energy expenditure (-394 kcal/d and -405 kcal/d, respectively; P&lt;0.01).\n The multi-sensor Microsoft Band and accelerometry-only Jawbone UP24 devices underestimated most laboratory activities and substantially underestimated free-living expenditure (-1128 kcal/d and -998 kcal/d, respectively; P&lt;0.01).\n None of the consumer devices were deemed equivalent to the reference method for daily energy expenditure.\n For all devices, there was a tendency for negative bias with greater daily energy expenditure.\n No consumer monitors performed as well as the research-grade devices although in some (but not all) cases, estimates were close to criterion measurements.\n Thus, whilst industry-led innovation has improved the accuracy of consumer monitors, these devices are not yet equivalent to the best research-grade devices or indeed equivalent to each other.\n We propose independent quality standards and/or accuracy ratings for consumer devices are required.\n","id":"PMC5325221","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Enhad

Analysis","abstract":"Background\nWearable activity trackers are promising as interventions that offer guidance and support for increasing physical activity and health-focused tracking.\n\n Most adults do not meet their recommended daily activity guidelines, and wearable fitness trackers are increasingly cited as having great potential to improve the physical activity levels of adults.\n\n\nObjective\nThe objective of this study was to use the Coventry, Aberdeen, and London-Refined (CALO-RE) taxonomy to examine if the design of wearable activity trackers incorporates behavior change techniques (BCTs).\n\n A secondary objective was to critically analyze whether the BCTs present relate to known drivers of behavior change, such as self-efficacy, with the intention of extending applicability to older adults in addition to the overall population.\n\n\nMethods\nWearing each device for a period of 1 week, two independent raters used CALO-RE taxonomy to code the BCTs of the seven wearable activity trackers available in Canada as of March 2014. These included Fitbit Flex, Misfit Shine, Withings Pulse, Jawbone UP24, Spark Activity Tracker by SparkPeople, Nike+ FuelBand SE, and Polar Loop.\n\n We calculated interrater reliability using Cohen's kappa.\n\n\nResults\nThe average number of BCTs identified was 16.3/40. Withings Pulse had the highest number of BCTs and Misfit Shine had the lowest.\n\n Most techniques centered around self-monitoring and self-regulation, all of which have been associated with improved physical activity in older adults.\n\n Techniques related to planning and providing instructions were scarce.\n\n\nConclusions\nOverall, wearable activity trackers contain several BCTs that have been shown to increase physical activity in older adults.\n\n Although more research and development must be done to fully understand the potential of wearables as health interventions, the current wearable trackers offer significant potential with regard to BCTs relevant to uptake by all populations, including older adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4917727","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elizabeth","surname":"Lyons","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Elizabeth","surname":"Lyons","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andre","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kathryn","surname":"Mercer","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Kathryn","surname":"Mercer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Melissa","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Melissa","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lora","surname":"Giangregorio","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Lora","surname":"Giangregorio","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Catherine","surname":"Burns","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Catherine","surname":"Burns","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelly","surname":"Grindrod","email":"kelly.grindrod@uwaterloo.ca","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelly","surname":"Grindrod","email":"kelly.grindrod@uwaterloo.ca","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.2196/mhealth.7647","date":"2017-05-11","title":"A

physical activity (MVPA) per day, with leisure time being increasingly allocated to technology usage.\n\n Direct-to-consumer mHealth devices that promote physical activity, such as wrist-worn physical activity trackers, have features with potential appeal to youth.\n\n\nObjective\nThe primary purpose of this study was to determine whether a minimalist physical activity tracker-based intervention would lead to an increase in physical activity in young adolescents.\n\n A secondary aim of this study was to assess change in physical activity across a 7-week intervention, as measured by the tracker.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing a quasi-experimental crossover design, two groups of 23 young adolescents (aged 13-14 years) were randomly assigned to immediate intervention or delayed intervention.\n\n The intervention consisted of wearing a Fitbit-Charge-HR physical activity tracker over a 7-week period.\n\n Actical accelerometers were used to measure participants’ levels of MVPA before and at the end of intervention periods for each group.\n\n Covariates such as age, sex, stage of change for physical activity behavior, and goal commitment were also measured.\n\n\nResults\nThere was an increase in physical activity over the course of the study period, though it was not related to overall physical activity tracker use.\n\n An intervention response did, however, occur in a subset of participants.\n\n Specifically, exposure to the physical activity tracker was associated with an average daily increase in MVPA by more than 15 minutes (P=.\n\n01) among participants who reported being in the action and maintenance stages of behavior change in relation to participation in physical activity.\n\n Participants in the precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation stages of behavior change had no change in their level of MVPA (P=.\n\n81).\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results suggest that physical activity trackers may elicit improved physical activity related behavior in young adolescents demonstrating a readiness to be active.\n\n Future studies should seek to investigate if integrating physical activity trackers as part of more intensive interventions leads to greater increases in physical activity across different levels of stages of behavior change and if these changes can be sustained over longer periods of time.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5519831","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Casimiro","surname":"Dias","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julie","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Julie","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kisha","surname":"Coa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jeffrey","surname":"Gaudet","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jeffrey","surname":"Gaudet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"François","surname":"Gallant","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"François","surname":"Gallant","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mathieu","surname":"Bélanger","email":"mathieu.f.belanger@usherbrooke.ca","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Mathieu","surname":"Bélanger","email":"mathieu.f.belanger@usherbrooke.ca","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/chd.12330","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Can

A Comparative Study of Step Counts in Low-Intensity Physical Activities","abstract":"Background\nAs commercially available activity trackers are being utilized in clinical trials, the research community remains uncertain about reliability of the trackers, particularly in studies that involve walking aids and low-intensity activities.\n\n While these trackers have been tested for reliability during walking and running activities, there has been limited research on validating them during low-intensity activities and walking with assistive tools.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to (1) determine the accuracy of 3 Fitbit devices (ie, Zip, One, and Flex) at different wearing positions (ie, pants pocket, chest, and wrist) during walking at 3 different speeds, 2.5, 5, and 8 km/h, performed by healthy adults on a treadmill; (2) determine the accuracy of the mentioned trackers worn at different sites during activities of daily living; and (3) examine whether intensity of physical activity (PA) impacts the choice of optimal wearing site of the tracker.\n\n\nMethods\nWe recruited 15 healthy young adults to perform 6 PAs while wearing 3 Fitbit devices (ie, Zip, One, and Flex) on their chest, pants pocket, and wrist.\n\n The activities include walking at 2.5, 5, and 8 km/h, pushing a shopping cart, walking with aid of a walker, and eating while sitting.\n\n We compared the number of steps counted by each tracker with gold standard numbers.\n\n We performed multiple statistical analyses to compute descriptive statistics (ie, ANOVA test), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), mean absolute error rate, and correlation by comparing the tracker-recorded data with that of the gold standard.\n\n\nResults\nAll the 3 trackers demonstrated good-to-excellent (ICC&gt;0.75) correlation with the gold standard step counts during treadmill experiments.\n\n The correlation was poor (ICC&lt;0.60), and the error rate was significantly higher in walker experiment compared to other activities.\n\n There was no significant difference between the trackers and the gold standard in the shopping cart experiment.\n\n The wrist worn tracker, Flex, counted several steps when eating (P&lt;.\n\n01).\n\n The chest tracker was identified as the most promising site to capture steps in more intense activities, while the wrist was the optimal wearing site in less intense activities.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis feasibility study focused on 6 PAs and demonstrated that Fitbit trackers were most accurate when walking on a treadmill and least accurate during walking with a walking aid and for low-intensity activities.\n\n This may suggest excluding participants with assistive devices from studies that focus on PA interventions using commercially available trackers.\n\n This study also indicates that the wearing site of the tracker is an important factor impacting the accuracy performance.\n\n A larger scale study with a more diverse population, various activity tracker vendors, and a larger activity set are warranted to generalize our results.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5572056","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Glance","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Glance","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sjaan","surname":"Gomersall","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charlotte","surname":"Thorup","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Parastoo","surname":"Alinia","email":"parastoo.alinia@wsu.edu","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Parastoo","surname":"Alinia","email":"parastoo.alinia@wsu.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chris","surname":"Cain","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chris","surname":"Cain","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ramin","surname":"Fallahzadeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ramin","surname":"Fallahzadeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Armin","surname":"Shahrokni","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Armin","surname":"Shahrokni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Diane","surname":"Cook","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Diane","surname":"Cook","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hassan","surname":"Ghasemzadeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Hassan","surname":"Ghasemzadeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3389/fneur.2017.00160","date":"2017-04-05","title":"Improved Mental Acuity Forecasting with an Individualized Quantitative Sleep Model","abstract":"Sleep impairment significantly alters human brain structure and cognitive function, but available evidence suggests that adults in developed nations are sleeping less.\n A growing body of research has sought to use sleep to forecast cognitive performance by modeling the relationship between the two, but has generally focused on vigilance rather than other cognitive constructs affected by sleep, such as reaction time, executive function, and working memory.\n Previous modeling efforts have also utilized subjective, self-reported sleep durations and were restricted to laboratory environments.\n In the current effort, we addressed these limitations by employing wearable systems and mobile applications to gather objective sleep information, assess multi-construct cognitive performance, and model/predict changes to mental acuity.\n Thirty participants were recruited for participation in the study, which lasted 1?week.\n Using the Fitbit Charge HR and a mobile version of the automated neuropsychological assessment metric called CogGauge, we gathered a series of features and utilized the unified model of performance to predict mental acuity based on sleep records.\n Our results suggest that individuals poorly rate their sleep duration, supporting the need for objective sleep metrics to model circadian changes to mental acuity.\n Participant compliance in using the wearable throughout the week and responding to the CogGauge assessments was 80%.\n Specific biases were identified in temporal metrics across mobile devices and operating systems and were excluded from the mental acuity metric development.\n Individualized prediction of mental acuity consistently outperformed group modeling.\n This effort indicates the feasibility of creating an individualized, mobile assessment and prediction of mental acuity, compatible with the majority of current mobile

Groups","abstract":"Background\nOnly one in five American meets the physical activity recommendations of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n The proliferation of wearable devices and smartphones for physical activity tracking has led to an increasing number of interventions designed to facilitate regular physical activity, in particular to address the obesity epidemic, but also for cardiovascular disease patients, cancer survivors, and older adults.\n\n However, the inconsistent findings pertaining to the accuracy of wearable devices for step counting needs to be addressed, as well as factors known to affect gait (and thus potentially impact accuracy) such as age, body mass index (BMI), or leading arm.\n\n\nObjective\nWe aim to assess the accuracy of recent mobile devices for counting steps, across three different age groups.\n\n\nMethods\nWe recruited 60 participants in three age groups: 18-39 years, 40-64 years, and 65-84 years, who completed two separate 1000 step walks on a treadmill at a self-selected speed between 2 and 3 miles per hour.\n\n We tested two smartphones attached on each side of the waist, and five wrist-based devices worn on both wrists (2 devices on one wrist and 3 devices on the other), as well as the Actigraph wGT3X-BT, and swapped sides between each walk.\n\n All devices were swapped dominant-to-nondominant side and vice-versa between the two 1000 step walks.\n\n The number of steps was recorded with a tally counter.\n\n Age, sex, height, weight, and dominant hand were self-reported by each participant.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 60 participants, 36 were female (60%) and 54 were right-handed (90%).\n\n Median age was 53 years (min=19, max=83), median BMI was 24.1 (min=18.4, max=39.6).\n\n There was no significant difference in left- and right-hand step counts by device.\n\n Our analyses show that the Fitbit Surge significantly undercounted steps across all age groups.\n\n Samsung Gear S2 significantly undercounted steps only for participants among the 40-64 year age group.\n\n Finally, the Nexus 6P significantly undercounted steps for the group ranging from 65-84 years.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur analysis shows that apart from the Fitbit Surge, most of the recent mobile devices we tested do not overcount or undercount steps in the 18-39-year-old age group, however some devices undercount steps in older age groups.\n\n This finding suggests that accuracy in step counting may be an issue with some popular wearable devices, and that age may be a factor in undercounting.\n\n These results are particularly important for clinical interventions using such devices and other activity trackers, in particular to balance energy requirements with energy expenditure in the context of a weight loss intervention program.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5508112","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianbo","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jianbo","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephanie","surname":"Schoeppe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"François","surname":"Modave","email":"modavefp@ufl.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"François","surname":"Modave","email":"modavefp@ufl.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiang","surname":"Bian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiang","surname":"Bian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew

measuring steps in the laboratory and against the Actigraph for step counts in free-living conditions and for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and activity energy expenditure (AEE) overall.\n\n\nMethods\nTwenty-five adults (12 females, 13 males) wore a Fitbit Flex and an Actigraph GT3X+ during a laboratory based protocol (including walking, incline walking, running and stepping) and free-living conditions during a single day period to examine measurement of steps, AEE and MVPA.\n\n Twenty-four of the participants attended a second session using the same protocol.\n\n\nResults\nIntraclass correlations (ICC) for test-retest reliability of the Fitbit Flex were strong for walking (ICC = 0.57), moderate for stair stepping (ICC = 0.34), and weak for incline walking (ICC = 0.22) and jogging (ICC = 0.26).\n\n The Fitbit significantly undercounted walking steps in the laboratory (absolute proportional difference: 21.2%, 95%CI 13.0–29.4%), but it was more accurate, despite slightly over counting, for both jogging (6.4%, 95%CI 3.7–9.0%) and stair stepping (15.5%, 95%CI 10.1–20.9%).\n\n The Fitbit had higher coefficients of variation (Cv) for step counts compared to direct observation and the Actigraph.\n\n In free-living conditions, the average MVPA minutes were lower in the Fitbit (35.4 minutes) compared to the Actigraph (54.6 minutes), but AEE was greater from the Fitbit (808.1 calories) versus the Actigraph (538.9 calories).\n\n The coefficients of variation were similar for AEE for the Actigraph (Cv = 36.0) and Fitbit (Cv = 35.0), but lower in the Actigraph (Cv = 25.5) for MVPA against the Fitbit (Cv = 32.7).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe Fitbit Flex has moderate validity for measuring physical activity relative to direct observation and

Position on Pedometer Accuracy at Various Walking Speeds: A Comparative Study","abstract":"Background\nDemographic growth in conjunction with the rise of chronic diseases is increasing the pressure on health care systems in most OECD countries.\n\n Physical activity is known to be an essential factor in improving or maintaining good health.\n\n Walking is especially recommended, as it is an activity that can easily be performed by most people without constraints.\n\n Pedometers have been extensively used as an incentive to motivate people to become more active.\n\n However, a recognized problem with these devices is their diminishing accuracy associated with decreased walking speed.\n\n The arrival on the consumer market of new devices, worn indifferently either at the waist, wrist, or as a necklace, gives rise to new questions regarding their accuracy at these different positions.\n\n\nObjective\nOur objective was to assess the performance of 4 pedometers (iHealth activity monitor, Withings Pulse O2, Misfit Shine, and Garmin vívofit) and compare their accuracy according to their position worn, and at various walking speeds.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted this study in a controlled environment with 21 healthy adults required to walk 100 m at 3 different paces (0.4 m/s, 0.6 m/s, and 0.8 m/s) regulated by means of a string attached between their legs at the level of their ankles and a metronome ticking the cadence.\n\n To obtain baseline values, we asked the participants to walk 200 m at their own pace.\n\n\nResults\nA decrease of accuracy was positively correlated with reduced speed for all pedometers (12% mean error at self-selected pace, 27% mean error at 0.8 m/s, 52% mean error at 0.6 m/s, and 76% mean error at 0.4 m/s).\n\n Although the position of the pedometer on the person did not significantly influence its accuracy, some interesting tendencies can be highlighted in 2 settings: (1) positioning the pedometer at the waist at a speed greater than 0.8 m/s or as a necklace at preferred speed tended to produce lower mean errors than at the wrist position; and (2) at a slow speed (0.4 m/s), pedometers worn at the wrist tended to produce a lower mean error than in the other positions.\n\n\nConclusions\nAt all positions, all tested pedometers generated significant errors at slow speeds and therefore cannot be used reliably to evaluate the amount of physical activity for people walking slower than 0.6 m/s (2.16 km/h, or 1.24 mph).\n\n At slow speeds, the better accuracy observed with pedometers worn at the wrist could constitute a valuable line of inquiry for the future development of devices adapted to elderly people.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5073206","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lena","surname":"Griebel","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lena","surname":"Griebel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosanne","surname":"Freak-Poli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pamela","surname":"Elliott","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frederic","surname":"Ehrler","email":"frederic.ehrler@hcuge.ch","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Frederic","surname":"Ehrler","email":"frederic.ehrler@hcuge.ch","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chloé","surname":"Weber","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chloé","surname":"Weber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Lovis","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Lovis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1515/hukin-2015-0170","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The

grass, gravel, ceramic tile, tarmacadam/asphalt, linoleum), when wearing both running shoes and hard-soled dress shoes.\n\n\nConclusion\nAll activity monitors tested were accurate in their step detection sensitivity and are valid monitors for physical activity quantification over the variety of different surfaces tested, when wearing both running shoes and hard-soled dress shoes, and over a timeframe necessary for accumulating the recommended daily step count of 10,000 steps.\n\n However, it is important to consider the accuracy of activity monitors, particularly when physical activity in the form of stepping activities is prescribed as an intervention in the treatment or prevention of a disease state.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4864247","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sandra","surname":"O’Connell","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Gearóid","surname":"ÓLaighin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lisa","surname":"Kelly","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elaine","surname":"Murphy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sorcha","surname":"Beirne","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Niall","surname":"Burke","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Orlaith","surname":"Kilgannon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leo

increase the risk of chronic illness and death.\n\n The newest generation of “wearable” activity trackers offers potential as a multifaceted intervention to help people become more active.\n\n\nObjective\nTo examine the usability and usefulness of wearable activity trackers for older adults living with chronic illness.\n\n\nMethods\nWe recruited a purposive sample of 32 participants over the age of 50, who had been previously diagnosed with a chronic illness, including vascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, and osteoporosis.\n\n Participants were between 52 and 84 years of age (mean 64); among the study participants, 23 (72%) were women and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m2.\n\n Participants tested 5 trackers, including a simple pedometer (Sportline or Mio) followed by 4 wearable activity trackers (Fitbit Zip, Misfit Shine, Jawbone Up 24, and Withings Pulse) in random order.\n\n Selected devices represented the range of wearable products and features available on the Canadian market in 2014. Participants wore each device for at least 3 days and evaluated it using a questionnaire developed from the Technology Acceptance Model.\n\n We used focus groups to explore participant experiences and a thematic analysis approach to data collection and analysis.\n\n\nResults\nOur study resulted in 4 themes: (1) adoption within a comfort zone; (2) self-awareness and goal setting; (3) purposes of data tracking; and (4) future of wearable activity trackers as health care devices.\n\n Prior to enrolling, few participants were aware of wearable activity trackers.\n\n Most also had been asked by a physician to exercise more and cited this as a motivation for testing the devices.\n\n None of the participants planned to purchase the simple pedometer after the study, citing poor accuracy and data loss, whereas 73% (N=32) planned to purchase a wearable activity tracker.\n\n Preferences varied but 50% felt they would buy a Fitbit and 42% felt they would buy a Misfit, Jawbone, or Withings.\n\n The simple pedometer had a mean acceptance score of 56/95 compared with 63 for the Withings, 65 for the Misfit and Jawbone, and 68 for the Fitbit.\n\n To improve usability, older users may benefit from devices that have better compatibility with personal computers or less-expensive Android mobile phones and tablets, and have comprehensive paper-based user manuals and apps that interpret user data.\n\n\nConclusions\nFor older adults living with chronic illness, wearable activity trackers are perceived as useful and acceptable.\n\n New users may need support to both set up the device and learn how to interpret their data.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4749845","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elizabeth","surname":"Lyons","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elizabeth","surname":"Lyons","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carmen","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lex","surname":"van

Specificity Analysis of Five Physical Activity Monitors","abstract":"Introduction\nPhysical activity is an essential aspect of a healthy lifestyle for both physical and mental health states.\n\n As step count is one of the most utilized measures for quantifying physical activity it is important that activity-monitoring devices be both sensitive and specific in recording actual steps taken and disregard non-stepping body movements.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the specificity of five activity monitors during a variety of prescribed non-stepping activities.\n\n\nMethods\nParticipants wore five activity monitors simultaneously for a variety of prescribed activities including deskwork, taking an elevator, taking a bus journey, automobile driving, washing and drying dishes; functional reaching task; indoor cycling; outdoor cycling; and indoor rowing.\n\n Each task was carried out for either a specific duration of time or over a specific distance.\n\n Activity monitors tested were the ActivPAL micro™, NL-2000™ pedometer, Withings Smart Activity Monitor Tracker (Pulse O2)™, Fitbit One™ and Jawbone UP™.\n\n Participants were video-recorded while carrying out the prescribed activities and the false positive step count registered on each activity monitor was obtained and compared to the video.\n\n\nResults\nAll activity monitors registered a significant number of false positive steps per minute during one or more of the prescribed activities.\n\n The Withings™ activity performed best, registering a significant number of false positive steps per minute during the outdoor cycling activity only (P = 0.025).\n\n The Jawbone™ registered a significant number of false positive steps during the functional reaching task and while washing and drying dishes, which involved arm and hand movement (P &lt; 0.01 for both).\n\n The ActivPAL™ registered a significant number of false positive steps during the cycling exercises (P &lt; 0.001 for both).\n\n\nConclusion\nAs a number of false positive steps were registered on the activity monitors during the non-stepping activities, the authors conclude that non-stepping physical activities can result in the false detection of steps.\n\n This can negatively affect the quantification of physical activity with regard to step count as an output.\n\n The Withings™ activity monitor performed best with regard to specificity during the activities of daily living tested.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5234787","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sandra","surname":"O’Connell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gearóid","surname":"ÓLaighin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Leo

accuracy is important, especially for their use in health care.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to use a wrist-worn optical heart rate (OHR) device to estimate heart rate (HR), energy expenditure (EE), and maximal oxygen intake capacity (VO2Max) during running and to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated parameters (HR, EE, and VO2Max) against golden reference methods.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 24 healthy volunteers, of whom 11 were female, with a mean age of 36.2 years (SD 8.2 years) participated in a submaximal self-paced outdoor running test and maximal voluntary exercise test in a sports laboratory.\n\n OHR was monitored with a PulseOn wrist-worn photoplethysmographic device and the running speed with a phone GPS sensor.\n\n A physiological model based on HR, running speed, and personal characteristics (age, gender, weight, and height) was used to estimate EE during the maximal voluntary exercise test and VO2Max during the submaximal outdoor running test.\n\n ECG-based HR and respiratory gas analysis based estimates were used as golden references.\n\n\nResults\nOHR was able to measure HR during running with a 1.9% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).\n\n VO2Max estimated during the submaximal outdoor running test was closely similar to the sports laboratory estimate (MAPE 5.2%).\n\n The energy expenditure estimate (n=23) was quite accurate when HR was above the aerobic threshold (MAPE 6.7%), but MAPE increased to 16.5% during a lighter intensity of exercise.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results suggest that wrist-worn OHR may accurately estimate HR during running up to maximal HR.\n\n When combined with physiological modeling, wrist-worn OHR may be used for an estimation of EE, especially during higher intensity running,

population, 600 000), Canada.\n\n Some neutral and standardized information on Pap test and HPV was provided before soliciting opinions.\n\n\nResults\n471 adults (18–69 year-olds) answered the questionnaire, the mean age was 45 years, 67% were female, and 65% had college or university degree.\n\n Eighty-six percent of women had undergone at least one Pap-test in their life, 55% in the last year, and 15% from 1 to 3 years ago.\n\n Among screened women, the test had been performed in the last three years in 100% of 18–30 year-olds, but only in 67% of 60–69 year-olds (P &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Only 15% of respondents had heard of HPV.\n\n Eighty-seven percent agreed that HPV vaccines could prevent cervical cancer, 73% that the vaccine has to be administered before the onset of sexual activity, 89% would recommend vaccination to their daughters and nieces.\n\n Among respondents &lt; 25 years, 91% would agree to receive the vaccine if it is publicly funded, but only 72% would agree to pay $100/dose.\n\n\nConclusion\nThere is an important heterogeneity in cervical cancer screening frequency and coverage.\n\n Despite low awareness of HPV infection, the majority of respondents would recommend or are ready to receive the HPV vaccine, but the cost could prevent its acceptability.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2206027","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chantal","surname":"Sauvageau","email":"chantal_sauvageau@ssss.gouv.qc.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bernard","surname":"Duval","email":"bernard.duval@ssss.gouv.qc.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vladimir","surname":"Gilca","email":"vladimir.gilca@ssss.gouv.qc.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"France","surname":"Lavoie","email":"france_lavoie@ssss.gouv.qc.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Manale","surname":"Ouakki","email":"manale.ouakki@ssss.gouv.qc.ca","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ypmed.2004.01.003","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Beliefs

self-reported body weight, height and waist circumference in a Dutch overweight working population","abstract":"Background\nIn population studies, body mass index (BMI) is generally calculated from self-reported body weight and height.\n\n The self-report of these anthropometrics is known to be biased, resulting in a misclassification of BMI status.\n\n The aim of our study is to evaluate the accuracy of self-reported weight, height and waist circumference among a Dutch overweight (Body Mass Index [BMI] ? 25 kg/m2) working population, and to determine to what extent the accuracy was moderated by sex, age, BMI, socio-economic status (SES) and health-related factors.\n\n\nMethods\nBoth measured and self-reported body weight and body height were collected in 1298 healthy overweight employees (66.6% male; mean age 43.9 ± 8.6 years; mean BMI 29.5 ± 3.4 kg/m2), taking part in the ALIFE@Work project.\n\n Measured and self-reported waist circumferences (WC) were available for a sub-group of 250 overweight subjects (70.4% male; mean age 44.1 ± 9.2 years; mean BMI 29.6 ± 3.0 kg/m2).\n\n Intra Class Correlation (ICC), Cohen's kappa and Bland Altman plots were used for reliability analyses, while linear regression analyses were performed to assess the factors that were (independently) associated with the reliability.\n\n\nResults\nBody weight was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) under-reported on average by 1.4 kg and height significantly (p &lt; 0.001) over-reported by 0.7 cm.\n\n Consequently, BMI was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) under-reported by 0.7 kg/m2.\n\n WC was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) over-reported by 1.1 cm.\n\n Although the self-reporting of anthropometrics was biased, ICC's showed high concordance between measured and self-reported values.\n\n Also, substantial agreement existed between the prevalences of BMI status and increased WC based on measured and self-reported data.\n\n The under-reporting of BMI and body weight was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) affected by measured weight, height, SES and smoking status, and the over-reporting of WC by age, sex and measured WC.\n\n\nConclusion\nResults suggest that self-reported BMI and WC are satisfactorily accurate for the assessment of the prevalence of overweight/obesity and increased WC in a middle-aged overweight working population.\n\n As the accuracy of self-reported anthropometrics is affected by measured weight, height, WC, smoking status and/or SES, results for these subgroups should be interpreted with caution.\n\n Due to the large power of our study, the clinical significance of our statistical significant findings may be limited.\n\n\nTrial

and obesity in population-based surveys","abstract":"Background\nThe basis for this study is the fact that instrument error increases the variance of the distribution of body mass index (BMI).\n\n Combined with a defined cut-off value this may impact upon the estimated proportion of overweight and obesity.\n\n It is important to ensure high quality surveillance data in order to follow trends of estimated prevalence of overweight and obesity.\n\n The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of instrument error, due to uncalibrated scales and stadiometers, on prevalence estimates of overweight and obesity.\n\n\nMethods\nAnthropometric measurements from a nationally representative sample were used; the Norwegian Child Growth study (NCG) of 3474 children.\n\n Each of the 127 participating schools received a reference weight and a reference length to determine the correction value.\n\n Correction value corresponds to instrument error and is the difference between the true value and the measured, uncorrected weight and height at local scales and stadiometers.\n\n Simulations were used to determine the expected implications of instrument errors.\n\n To systematically investigate this, the coefficient of variation (CV) of instrument error was used in the simulations and was increased successively.\n\n\nResults\nSimulations showed that the estimated prevalence of overweight and obesity increased systematically with the size of instrument error when the mean instrument error was zero.\n\n The estimated prevalence was 16.4% with no instrument error and was, on average, overestimated by 0.5 percentage points based on observed variance of instrument error from the NCG-study.\n\n Further, the estimated prevalence was 16.7% with 1% CV of instrument error, and increased to 17.8%, 19.5% and 21.6% with 2%, 3% and 4% CV of instrument error, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nFailure to calibrate measuring instruments is likely to lead to overestimation of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in population-based surveys.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3606378","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Biehl","email":"anbi@fhi.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ragnhild","surname":"Hovengen","email":"ragnhild.hovengen@fhi.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haakon

random-effects meta-analysis and the estimation of between-study correlation","abstract":"Background\nWhen multiple endpoints are of interest in evidence synthesis, a multivariate meta-analysis can jointly synthesise those endpoints and utilise their correlation.\n\n A multivariate random-effects meta-analysis must incorporate and estimate the between-study correlation (?B).\n\n\nMethods\nIn this paper we assess maximum likelihood estimation of a general normal model and a generalised model for bivariate random-effects meta-analysis (BRMA).\n\n We consider two applied examples, one involving a diagnostic marker and the other a surrogate outcome.\n\n These motivate a simulation study where estimation properties from BRMA are compared with those from two separate univariate random-effects meta-analyses (URMAs), the traditional approach.\n\n\nResults\nThe normal BRMA model estimates ?B as -1 in both applied examples.\n\n Analytically we show this is due to the maximum likelihood estimator sensibly truncating the between-study covariance matrix on the boundary of its parameter space.\n\n Our simulations reveal this commonly occurs when the number of studies is small or the within-study variation is relatively large; it also causes upwardly biased between-study variance estimates, which are inflated to compensate for the restriction on ?^\n

Importantly, this does not induce any systematic bias in the pooled estimates and produces conservative standard errors and mean-square errors.\n\n Furthermore, the normal BRMA is preferable to two normal URMAs; the mean-square error and standard error of pooled estimates is generally smaller in the BRMA, especially given data missing at random.\n\n For meta-analysis of proportions we then show that a generalised BRMA model is better still.\n\n This correctly uses a binomial rather than normal distribution, and produces better estimates than the normal BRMA and also two generalised URMAs; however the model may sometimes not converge due to difficulties estimating ?B.\n\n\nConclusion\nA BRMA model offers numerous advantages over separate univariate synthesises; this paper highlights some of these benefits in both a normal and generalised modelling framework, and examines the estimation of between-study correlation to aid practitioners.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1800862","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Richard

retirement","abstract":"Background\nRetirement is a life transition involving an obligatory change in how people use their time.\n\n Because there are strong associations between use of time and health, different changes in time use following retirement may have different impacts on mental health.\n\n\nMethods\n105 participants were followed from 6 months before retirement to 12 months after retirement.\n\n At each time-point, use of time was quantified using a validated computerised 24-hour recall.\n\n Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS21), well-being with the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS), life satisfaction with the Australian Unity Personal Well-being Index (AUPWI), and self-esteem with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale.\n\n Time-use data were analysed using compositional data analysis, which treats the 24-h day as a holistic “activity composition” rather than as individual activity domains.\n\n Time flow analytics were used to map patterns of change in time use from pre-retirement to post-retirement.\n\n Regression analysis was used to determine whether changes in the activity composition were significantly associated with changes in mental health.\n\n Compositional isotemporal substitution models were used to illustrate dose-response relationships between changes in time use and conditional changes in mental health for individual activity domains, such as sleep, screen time and physical activity.\n\n\nResults\nFollowing retirement, time no longer spent in work flowed mainly to household chores, sleep, screen time and quiet time (e.\n\ng.\n\n reading).\n\n Mental health improved overall.\n\n Changes in the activity composition were significantly related to conditional changes in DASS21 total score, depression, stress, and self-esteem, but not to anxiety, well-being or life satisfaction.\n\n Replacing work time with physical activity or sleep was associated with positive changes in mental health.\n\n Effect sizes for 60-minute substitutions ranged from –0.15 to +0.31.\nConclusion\nFollowing retirement, replacing work with physical activity, and to a lesser extent sleep, is associated with better mental health.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6023158","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tim","surname":"Olds","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicola

PTSD symptoms were measured by six items from the Impact of Events Scale-revised.\n\n Relationships among Ebola experience, perceived Ebola threat and mental health symptoms were examined through binary logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nPrevalence of any anxiety-depression symptom was 48% (95% CI 46.8% to 50.0%), and of any PTSD symptom 76% (95% CI 75.0% to 77.8%).\n\n In addition, 6% (95% CI 5.4% to 7.0%) met the clinical cut-off for anxiety-depression, 27% (95% CI 25.8% to 28.8%) met levels of clinical concern for PTSD and 16% (95% CI 14.7% to 17.1%) met levels of probable PTSD diagnosis.\n\n Factors associated with higher reporting of any symptoms in bivariate analysis included region of residence, experiences with Ebola and perceived Ebola threat.\n\n Knowing someone quarantined for Ebola was independently associated with anxiety-depression (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.3, 95%?CI 1.7 to 2.9) and PTSD (AOR 2.095% CI 1.5 to 2.8) symptoms.\n\n Perceiving Ebola as a threat was independently associated with anxiety-depression (AOR 1.69 95% CI 1.44 to 1.98) and PTSD (AOR 1.86 95% CI 1.56 to 2.21) symptoms.\n\n\nConclusion\nSymptoms of PTSD and anxiety-depression were common after one year of Ebola response; psychosocial support may be needed for people with Ebola-related experiences.\n\n Preventing, detecting, and responding to mental health conditions should be an important component of global health security efforts.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5873549","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mohamed

Systematic Review of Individual, Aggregate, and Contextual Associations","abstract":"Background\nThe U.\n\nS.\n\n foreclosure crisis intensified markedly during the Great Recession of 2007-09, and currently an estimated five percent of U.\n\nS.\n\n residential properties are more than 90 days past due or in the process of foreclosure.\n\n Yet there has been no systematic assessment of the effects of foreclosure on health and mental health.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nI applied systematic search terms to PubMed and PsycINFO to identify quantitative or qualitative studies about the relationship between home foreclosure and health or mental health.\n\n After screening the titles and abstracts of 930 publications and reviewing the full text of 76 articles, dissertations, and other reports, I identified 42 publications representing 35 unique studies about foreclosure, health, and mental health.\n\n The majority of studies (32 [91%]) concluded that foreclosure had adverse effects on health or mental health, while three studies yielded null or mixed findings.\n\n Only two studies examined the extent to which foreclosure may have disproportionate impacts on ethnic or racial minority populations.\n\n\nConclusions\nHome foreclosure adversely affects health and mental health through channels operating at multiple levels: at the individual level, the stress of personally experiencing foreclosure was associated with worsened mental health and adverse health behaviors, which were in turn linked to poorer health status; at the community level, increasing degradation of the neighborhood environment had indirect, cross-level adverse effects on health and mental health.\n\n Early intervention may be able to prevent acute economic shocks from eventually developing into the chronic stress of foreclosure, with all of the attendant benefits this implies for health and mental health status.\n\n Programs designed to encourage early return of foreclosed properties back into productive use may have similar health and mental health benefits.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4388711","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander

China.\n\n Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine the structural relationship between measured variables.\n\n This observational study aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and February 2020 in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nMaterial/Methods\nA one-month cross-sectional observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection.\n\n Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS), respectively.\n\n Pearson’s correlation analysis and SEM identified the interactions between these factors.\n\n\nResults\nLevels of social support for medical staff were significantly associated with self-efficacy and sleep quality and negatively associated with the degree of anxiety and stress.\n\n Levels of anxiety were significantly associated with the levels of stress, which negatively impacted self-efficacy and sleep quality.\n\n Anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy were mediating variables associated with social support and sleep quality.\n\n\nConclusions\nSEM showed that medical staff in China who were treating patients with COVID-19 infection during January and February 2020 had levels of anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy

the construct of well-being, make it difficult to reach conclusions about the relationship between the two phenomena.\n This systematic review synthesizes the results produced into this topic over the last three decades.\n A total of 112 studies were included, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines.\n On the one hand, these works revealed the terminological heterogeneity in research on well-being and the way the absence of symptoms of illness are commonly used to measure it, while on the other hand, they also showed that romantic relationships can be an important source of well-being for both adolescents and emerging adults.\n The findings underline the importance of providing a better definition of well-being, as well as to attribute greater value to the significance of romantic relationships.\n Devoting greater empirical, educational, and community efforts to romantic development in the stages leading up to

health, particularly during the acute phase.\n This gap in knowledge means we are critically ill-equipped to support communities as they face the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.\n This study aimed to provide data urgently needed to inform government policy and resource allocation now and in other future crises.\n The study was the first to survey a representative sample from the Australian population at the early acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Depression, anxiety, and psychological wellbeing were measured with well-validated scales (PHQ-9, GAD-7, WHO-5).\n Using linear regression, we tested for associations between mental health and exposure to COVID-19, impacts of COVID-19 on work and social functioning, and socio-demographic factors.\n Depression and anxiety symptoms were substantively elevated relative to usual population data, including for individuals with no existing mental health diagnosis.\n Exposure to COVID-19 had minimal association with mental health outcomes.\n Recent exposure to the Australian bushfires was also unrelated to depression and anxiety, although bushfire smoke exposure correlated with reduced psychological wellbeing.\n In contrast, pandemic-induced impairments in work and social functioning were strongly associated with elevated depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as decreased psychological wellbeing.\n Financial distress due to the pandemic, rather than job loss per se, was also a key correlate of poorer mental health.\n These findings suggest that minimizing disruption to work and social functioning, and increasing access to mental health services in the community, are important policy goals to minimize pandemic-related impacts on mental health and wellbeing.\n Innovative and creative strategies are needed to meet these community needs while continuing to enact vital public health strategies to control the spread of

Comparing GHQ-12 scores within individuals, adjusting for time trends and significant predictors of change, increases were greatest in 18–24-year-olds (2·69 points, 95% CI 1·89–3·48), 25–34-year-olds (1·57, 0·96–2·18), women (0·92, 0·50–1·35), and people living with young children (1·45, 0·79–2·12).\n\n People employed before the pandemic also averaged a notable increase in GHQ-12 score (0·63, 95% CI 0·20–1·06).\n\n\nInterpretation\nBy late April, 2020, mental health in the UK had deteriorated compared with pre-COVID-19 trends.\n\n Policies emphasising the needs of women, young people, and those with preschool aged children are likely to play an important part in preventing future mental illness.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7373389","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthias","surname":"Pierce","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Holly","surname":"Hope","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tamsin","surname":"Ford","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Stephani","surname":"Hatch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Hotopf","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ann","surname":"John","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Evangelos","surname":"Kontopantelis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roger","surname":"Webb","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Wessely","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sally","surname":"McManus","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kathryn M","surname":"Abel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Multidisciplinary research priorities for the COVID-19 pandemic: a call for action for mental health science","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Mental health and psychosocial considerations during COVID-19 outbreak","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Says who?

Nutrition-related changes and their sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-status correlates were investigated using multivariable logistic regression models.\n\n Clusters of participants were defined using an ascending hierarchical classification of change profiles derived from multiple correspondence analyses.\n\n\nResults\nDuring the lockdown, trends of unfavorable changes were observed: decreased physical activity (reported by 53% of the participants), increased sedentary time (reported by 63%), increased snacking, decreased consumption of fresh food (especially fruit and fish), and increased consumption of sweets, cookies, and cakes.\n\n Yet, the opposite trends were also observed: increased home cooking (reported by 40%) and increased physical activity (reported by 19%).\n\n Additionally, 35% of the participants gained weight (mean weight gain in these individuals, 1.8 kg ± SD 1.3 kg) and 23% lost weight (2 kg ± SD 1.4 kg weight loss).\n\n All of these trends displayed associations with various individual characteristics.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results suggest that nutrition-related changes occurred during the lockdown in both unfavorable and favorable directions.\n\n The observed unfavorable changes should be considered in the event of a future lockdown, and should also be monitored to prevent an increase in the nutrition-related burden of disease, should these diet/physical activity changes be maintained in the long run.\n\n Understanding the favorable changes may help extend them on a broader scale.\n\n This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.\n\ngov as NCT03335644.\n","id":"PMC7989637","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mélanie","surname":"Deschasaux-Tanguy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Druesne-Pecollo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Younes","surname":"Esseddik","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fabien Szabo","surname":"de Edelenyi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benjamin","surname":"Allès","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Valentina A","surname":"Andreeva","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julia","surname":"Baudry","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hélène","surname":"Charreire","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Valérie","surname":"Deschamps","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Manon","surname":"Egnell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Leopold K","surname":"Fezeu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pilar","surname":"Galan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chantal","surname":"Julia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emmanuelle","surname":"Kesse-Guyot","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paule","surname":"Latino-Martel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Michel","surname":"Oppert","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sandrine","surname":"Péneau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charlotte","surname":"Verdot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Serge","surname":"Hercberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mathilde","surname":"Touvier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WHO.

adults, whereas their identification could be useful for defining effective public health measures.\n\n The aim of our study was to assess the associations of these factors with daily snacking behavior and its dietary quality.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>This cross-sectional study included 84,692 women and 23,491 men from the NutriNet-Santé cohort study.\n\n Occurrence of snacking, energy intake from snacks, snack nutrient, and energy densities were assessed using 24-h dietary records of weekdays at baseline.\n\n Associations between socio-economic and demographic factors (age, presence of children in the household, education, income, occupation), and snacking behavior were examined using multivariable logistic regression and analysis of covariance, stratified by sex and adjusted for total daily energy intake.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Older individuals were more likely to snack during the day in both sexes while individuals with primary education (OR?=?0.79 (0.71;0.87) in women; OR?=?0.71 (0.60;0.83) in men), female employees (OR?=?0.94 (0.89;0.99), and self-employed women were less likely to snack during the day.\n\n Older individuals, in particular middle-aged subjects, had higher snack nutrient density, and lower energy intake and density from snacks compared with younger adults.\n\n Presence of a child in the household was associated with higher energy density, lower nutrient density (in women), and lower energy intake from snacks (in men), compared with those who lived without a child in household.\n\n In low income individuals and manual workers, snacks had lower nutrient density and higher energy content than in higher socioeconomic categories.\n\n At last, energy intake from daily snacking occasions was higher in women with low education level.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Although snacking was less prevalent in low socioeconomic categories and young adults, their snacks had higher energy content and were of poorer nutrient density.\n\n Such findings provide useful information on mechanisms of social disparities in dietary behavior.\n\n\nTrial registration\nid='Par5'>This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (IRB Inserm No0000388FWA00005831)

risk factors: an overview of systematic reviews","abstract":"Background\nNon-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the largest cause of premature death worldwide.\n\n Socioeconomic inequalities contribute to a disparity in the burden of NCDs among disadvantaged and advantaged populations in low (LIC), middle (MIC), and high income countries (HIC).\n\n We conducted an overview of systematic reviews to systematically and objectively assess the available evidence on socioeconomic inequalities in relation to morbidity and mortality of NCDs and their risk factors.\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched PubMed, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Global Health, and Business Source Complete for relevant systematic reviews published between 2003 and December 2013. Two authors independently screened abstracts and full-text publications and determined the risk of bias of the included systematic reviews.\n\n\nResults\nWe screened 3302 abstracts, 173 full-text publications and ultimately included 22 systematic reviews.\n\n Most reviews had major methodological shortcomings; however, our synthesis showed that having low socioeconomic status (SES) and/or living in low and middle income countries (LMIC) increased the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD), lung and gastric cancer, type 2 diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n Furthermore, low SES increased the risk of mortality from lung cancer, COPD, and reduced breast cancer survival in HIC.\n\n Reviews included here indicated that lower SES is a risk factor for obesity in HIC, but this association varied by SES measure.\n\n Early case fatalities of stroke were lower and survival of retinoblastoma was higher in MIC compared to LIC.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe current evidence supports an association between socioeconomic inequalities and NCDs and risk factors for NCDs.\n\n However, this evidence is incomplete and limited by the fairly low methodological quality of the systematic reviews, including shortcomings in the study selection and quality assessment process.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

live in home-confinement to prevent the expansion of the disease.\n Spain was one of the countries with the strictest conditions, as outdoor physical activity was banned for nearly two months.\n This study aimed to analyse the changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviours in Spanish university students before and during the confinement by COVID-19 with special focus on gender.\n We also analysed enjoyment, the tools used and motivation and impediments for doing physical activity.\n An online questionnaire, which included the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form and certain “ad hoc” questions, was designed.\n Students were recruited by distributing an invitation through the administrative channels of 16 universities and a total of 13,754 valid surveys were collected.\n Overall, university students reduced moderate (?29.5%) and vigorous (?18.3%) physical activity during the confinement and increased sedentary time (+52.7%).\n However, they spent more time on high intensity interval training (HIIT) (+18.2%) and mind-body activities (e.\ng.\n, yoga) (+80.0%).\n Adaptation to the confinement, in terms of physical activity, was handled better by women than by men.\n These results will help design strategies for each gender to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour during confinement

everywhere.\n\n Therefore, walking is a feasible behavior on which to tailor public health messages.\n\n This study assesses the prospective association and dose?response relationship between daily steps and all?cause mortality.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nDaily steps were measured by waist?mounted accelerometers in 2183 individuals (53% women) for seven consecutive days at baseline (2008?09).\n\n Participants were followed for a median period of 9.1 years and associations between steps and all?cause mortality determined by registry linkage were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression with adjustment for relevant covariates.\n\n\nResults\nMean age was 57.0 (SD 10.9) years at baseline.\n\n Median (IQR) daily steps across ascending quartiles were 4651 (3495?5325), 6862 (6388?7350), 8670 (8215?9186), and 11 467 (10 556?13 110), respectively.\n\n During follow?up, 119 individuals died (68% men).\n\n Higher number of daily steps was associated with a lower risk of

cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences;

Italy to contain the epidemic of the novel Coronavirus.\n People were forced to restrict their movement and social contacts, therefore having a higher risk of inactivity.\n This study, carried out among Italian undergraduates, explored their sedentary and physical activities (PA) during the lockdown with respect to their previous habits.\n Methods: An electronic questionnaire was administered once to students attending three Italian universities after the end of lockdown.\n Results: A total of 1430 students (mean age 22.9 ± 3.5 years, 65.5% females) completed the questionnaire.\n All the sedentary behaviors increased significantly, and all the physical activities decreased significantly during the lockdown.\n Time spent using electronic devices showed the highest increase (+52.4 min/day), and walking the greatest decrease (?365.5 min/week).\n Being younger than 22 years old, female, and previously active, attending the universities of Naples and Rome and having at least one graduate parent were associated with the achievement of recommended levels of PA even during the lockdown.\n Conclusions: This study highlights the reduction of PA among Italian undergraduates in the course of home-confinement due to the CoViD-19 pandemic.\n The practice of adequate PA during the lockdown was mainly associated with the previous adoption of an active lifestyle.\n Promoting active

of Home Quarantine on Physical Activity Among Older Adults Living at Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Interview Study","abstract":"Background\nOlder adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at risk of death from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2).\n\n In this period of quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity.\n\n This issue is important, as the impact of a sedentary lifestyle might be lower for children and young adults, but is far more severe for older adults.\n\n Although older adults need to stay at home because they have a higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), they need to avoid a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n Physical activity is important for older adults, especially to maintain their level of independence, mental health, and well-being.\n\n Maintaining mobility in old age is necessary, as it may predict loss of independence in older adults.\n\n\nObjective\nOur first objective was to evaluate the impact of this quarantine period on physical activity programs and on the physical and mental health of older adults.\n\n Our second objective was to discuss alternatives to physical activity programs that could be suggested for this population to avoid a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a qualitative survey using semistructured interviews with professionals (managers in charge of physical activity programs for older adults and sports trainers who run these physical activity programs) from the French Federation of Physical Education and Voluntary Gymnastics (FFPEVG) and older adults participating in a physical activity program of the FFPEVG.\n\n We followed a common interview guide.\n\n For analysis, we carried out a thematic analysis of the interviews.\n\n\nResults\nThis study suggests that the COVID-19 epidemic has affected, before quarantine measures, the number of seniors attending group physical activity programs in the two study territories.\n\n In addition, despite the decline in their participation in group physical activities before the quarantine, older adults expressed the need to perform physical activity at home.\n\n There is a need to help older adults integrate simple and safe ways to stay physically active in a limited space.\n\n A national policy to support older adults for physical activity at home appears essential in this context.\n\n\nConclusions\nGiven the results of our study, it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain physical activity at home.\n\n We are concerned about the level of independence and mental health state of older adults after the end of quarantine if there is no appropriate campaign to promote physical activity among them at home.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7207013","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carmen","surname":"Miranda","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Carmen","surname":"Miranda","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Stein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luc","surname":"Goethals","email":"luc.goethals@univ-st-etienne.fr","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Luc","surname":"Goethals","email":"luc.goethals@univ-st-etienne.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Barth","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Barth","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica","surname":"Guyot","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jessica","surname":"Guyot","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Hupin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Hupin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Celarier","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Celarier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bienvenu","surname":"Bongue","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Bienvenu","surname":"Bongue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.pcad.2020.03.009","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Physical

that purpose, an online questionnaire, based on 44 items including socio-demographic data, Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) Adherence Screener (MEDAS) as a reference of a healthy diet, processed foods intake, changes in their usual food choices and weight gain was distributed using social media and snowball sampling.\n A total of 7514 participants (37% aged below 35 years, 70.6% female, 77.9% university-level education or higher) from all the Spanish territory completed the questionnaire.\n Results outlined healthier dietary behaviours during the confinement when compared to previous habits.\n Overall, the MEDAS score (ranging from 0 to 14, whereby higher a scoring reflects greater adherence to the MedDiet) increased significantly from 6.53 ± 2 to 7.34 ± 1.93 during the confinement.\n Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender, region and other variables, showed a statistically significant higher likelihood of changing the adherence to the MedDiet (towards an increase in adherence) in those persons who decreased the intake of fried foods, snacks, fast foods, red meat, pastries or sweet beverages, but increased MedDiet-related foods such as olive oil, vegetables, fruits or legumes during the confinement.\n COVID-19 confinement in Spain has led to the adoption of healthier dietary habits/behaviours in the studied population, as reflected by a higher adherence to the MedDiet.\n This improvement, if sustained in the long-term, could have a positive impact on the prevention of chronic diseases and COVID-19-related

associated with lower obesity risk.\n\n It is unclear whether a brief dietary assessment tool, instead of full-length comprehensive methods, can also capture this association.\n\n In addition to reduced costs, a brief tool has the interesting advantage of allowing immediate feedback to participants in interventional studies.\n\n Another relevant question is which individual items of such a brief tool are responsible for this association.\n\n We examined these associations using a 14-item tool of adherence to the Mediterranean diet as exposure and body mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) as outcomes.\n\n\nDesign\nCross-sectional assessment of all participants in the “PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea” (PREDIMED) trial.\n\n\nSubjects\n7,447 participants (55–80 years, 57% women) free of cardiovascular disease, but with either type 2 diabetes or ?3 cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n Trained dietitians used both a validated 14-item questionnaire and a full-length validated 137-item food frequency questionnaire to assess dietary habits.\n\n Trained nurses measured weight, height and waist circumference.\n\n\nResults\nStrong inverse linear associations between the 14-item tool and all adiposity indexes were found.\n\n For a two-point increment in the 14-item score, the multivariable-adjusted differences in WHtR were ?0.0066 (95%

the Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and Its Relationship with Individual Lifestyle: The Role of Healthy Behaviors, Pro-Environmental Behaviors, Income, and Education","abstract":"The reduction of diet-related diseases and the improvement of environmental sustainability represent two of the major 21st century food policy challenges.\n Sustainable diets could significantly contribute to achieving both of these goals, improving consumer health and reducing the environmental impact of food production and consumption.\n The Mediterranean diet (MD) represents an excellent example of sustainable diet, however recent evidence indicates that such a dietary pattern is now progressively disappearing in Mediterranean countries.\n In such a context, this paper explores how individual lifestyle and habits are related to a high/low adherence to the MD model.\n The goal is to examine whether there is a relationship between individuals’ healthy and pro-environmental behaviors and their level of adherence to the MD.\n The analysis also explores the role of consumer income and education.\n The study is based on the Italian population (n = 42,000) and uses a structural equation model approach.\n The results outline that the MD is part of a sustainability-oriented lifestyle and stress the key role of both income and education in affecting adherence to MD.\n Future policy aimed at contrasting the gradual disappearance of the MD should emphasize the sustainable dimension of the MD, meanwhile reducing socio-economic disparities among different population segments.\n","id":"PMC5852717","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alessia","surname":"Cavaliere","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elisa","surname":"De

food consumed OH and the contribution to diet.\n This study assessed intake of foods and drinks consumed OH and at home (AH), as well as their nutritional contribution to the daily diet of university students in Tirana, Albania.\n Using a single day Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) 24-hour dietary recall, we examined food intake among 289 students aged 18–24 years old, from three major universities in Albania.\n Contribution of eating OH to total energy intake per day, as well as to daily consumption of macronutrients by eating OH intensity tertiles were assessed.\n Foods and drinks consumed OH contributed 46.9% [95%CI:41.4–52.8] of total daily energy intake, representing, on average, 1169.1kcal [95%CI:1088.3–1249.9].\n Sweets, soft drinks and meat products were more frequently consumed OH, while fruits and vegetables consumption was extremely low.\n The average quantity of sugars and dietary fats per day was higher AH, 76.9g [95%CI:70.3–83.5] and 173.7g [95%CI:163.2–184.2] respectively, compared to OH, 33.7g [95%CI:30.4–37.0] and 142.0g [95%CI:131.5–152.5] respectively.\n Dietary composition of AH intake was richer in sugars, total fats and proteins, while OH intake was richer in saturated fats.\n The overall diet appeared unhealthy, when nutrients were assessed as energy percentage against WHO proposed nutrient standards for sugar and saturated fats.\n Eating OH, even though was associated with lower fruits and vegetables intake, was not clearly associated with poor diet quality, as AH foods were also characterized by increased saturated fats and sugars intake as energy percentage.\n This study provides data on the first assessment of current dietary patterns of the studied population and can be used as baseline for designing and conducting future studies and interventions targeting malnutrition in all its forms.\n","id":"PMC6175278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Erand","surname":"Llanaj","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Róza","surname":"Ádány","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Róza","surname":"Ádány","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carl","surname":"Lachat","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marijke","surname":"D’Haese","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jacobus

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt;

be considered a real pathology.\n In the world wide, obesity represent one of the major public health issue associated with increased morbidity and mortality.\n Overweight or obesity, in fact, significantly increases the risk of contracting diseases, such as: arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, cerebral vasculopathy, gallbladder lithiasis, arthropathy, ovarian polycytosis, sleep apnea syndrome, and some neoplasms.\n Despite numerous informative campaigns, unfortunately, the fight against obesity does not seem to work: in the last years, the prevalence continued to increase.\n The progressive and rapid increase in the incidence of obesity, which has characterized most of the economically advanced countries in the last decade, has been the main stimulus for the research of the mechanisms underlying this pathology and the related disorders.\n The aims of this review is to provide a revision of the literature in order to define obesity as diseases, secondly to highlight the limits and the inaccuracy of common tools used for the diagnosis of obesity, and as a third thing to strengthen the concept of the complexity of obesity as a disease among political health care providers.\n Obesity may be viewed as a multifactorial pathology and chronic low-grade inflammatory disease.\n In fact, people affected by obesity have greater risk of developing comorbility and morbility, respect to healthy.\n Hence, the absolute therapeutic benefit is directly proportional to the basic risk.\n So, internationally interest on early diagnosis of obesity is growing to avoid under- and overdiagnosis consequences.\n Therefore, the consequences are an aggravation of the disease and an increase in obesity related pathology like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.\n The most widely used parameter for diagnosis, body mass index (BMI) is not suitable for assessing the body fat.\n In fact, several studies demonstrate that BMI alone cannot define obesity, which consists not so much in weight gain as in excess fat mass.\n The use of suitable tools for the assessment of fat mass percentage combined with clinical and genetic analysis allowed to identify different phenotypes of obesity, which explain the various paradoxes of obesity.\n It is essential to adopt all possible strategies to be able to combat obesity, ameliorate the suffering of patients, and reduce the social and treatment costs of obesity.\n","id":"PMC6530037","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Antonino","surname":"De

14-Item Mediterranean Diet Assessment Tool and Obesity Indexes among High-Risk Subjects: The PREDIMED Trial","abstract":"Objective\nIndependently of total caloric intake, a better quality of the diet (for example, conformity to the Mediterranean diet) is associated with lower obesity risk.\n\n It is unclear whether a brief dietary assessment tool, instead of full-length comprehensive methods, can also capture this association.\n\n In addition to reduced costs, a brief tool has the interesting advantage of allowing immediate feedback to participants in interventional studies.\n\n Another relevant question is which individual items of such a brief tool are responsible for this association.\n\n We examined these associations using a 14-item tool of adherence to the Mediterranean diet as exposure and body mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) as outcomes.\n\n\nDesign\nCross-sectional assessment of all participants in the “PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea” (PREDIMED) trial.\n\n\nSubjects\n7,447 participants (55–80 years, 57% women) free of cardiovascular disease, but with either type 2 diabetes or ?3 cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n Trained dietitians used both a validated 14-item questionnaire and a full-length validated 137-item food frequency questionnaire to assess dietary habits.\n\n Trained nurses measured weight, height and waist circumference.\n\n\nResults\nStrong inverse linear associations between the 14-item tool and all adiposity indexes were found.\n\n For a two-point increment in the 14-item score, the multivariable-adjusted differences in WHtR were ?0.0066 (95% confidence interval, –0.0088 to ?0.0049) for women and –0.0059 (–0.0079 to –0.0038) for men.\n\n The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for a WHtR&gt;0.6 in participants scoring ?10 points versus ?7 points was 0.68 (0.57 to 0.80) for women and 0.66 (0.54 to 0.80) for men.\n\n High consumption of nuts and low consumption of sweetened/carbonated beverages presented the strongest inverse associations with abdominal obesity.\n\n\nConclusions\nA brief 14-item tool was able to capture a strong monotonic inverse association between adherence to a good quality dietary pattern (Mediterranean diet) and obesity indexes in a population of adults at high cardiovascular risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3419206","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Miguel

was to examine the simultaneous relationships between food insecurity and health-related outcomes including body mass index (BMI) and overall health in a college student population.\n Randomly sampled students in the University of California 10 campus system were invited to participate in an online survey in spring 2015. The analytic sample size was 8705 graduate and undergraduate students.\n Data were collected on FI in the past year, daily servings of fruits and vegetables (FV), number of days in the past week of enough sleep and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA), height and weight, self-rated health, and student characteristics.\n Using path analysis, mediated pathways between FI, BMI, and poor health were examined through FV intake, number of days of MVPA and enough sleep.\n Analyses controlled for student characteristics.\n Mean BMI was 23.6 kg/m2 (SD, 5.0), and average self-rated health was good.\n FI was directly and indirectly related to higher BMI and poor health through three pathways.\n First, FI was related to fewer days of enough sleep, which in turn was related to increased BMI and poor health.\n Second, FI was related to fewer days of MVPA, which in turn was related to increased BMI and poor health.\n Third, FI was related to fewer daily servings of FV, which in turn was related to poor health.\n FI is associated with poor health behaviors among college students, which may contribute to higher weight status and poor health.\n These findings highlight the importance of food security for a healthy college experience.\n ","id":"PMC6627945","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Suzanna

Effects of Low Physical Fitness on Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Adolescents: A Cross-Sectional Pooled Analysis","abstract":"To examine the combined association of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), muscular fitness (MF), and adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MeDiet) on cardiovascular risk in adolescents, a pooled study, including cross-sectional data from two projects [2477 adolescents (1320 girls) aged 12–18 years], was completed.\n A shuttle run test was used to assess CRF.\n MF was assessed by the standing-long jump and handgrip tests.\n Adherence to a MeDiet was assessed by the Kidmed questionnaire.\n A cardiovascular risk score was computed from the following components: Age and sex, waist circumference, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and glucose.\n Analysis of covariance showed that participants classified as having optimal (High) adherence to a MeDiet/HighMF/HighCRF, as well those classified as low adherence to a MeDiet/HighMF/HighCRF, had, on average, the lowest cardiovascular risk score (F = 15.6; p &lt; 0.001).\n In addition, the high adherence to a MeDiet/LowMF/LowCRF group had the highest odds of having a high cardiovascular risk (OR = 7.1; 95% CI: 3.4–15.1; p &lt; 0.001), followed by the low adherence to a MeDiet/LowMF/LowCRF group (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 2.2–6.3; p &lt; 0.001), high adherence to a MeDiet/HighMF/LowCRF group (OR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.4–7.0; p = 0.006), and low adherence to a MeDiet/LowMF/HighCRF group (OR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.5–4.4; p = 0.002) when compared to those with high adherence to a MeDiet/HighMF/HighCRF, after adjustments for potential confounders.\n In conclusion, our findings showed that, regardless of the MeDiet status, adolescents with low MF and low CRF cumulatively, presented the highest cardiovascular disease risk.\n Therefore, these findings suggest that the combination of these two fitness components may be beneficial to adolescents’ cardiometabolic profile, independent of MeDiet behaviour.\n","id":"PMC6073276","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"César","surname":"Agostinis-Sobrinho","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Rute","surname":"Santos","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Rute","surname":"Santos","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rafaela","surname":"Rosário","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carla","surname":"Moreira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luís","surname":"Lopes","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Luís","surname":"Lopes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jorge","surname":"Mota","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jorge","surname":"Mota","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Arvydas","surname":"Martinkenas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"García-Hermoso","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jorge

assessed.\n Adherence to the MDP was 43.1% (SD 5.8) in 1999–2000 and 44.6% (SD 8.3) in 2009–2010. Higher age was directly associated with higher adherence to the MDP, and this association was stronger in males than in females.\n Young generations and smokers showed the lowest adherence to MDP, whereas people with higher educational and socio-economic level, and who were physically active showed the highest adherence.\n According to the place of birth, the increase in the percentage of the adherence to the MDP was observed to be smaller among the Balearic Island’s natives than among people born abroad.\n In 2009–2010, individuals in the MDP’s fourth quartile were more likely to be older (aged 46–65 years), and were less likely to have a low occupational level, to have a light physical activity level and to be smoker than in 1999–2000. The adherence to the MDP has been stabilized and slightly recovered among the Balearic Islands’ adult population in the last decade.\n","id":"PMC5537863","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria del Mar","surname":"Bibiloni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mónica","surname":"González","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alicia","surname":"Julibert","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Isabel","surname":"Llompart","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antoni","surname":"Pons","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Josep A.","surname":"Tur","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Josep A.","surname":"Tur","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/nu10060667","date":"2018-05-22","title":"Understanding Eating Behavior during the Transition from Adolescence to Young Adulthood: A Literature Review and Perspective on Future Research Directions","abstract":"Introduction: Eating behavior often becomes unhealthier during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood, but not much is known about the factors that drive this change.\n We assess the available evidence on this topic through a literature review and pay special attention to the research designs employed in the studies available as well as the modifiability of the factors investigated in previous research.\n Method: We systematically conducted a scoping review by searching literature published in or after 2000 in three databases that described one or more factors associated with eating behavior or changes in eating behavior during the transition from adolescence to adulthood in the general population.\n Our search identified eighteen articles meeting these inclusion criteria.\n The socio-ecological DONE (Determinants of Nutrition and Eating) framework, a recently developed dynamic framework of factors shaping dietary behavior, was used to structure and categorize the factors identified.\n Results: Most factors identified in the literature were individual-level factors (67%) such as food beliefs, time constraints, and taste preferences; on the other hand, interpersonal-level factors (e.\ng.\n, social support), environmental-level factors (e.\ng.\n, product characteristics) and policy-level factors (e.\ng.\n, market regulations) have been reported on less extensively.\n Furthermore, most factors discussed in the literature have been classified in the DONE framework as not easily modifiable.\n Moreover, previous studies largely used static research designs and focused primarily on one specific population (US freshmen).\n Discussion: This systematic scoping review identified several gaps in the available literature that hinder insight into the drivers of eating behavior (change) during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood.\n There is an urgent need for research on broader populations, employing dynamic repeated-measures designs, and taking modifiability of factors into account.\n","id":"PMC6024552","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"F.

explorative study was to use a qualitative research design to analyze the factors (barriers and enablers) that US college students perceived as influencing healthy eating behaviors.\n A group of Cornell University students (n = 35) participated in six semi-structured focus groups.\n A qualitative software, CAQDAS Nvivo11 Plus, was used to create codes that categorized the group discussions while using an Ecological Model.\n Common barriers to healthy eating were time constraints, unhealthy snacking, convenience high-calorie food, stress, high prices of healthy food, and easy access to junk food.\n Conversely, enablers to healthy behavior were improved food knowledge and education, meal planning, involvement in food preparation, and being physically active.\n Parental food behavior and friends’ social pressure were considered to have both positive and negative influences on individual eating habits.\n The study highlighted the importance of consulting college students when developing healthy eating interventions across the campus (e.\ng.\n, labeling healthy food options and information campaigns) and considering individual-level factors and socio-ecological aspects in

Content","abstract":"Obesity is a serious and growing health concern worldwide.\n Watching television (TV) represents a condition during which many habitually eat, irrespective of hunger level.\n However, as of yet, little is known about how the content of television programs being watched differentially impacts concurrent eating behavior.\n In this study, eighteen normal-weight female students participated in three counter-balanced experimental conditions, including a ‘Boring’ TV condition (art lecture), an ‘Engaging’ TV condition (Swedish TV comedy series), and a no TV control condition during which participants read (a text on insects living in Sweden).\n Throughout each condition participants had access to both high-calorie (M&amp;Ms) and low-calorie (grapes) snacks.\n We found that, relative to the Engaging TV condition, Boring TV encouraged excessive eating (+52% g, P?=?0.009).\n Additionally, the Engaging TV condition actually resulted in significantly less concurrent intake relative to the control ‘Text’ condition (?35% g, P?=?0.05).\n This intake was driven almost entirely by the healthy snack, grapes; however, this interaction did not reach significance (P?=?0.07).\n Finally, there was a significant correlation between how bored participants were across all conditions, and their concurrent food intake (beta?=?0.317, P?=?0.02).\n Intake as measured by kcals was similarly patterned but did not reach significance.\n These results suggest that, for women, different TV programs elicit different levels of concurrent food intake, and that the degree to which a program is engaging (or alternately, boring) is related to that intake.\n Additionally, they suggest that emotional content (e.\ng.\n boring vs.\n engaging) may be more associated than modality (e.\ng.\n TV vs.\n text) with concurrent intake.\n","id":"PMC4077693","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Colin

during two school years.\n Anthropometric data was collected and body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis.\n Demographic information, sleep duration, pediatric daytime sleepiness questionnaire (PDSS), physical activity and dietary habits (including adherence to the Mediterranean Diet using the KIDMED score) were further collected.\n The mean age was 12±0.7 and about 24% were overweight and obese.\n An inverse correlation between total sleep time and body mass index (?=?0.829, P=0.021), fat mass (?=?0.526, P=0.025), and waist circumference (?=?0.426, P=0.045) was found.\n Similar results were found for weekdays sleep time, while an inverse relationship was found with PDSS score.\n Adherence to Mediterranean Diet was higher in under/normal weight adolescent with a significant linear association between the KIDMED score and the PDSS, weekdays sleep time and total sleep time.\n Sleep duration was also associated positively with fruits and vegetable intake

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

Methods: We recruited 501 individuals aged 35–75 without cardiovascular disease by random sampling (55.90 ± 14.24 years, 49.70% men).\n EVA was defined in two steps: Step 1: subjects with vascular

Percentile 90 were considered EVA and those &lt; Percentile 90 as NVA, with population percentiles analyzed.\n The principal result variable was assessed using the 14-item MEDAS questionnaire,

MDA was observed by 25% (17% men and 34% women).\n EVA was present in 17% (29% men and 4% women).\n The adjusted logistic regression models showed that an increase in MDA decreases the probability of EVA in the global analysis (OR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.16–0.82).\n In the analysis by sex, this association was only seen in men (OR = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.12–0.86), but not in women (OR = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.04–2.50).\n Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet decreases the probability of presenting EVA.\n In the analysis by sex, this association

Choices and Habits during COVID-19 Lockdown: Experience from Poland","abstract":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in late December 2019 in China, which later developed into a pandemic, has forced different countries to implement strict sanitary regimes and social distancing measures.\n Globally, at least four billion people were under lockdown, working remotely, homeschooling children, and facing challenges coping with quarantine and the stressful events.\n The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1097), conducted during a nationwide quarantine, aimed to assess whether nutritional and consumer habits have been affected under these conditions.\n Over 43.0% and nearly 52% reported eating and snacking more, respectively, and these tendencies were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals.\n Almost 30% and over 18% experienced weight gain (mean ± SD 3.0 ± 1.6 kg) and loss (?2.9 ± 1.5 kg), respectively.\n Overweight, obese, and older subjects (aged 36–45 and &gt;45) tended to gain weight more frequently, whereas those with underweight tended to lose it further.\n Increased BMI was associated with less frequent consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes during quarantine, and higher adherence to meat, dairy, and fast-foods.\n An increase in alcohol consumption was seen in 14.6%, with a higher tendency to drink more found among alcohol addicts.\n Over 45% of smokers experienced a rise in smoking frequency during the quarantine.\n The study highlights that lockdown imposed to contain an infectious agent may affect eating behaviors and dietary habits, and advocates for organized nutritional support during future epidemic-related quarantines, particularly for the most vulnerable groups, including overweight and obese subjects.\n","id":"PMC7352682","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Aleksandra","surname":"Sidor","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Piotr","surname":"Rzymski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/nu12061807","date":"2020-06-09","title":"Covid-19

Adherence Screener (MEDAS) as a reference of a healthy diet, processed foods intake, changes in their usual food choices and weight gain was distributed using social media and snowball sampling.\n A total of 7514 participants (37% aged below 35 years, 70.6% female, 77.9% university-level education or higher) from all the Spanish territory completed the questionnaire.\n Results outlined healthier dietary behaviours during the confinement when compared to previous habits.\n Overall, the MEDAS score (ranging from 0 to 14, whereby higher a scoring reflects greater adherence to the MedDiet) increased significantly from 6.53 ± 2 to 7.34 ± 1.93 during the confinement.\n Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender, region and other variables, showed a statistically significant higher likelihood of changing the adherence to the MedDiet (towards an increase in adherence) in those persons who decreased the intake of fried foods, snacks, fast foods, red meat, pastries or sweet beverages, but increased MedDiet-related foods such as olive oil, vegetables, fruits or legumes during the confinement.\n COVID-19 confinement in Spain has led to the adoption of healthier dietary habits/behaviours in the studied population, as reflected by a higher adherence to the MedDiet.\n This improvement, if sustained in the long-term, could have a positive impact on the prevention of chronic diseases and COVID-19-related

this cohort attributed this increase to higher anxiety levels.\n Related to this, 36.8% of responders reported a decrease in alcohol consumption, even though 10.1% of them reported an increase.\n Interestingly, 21.2% of responders increased their consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables.\n Only 33.5% of those who declared decreased consumption attributed this change of diet to lower availability and ease of purchasing such items.\n Equally interesting, over half of responders, i.\ne.\n, 56.2%, admitted that fruit and vegetables did not appeal to them while in lockdown.\n Purchases of ready-made meals were reduced by nearly 50%.\n Future large-scale similar studies should be undertaken worldwide and will help public health authorities shape their reactions to future, unavoidable pandemics.\n","id":"PMC7278864","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Federico","surname":"Scarmozzino","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Francesco","surname":"Visioli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"TrainingInHome-Home-based

intake, changes in their usual food choices and weight gain was distributed using social media and snowball sampling.\n A total of 7514 participants (37% aged below 35 years, 70.6% female, 77.9%

habits.\n Overall, the MEDAS score (ranging from 0 to 14, whereby higher a scoring reflects greater adherence to the MedDiet) increased significantly from 6.53 ± 2 to 7.34 ± 1.93 during the confinement.\n Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender, region and other variables, showed a statistically significant higher likelihood of changing the adherence to the MedDiet (towards an increase in adherence) in those persons who decreased the intake of fried foods, snacks, fast foods, red meat, pastries or sweet beverages, but increased MedDiet-related foods such as olive oil, vegetables, fruits or legumes during the confinement.\n COVID-19 confinement in Spain has led to the adoption of healthier dietary habits/behaviours in the studied population, as

has led many countries to enforce drastic containment measures.\n\n It has been suggested that this abrupt lockdown of populations will foster addiction-related habits such as caloric/salty food intake, screen use, and substance use.\n\n\nObjective\nOur aim was to assess the global changes and factors of increase in addiction-related habits during the early COVID-19 containment phase in France.\n\n\nMethods\nA web-based survey was provided from day 8 to day 13 of the containment and was completed by 11,391 participants.\n\n The questions explored sociodemographic features, psychiatric/addiction history, material conditions of lockdown, general stress, mental well-being, and reported changes in several addiction-related behaviors.\n\n Global changes were described and factors of increase were explored using population-weighted and adjusted logistic regression models, providing adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals.\n\n\nResults\nOverall, the respondents reported more increases in addiction-related habits than decreases, specifically 28.4% (caloric/salty food intake), 64.6% (screen use), 35.6% (tobacco use), 24.8% (alcohol use), and 31.2% (cannabis use).\n\n Reduced well-being scores and increased stress scores were general factors of increase in addiction-related habits (P&lt;.\n\n001 for all habits).\n\n Factors of increase in caloric/salty food intake (n=10,771) were female gender (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.48-1.77), age less than 29 years (P&lt;.\n\n001), having a partner (aOR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.35), being locked down in a more confined space (per 1 square meter/person decrease: aOR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), being locked down alone (aOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49), and reporting current (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.62-2.31) or past (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09-1.47) psychiatric treatment.\n\n Factors of increase in screen use (n=11,267) were female gender (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.21-1.43), age less than 29 years (P&lt;.\n\n001), having no partner (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.32), being employed (P&lt;.\n\n001), intermediate/high education level (P&lt;.\n\n001), being locked down with no access to an outdoor space (aOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.29), being locked down alone (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.32), living in an urban environment (P&lt;.\n\n01), and not working (P&lt;.\n\n001).\n\n Factors of increase in tobacco use (n=2787) were female gender (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.55), having no partner (aOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06-1.59), intermediate/low education level (P&lt;.\n\n01), and still working in the workplace (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.17-1.86).\n\n Factors of increase in alcohol use (n=7108) were age 30-49 years (P&lt;.\n\n05), a high level of education (P&lt;.\n\n001), and current psychiatric treatment (aOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.10-1.88).\n\n The only significant factor of increase in cannabis use (n=620) was intermediate/low level of education (P&lt;.\n\n001).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe early phase of COVID-19 containment in France led to widespread increases in addiction-related habits in the general population.\n\n Reduced well-being and increased stress were universal factors of increase.\n\n More specific factors were associated with increases in each of the explored habits.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7505683","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maha","surname":"El

regimes and social distancing measures.\n Globally, at least four billion people were under lockdown, working remotely, homeschooling children, and facing challenges coping with quarantine and the stressful events.\n The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1097), conducted during a nationwide quarantine, aimed to assess whether nutritional and consumer habits have been affected under these conditions.\n Over 43.0% and nearly 52% reported eating and snacking more, respectively, and these tendencies were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals.\n Almost 30% and over 18% experienced weight gain (mean ± SD 3.0 ± 1.6 kg) and loss (?2.9 ± 1.5 kg), respectively.\n Overweight, obese, and older subjects (aged 36–45 and &gt;45) tended to gain weight more frequently, whereas those with underweight tended to lose it further.\n Increased BMI was associated with less frequent consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes during quarantine, and higher adherence to meat, dairy, and fast-foods.\n An increase in alcohol consumption was seen in 14.6%, with a higher tendency to drink more found among alcohol addicts.\n Over 45% of smokers experienced a rise in smoking frequency during the quarantine.\n The study highlights that lockdown imposed to contain an infectious agent may affect eating behaviors and dietary habits, and advocates for organized nutritional support during future epidemic-related quarantines, particularly for the most vulnerable groups, including overweight and obese

also associated with psychosomatic distress.\n Residents’ strategies for diminishing stigma varied with gender, age, education, occupation, and proximity to perceived risk factors for SARS such as

psychosocial variables and working conditions, and nurses’ coping methods and distress in response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis in Canada.\n\n\nParticipants and procedure\nThe sample consisted of 333 nurses (315 women, 18 men) who completed an Internet-mediated questionnaire that was posted on the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario (RNAO) website between March and May 2004. The questionnaire was restricted to respondents who had to authenticate their RNAO membership with a valid username and password before accessing the questionnaire.\n\n This served a dual purpose: to ensure that only RNAO nurses completed the questionnaire and thereby safeguarding the generalizability of the findings; and second, to prevent any one nurse from contributing more than once to the overall sample.\n\n\nResults\nCorrelational analysis yielded several significant relationships between psychosocial variables and working conditions, and the traditional correlates of burnout and stress.\n\n Three multiple regression analysis revealed that the model we evolved—including higher levels of vigor, organizational support, and trust in equipment/infection control initiative; and lower levels of contact with SARS patients, and time spent in quarantine—predicted to lower levels of avoidance behavior, emotional exhaustion, and state anger.\n\n\nConclusions\nBy employing models of stress and burnout that combine psychosocial variables and working conditions, researchers can account for significant amounts of variance in outcomes related to burnout.\n\n These findings highlight the importance of vigor and perceived organizational support in predicting nurses’ symptoms of burnout.\n\n For healthcare administrators, this means that a likely strategy for assuaging the negative outcomes of stress should address nurses’ psychosocial concerns and the working conditions that they face during novel times of crisis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094220","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zdravko","surname":"Marjanovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Esther R.","surname":"Greenglass","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sue","surname":"Coffey","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: rapid review of the evidence","abstract":"The December, 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility.\n Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence.\n We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases.\n Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review.\n Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger.\n Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma.\n Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects.\n In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided.\n Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.\n","id":"PMC7158942","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Samantha K","surname":"Brooks","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rebecca K","surname":"Webster","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Louise E","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lisa","surname":"Woodland","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Wessely","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neil","surname":"Greenberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gideon James","surname":"Rubin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1017/dmp.2015.38","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Is There a Case for Quarantine?

nurses during the acute phase of the 2003 SARS outbreak, we conducted a prospective and periodic evaluation of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation among nurses in SARS units and non-SARS units.\n Nurse participants were from two SARS units (regular SARS [N = 44] and SARS ICU [N = 26]) and two non-SARS units (Neurology [N = 15] and CCU [N = 17]).\n Participants periodically self-evaluated their depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, sleep disturbance, attitude towards SARS and family support.\n Results showed that depression (38.5% vs.\n 3.1%) and insomnia (37% vs.\n 9.7%) were, respectively, greater in the SARS unit nurses than the non-SARS unit nurses.\n No difference between these two groups was found in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (33% vs.\n 18.7%), yet, three unit subjects (SARS ICU, SARS regular and Neurology) had significantly higher rate than those in CCU (29.7% vs.\n 11.8%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05).\n For the SARS unit nurses, significant reduction in mood ratings, insomnia rate and perceived negative feelings as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of SARS at the end of the study (all p &lt; 0.001) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred.\n The adjustment of nurses in the more structured SARS ICU environment, where nurses care for even more severely ill patients, may have been as good or better than that of nurses in the regular SARS unit.\n Occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was linked to direct exposure to SARS patient care, previous mood disorder history, younger age and perceived negative feelings.\n Positive coping attitude and strong social and family support may have protected against acute stress.\n In conclusion, the psychological impact on the caring staffs facing future bio-disaster will be minimized with lowered risk factors and a safer and more structured work environment.\n","id":"PMC7094424","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tung-Ping","surname":"Su","email":"tpsu@vghtpe.gov.tw","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Te-Cheng","surname":"Lien","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chih-Yi","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yiet

Study Selection: Two researchers independently screened 4303 records, using the PICOS criteria: Participants were aging adults; Intervention was based on acute and/or chronic (poly)phenols-rich supplementation; Comparator was any comparator; Outcomes included cognitive function and neuroprotective measures; and Study design was RCTs.\n A third researcher was consulted when discrepancies arose.\n Fifteen high-quality (mean PEDro score = 8.8 ± 0.56) RCTs (total participants: 918 healthy older adults) were included in the final sample.\n Data Extraction: Information on study design, employed treatment, characteristics of participants, outcomes, and the correspondent assessing methods were extracted.\n Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed.\n Data Analysis and Results: A random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool estimates across studies.\n Effect size (ES) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated.\n Pooled results yielded a trivial ES (?0.2 to 0.03) for brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neuroinflammatory parameters and small (0.36) to moderate (0.82) ES for executive

from individual studies, included in this systematic review, suggest polyphenol-rich supplementation may improve some cognitive and brain functions in older adults.\n The beneficial effect of

ischaemic heart disease other than myocardial infarction (3·04, 2·73–3·39), which includes some misclassified alcohol poisoning.\n\n There were significant excesses of upper aerodigestive tract cancer (3·48, 2·84–4·27) and liver cancer (2·11, 1·64–2·70).\n\n Another five disease groups had RRs of more than 3·00 in the highest alcohol category: tuberculosis (4·14, 3·44–4·98), pneumonia (3·29, 2·83–3·83), liver disease (6·21, 5·16–7·47), pancreatic disease (6·69, 4·98–9·00), and ill-specified conditions (7·74, 6·48–9·25).\n\n Although drinking was less common in women, the RRs associated with it were generally more extreme.\n\n After correction for reporting errors, alcohol-associated excesses accounted for 52% of all study deaths at ages 15–54 years (men 8182 [59%] of 13968, women 1565 [33%] of 4751) and 18% of those at 55–74 years (men 3944 [22%] of 17?536, women 1493 [12%] of 12?302).\n\n Allowance for under-representation of extreme drinkers would further increase alcohol-associated proportions.\n\n Large fluctuations in mortality from these ten strongly alcohol-associated causes were the main determinants of recent fluctuations in overall mortality in the study region and in Russia as a whole.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAlcohol-attributable mortality varies by year; in several recent years, alcohol was a cause of more than half of all Russian deaths at ages 15–54 years.\n\n Alcohol accounts for most of the large fluctuations in Russian mortality, and alcohol and tobacco account for the large difference in adult mortality between Russia and western Europe.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Medical Research Council, Cancer Research UK, British Heart Foundation, International Agency for Research on Cancer, and European Commission Directorate-General for

k-means algorithm was used to determine of patterns of dietary changes, and logistic regression analyses were performed.\n During the study period, 43% of respondents decreased physical activity (PA), 49%—increased screen time, and 34%—increased food consumption.\n Among the three dietary changes patterns, two opposite patterns were found: Prohealthy (28% participants) and Unhealthy (19% participants).\nThe adherence to the Prohealthy pattern was negatively associated with age, but positively with being overweight (aOR 1.31) or obese before pandemic (aOR 1.64).\n Residing in a macroeconomic region with GDP &gt; 100% decreased adherence to the Prohealthy (aOR 0.73) but increased adherence to the Unhealthy pattern (aOR 1.47).\n Adults over 40 years old, those living with children, unemployed, those living in a region with a higher GDP, and those not consuming homemade meals could be more exposed to unhealthy behaviors.\n From a public health perspective, enhancing the

Activity: Results of the ECLB-COVID19 International Online Survey","abstract":"Background: Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home confinement.\n While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined.\n Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions.\n This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours.\n Methods: Following a structured review of the literature, the “Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19)” Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics.\n The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform.\n Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages.\n Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses “before” and “during” confinement conditions.\n Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis.\n The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall).\n Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day.\n Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly.\n Conclusion: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction.\n A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.\n","id":"PMC7352706","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Achraf","surname":"Ammar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Khaled","surname":"Trabelsi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamdi","surname":"Chtourou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Boukhris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liwa","surname":"Masmoudi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bassem","surname":"Bouaziz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ellen","surname":"Bentlage","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniella","surname":"How","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Notger","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Asma","surname":"Aloui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Hammouda","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laisa

strict sanitary regimes and social distancing measures.\n Globally, at least four billion people were under lockdown, working remotely, homeschooling children, and facing challenges coping with quarantine and the stressful events.\n The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1097), conducted during a nationwide quarantine, aimed to assess whether nutritional and consumer habits have been affected under these conditions.\n Over 43.0% and nearly 52% reported eating and snacking more, respectively, and these tendencies were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals.\n Almost 30% and over 18% experienced weight gain (mean ± SD 3.0 ± 1.6 kg) and loss (?2.9 ± 1.5 kg), respectively.\n Overweight, obese, and older subjects (aged 36–45 and &gt;45) tended to gain weight more frequently, whereas those with underweight tended to lose it further.\n Increased BMI was associated with less frequent consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes during quarantine, and higher adherence to meat, dairy, and fast-foods.\n An increase in alcohol consumption was seen in 14.6%, with a higher tendency to drink more found among alcohol addicts.\n Over 45% of smokers experienced a rise in smoking frequency during the quarantine.\n The study highlights that lockdown imposed to contain an infectious agent may affect eating behaviors and dietary habits, and advocates for organized nutritional support during future epidemic-related quarantines, particularly for the most vulnerable groups, including overweight and obese subjects.\n","id":"PMC7352682","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Aleksandra","surname":"Sidor","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Piotr","surname":"Rzymski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/nu12061730","date":"2020-06-08","title":"Changes

Adherence Screener (MEDAS) as a reference of a healthy diet, processed foods intake, changes in their usual food choices and weight gain was distributed using social media and snowball sampling.\n A total of 7514 participants (37% aged below 35 years, 70.6% female, 77.9% university-level education or higher) from all the Spanish territory completed the questionnaire.\n Results outlined healthier dietary behaviours during the confinement when compared to previous habits.\n Overall, the MEDAS score (ranging from 0 to 14, whereby higher a scoring reflects greater adherence to the MedDiet) increased significantly from 6.53 ± 2 to 7.34 ± 1.93 during the confinement.\n Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender, region and other variables, showed a statistically significant higher likelihood of changing the adherence to the MedDiet (towards an increase in adherence) in those persons who decreased the intake of fried foods, snacks, fast foods, red meat, pastries or sweet beverages, but increased MedDiet-related foods such as olive oil, vegetables, fruits or legumes during the confinement.\n COVID-19 confinement in Spain has led to the adoption of healthier dietary habits/behaviours in the studied population, as reflected by a higher adherence to the MedDiet.\n This improvement, if sustained in the long-term, could have a positive impact on the prevention of chronic diseases and COVID-19-related complications.\n","id":"PMC7353108","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Celia","surname":"Rodríguez-Pérez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Esther","surname":"Molina-Montes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Esther","surname":"Molina-Montes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vito","surname":"Verardo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Reyes","surname":"Artacho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Reyes","surname":"Artacho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Belén","surname":"García-Villanova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eduardo

simpler and more predictive than using a ‘matrix’ based on BMI and waist circumference","abstract":"Objectives\nThere is now good evidence that central obesity carries more health risks compared with total obesity assessed by body mass index (BMI).\n\n It has therefore been suggested that waist circumference (WC), a proxy for central obesity, should be included with BMI in a ‘matrix’ to categorise health risk.\n\n We wanted to compare how the adult UK population is classified using such a ‘matrix’ with that using another proxy for central obesity, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), using a boundary value of 0.5. Further, we wished to compare cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with ‘healthy’ BMI divided according to whether they have WHtR below or above 0.5.\nSetting, participants and outcome measures\nRecent data from 4?years (2008–2012) of the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) (n=1453 adults) were used to cross-classify respondents on anthropometric indices.\n\n Regression was used to examine differences in levels of risk factors (triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), TC: HDL, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting glucose, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) according to WHtR below and above 0.5, with adjustment for confounders (age, sex and BMI).\n\n\nResults\n35% of the group who were judged to be at ‘no increased risk’ using the ‘matrix’ had WHtR ?0.5. The ‘matrix’ did not assign ‘increased risk’ to those with a ‘healthy’ BMI and ‘high’ waist circumference.\n\n However, our analysis showed that the group with ‘healthy’ BMI, and WHtR ?0.5, had some significantly higher cardiometabolic risk factors compared to the group with ‘healthy’ BMI but WHtR below 0.5.\nConclusions\nUse of a simple boundary value for WHtR (0.5) identifies more people at ‘early health risk’ than does a more complex ‘matrix’ using traditional boundary values for BMI and WC.\n\n WHtR may be a simpler and more predictive indicator of the ‘early heath risks’ associated with central obesity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4800150","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Margaret","surname":"Ashwell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sigrid","surname":"Gibson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"#TrainingInHome:Home-based training during COVID-19 (SARS-COV2) pandemic: Physical exercise and behavior-based approach","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3389/fimmu.2018.00648","date":"2018-03-15","title":"Debunking the Myth of Exercise-Induced Immune Suppression: Redefining the Impact of Exercise on Immunological Health Across the Lifespan","abstract":"Epidemiological evidence indicates that regular physical activity and/or frequent structured exercise reduces the incidence of many chronic diseases in older age, including communicable diseases such as viral and bacterial infections, as well as non-communicable diseases such as cancer and chronic inflammatory disorders.\n Despite the apparent health benefits achieved by leading an active lifestyle, which imply that regular physical activity and frequent exercise enhance immune competency and regulation, the effect of a single bout of exercise on immune function remains a controversial topic.\n Indeed, to this day, it is perceived by many that a vigorous bout of exercise can temporarily suppress immune function.\n In the first part of this review, we deconstruct the key pillars which lay the foundation to this theory—referred to as the “open window” hypothesis—and highlight that: (i) limited reliable evidence exists to support the claim that vigorous exercise heightens risk of opportunistic infections; (ii) purported changes to mucosal immunity, namely salivary IgA levels, after exercise do not signpost a period of immune suppression; and (iii) the dramatic reductions to lymphocyte numbers and function 1–2?h after exercise reflects a transient and time-dependent redistribution of immune cells to peripheral tissues, resulting in a heightened state of immune surveillance and immune regulation, as opposed to immune suppression.\n In the second part of this review, we provide evidence that frequent exercise enhances—rather than suppresses—immune competency, and highlight key findings from human vaccination studies which show heightened responses to bacterial and viral antigens following bouts of exercise.\n Finally, in the third part of this review, we highlight that regular physical activity and frequent exercise might limit or delay aging of the immune system, providing further evidence that exercise is beneficial for immunological health.\n In summary, the over-arching aim of this review is to rebalance opinion over the perceived relationships between exercise and immune function.\n We emphasize that it is a misconception to label any form of acute exercise as immunosuppressive, and, instead, exercise most likely improves immune competency across the lifespan.\n","id":"PMC5911985","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"John P.","surname":"Campbell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James E.","surname":"Turner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0037696","date":"2012-04-25","title":"Association of Sedentary Time with Mortality Independent of Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity","abstract":"Background\nSedentary behavior has emerged as a novel health risk factor independent of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA).\n\n Previous studies have shown self-reported sedentary time to be associated with mortality;

searched to identify articles published in English from January 1975 to March 2018 that investigated associations between dietary patterns and QoL in older adults.\n Relevant studies were identified based on set inclusion and exclusion criteria, data were extracted and analysed to examine the relationships and possible implications for public health recommendations.\n The systematic review included 15 articles (One randomized control trial, six prospective cohorts and eight cross sectional).\n The studies looked at correlations between different dietary patterns and/or adherence to particular dietary patterns and self-reported QoL or self-rated health status.\n Excluding two studies which showed no significant association, healthy dietary patterns were associated with better self-rated health and QoL in one or more domains, and adherence to healthy dietary patterns like the Mediterranean diet were significantly associated with improvement in at least one of the QoL domains.\n","id":"PMC6115962","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thara","surname":"Govindaraju","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Berhe

Aging","abstract":"With increasing age, the immune system undergoes a remodeling process, termed immunosenescence, which is accompanied by considerable shifts in leukocyte subpopulations and a decline in various immune cell functions.\n Clinically, immunosenescence is characterized by increased susceptibility to infections, a more frequent reactivation of latent viruses, decreased vaccine efficacy, and an increased prevalence of autoimmunity and cancer.\n Physiologically, the immune system has some adaptive strategies to cope with aging, while in some settings, maladaptive responses aggravate the speed of aging and morbidity.\n While a lack of physical activity, decreased muscle mass, and poor nutritional status facilitate immunosenescence and inflammaging, lifestyle factors such as exercise and dietary habits affect immune aging positively.\n This review will discuss the relevance and mechanisms of immunoprotection through physical activity and specific exercise interventions.\n In the second part, we will focus on the effect of dietary interventions through the supplementation of the essential amino acid tryptophan, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and probiotics (with a

of COVID-19 Home Confinement on Eating Behaviour and Physical Activity: Results of the ECLB-COVID19 International Online Survey","abstract":"Background: Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home confinement.\n While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined.\n Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions.\n This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours.\n Methods: Following a structured review of the literature, the “Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19)” Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics.\n The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform.\n Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages.\n Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses “before” and “during” confinement conditions.\n Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis.\n The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall).\n Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day.\n Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly.\n Conclusion: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction.\n A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.\n","id":"PMC7352706","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Achraf","surname":"Ammar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Khaled","surname":"Trabelsi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamdi","surname":"Chtourou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Boukhris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liwa","surname":"Masmoudi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bassem","surname":"Bouaziz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ellen","surname":"Bentlage","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniella","surname":"How","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Notger","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Asma","surname":"Aloui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Hammouda","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laisa
