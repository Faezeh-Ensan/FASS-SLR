consequences has led to fears, worries, and anxiety among individuals worldwide.\n\n The present study developed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to complement the clinical efforts in preventing the spread and treating of COVID-19 cases.\n\n\nMethods\nThe sample comprised 717 Iranian participants.\n\n The items of the FCV-19S were constructed based on extensive review of existing scales on fears, expert evaluations, and participant interviews.\n\n Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain its reliability and validity properties.\n\n\nResults\nAfter panel review and corrected item-total correlation testing, seven items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.47 to 0.56) were retained and further confirmed by significant and strong factor loadings (0.66 to 0.74).\n\n Also, other properties evaluated using both classical test theory and Rasch model were satisfactory on the seven-item scale.\n\n More specifically, reliability values such as internal consistency (? = .\n\n82) and test–retest reliability (ICC = .\n\n72) were acceptable.\n\n Concurrent validity was supported by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (with depression, r = 0.425 and anxiety, r = 0.511) and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (with perceived infectability, r = 0.483 and germ aversion, r = 0.459).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe Fear of COVID-19 Scale, a seven-item scale, has robust psychometric properties.\n\n It is reliable and valid in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general population and will also be useful in allaying COVID-19 fears among individuals.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7100496","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniel

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Outbreaks on the Use of Emergency Department Medical Resources","abstract":"Background\nThe impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 on the emergency department (ED) medical needs of adult patients has not been elucidated.\n\n The purpose of this study was to investigate the demographic and clinical characteristics of ED adult patients before, during and after the SARS epidemic in a SARS-dedicated hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nA retrospective, ED chart review was conducted, and demographic data were obtained from a computer database, for a total of 17,586 patients.\n\n Patient information, including age, gender, mode of arrival, triage category, time of visit, main diagnosis, use of ED services, and status after the ED visit, were collected and compared for pre-, early-, peak-, late-, and post-SARS epidemic stages.\n\n\nResults\nDemographic data demonstrated a significant decrease in patient attendances per day, with a mean reduction of 92.5 ± 8.3 patients (43.7 ± 3.9% reduction in rate; p &lt; 0.01) during peak-versus pre-epidemic stages, but revealed no differences in patient age and gender.\n\n The numbers of patients with ambulance transport, inter-hospital referral, and critical illnesses, including DOA, categorized as triage 1, or admitted to a ward or intensive care unit after the ED visit, were not influenced by the SARS epidemic.\n\n The number of patients with upper airway infections and suicide attempts from drug overdoses increased, but not statistically significantly.\n\n The number of patients with other diagnoses decreased progressively from early- to peak-epidemic stages, but returned to their earlier levels at the post-epidemic stage.\n\n Statistically significant decreases (p &lt; 0.05) were noted in mean attendance at peak-versus pre- and early-epidemic stages for patients with cardiovascular disease, inflammatory or functional bowel disease, endocrine disease, dizziness or vertigo, or trauma.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe SARS outbreak did not eliminate the need of critically ill patients for advanced medical support.\n\n However, besides an overall decrease in patient numbers, the SARS epidemic markedly altered demographic information, clinical characteristics, and the use of medical services by adult patients in the ED of a SARS-dedicated hospital.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7128348","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chien-Cheng","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David

with history of mood disorders and suicide attempts","abstract":"Background\nAnecdotal reports of mood disorder following infection with common respiratory viruses with neurotropic potential have been in existence since the last century.\n\n Nevertheless, systematic studies on the association between these viruses and mood disorders are lacking.\n\n\nMethods\nInfluenza A, B and coronavirus antibody titers were measured in 257 subjects with recurrent unipolar and bipolar disorder and healthy controls, by SCID.\n\n Pearson's ?² tests and logistic regression models were used to analyze associations between seropositivity for coronaviruses, influenza A and B viruses and the following: a) history of recurrent mood disorders b) having attempted suicide in the past c) uni- vs.\n\n bi-polarity and d) presence of psychotic symptoms during mood episodes.\n\n\nResults\nSeropositivity for influenza A (p = 0.004), B (p &lt; 0.0001) and coronaviruses (p &lt; 0.0001) were associated with history of mood disorders but not with the specific diagnosis of unipolar or bipolar depression.\n\n Seropositivity for influenza B was significantly associated with a history of suicide attempt (p =0.001) and history of psychotic symptoms (p =0.005).\n\n\nLimitations\nThe design was cross-sectional.\n\n Socioeconomic factors, inflammatory markers, and axis II psychopathology were not assessed.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe association of seropositivity for influenza and coronaviruses with a history of mood disorders, and influenza B with suicidal behavior require replication in larger longitudinal samples.\n\n The need for these studies is additionally supported by the high incidence of these viral infections, the high prevalence of mood disorders, and resilience of suicide
