trust","abstract":"Aims\nThe SARS?CoV?2 virus binds to the angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cell entry.\n\n It has been suggested that angiotensin?converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and may raise tissue ACE2 levels, could increase the risk of severe COVID?19 infection.\n\n\nMethods and results\nWe evaluated this hypothesis in a consecutive cohort of 1200 acute inpatients with COVID?19 at two hospitals with a multi?ethnic catchment population in London (UK).\n\n The mean age was 68?±?17?years (57% male) and 74% of patients had at least one comorbidity.\n\n Overall, 415 patients (34.6%) reached the primary endpoint of death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 21?days of symptom onset.\n\n A total of 399 patients (33.3%) were taking ACEi or ARB.\n\n Patients on ACEi/ARB were significantly older and had more comorbidities.\n\n The odds ratio for the primary endpoint in patients on ACEi and ARB, after adjustment for age, sex and co?morbidities, was 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.47–0.84, P?&lt;?0.01).\n\n\nConclusions\nThere was no evidence for increased severity of COVID?19 in hospitalised patients on chronic treatment with ACEi or ARB.\n\n A trend towards a beneficial effect of ACEi/ARB requires further evaluation in larger meta?analyses and randomised clinical trials.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7301045","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniel

mechanisms and applications","abstract":"Viral and bacterial infections are involved in the development of human cancers, such as liver, nasopharyngeal, cervical, head and neck, and gastric cancers.\n Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently present in these cancers, and some of the aberrantly methylated genes are causally involved in cancer development and progression.\n Notably, aberrant DNA methylation can be present even in non-cancerous or precancerous tissues, and its levels correlate with the risk of cancer development, producing a so-called ‘epigenetic field for cancerization’.\n Mechanistically, most viral or bacterial infections induce DNA methylation indirectly via chronic inflammation, but recent studies have indicated that some viruses have direct effects on the epigenetic machinery of host cells.\n From a translational viewpoint, a recent multicenter prospective cohort study demonstrated that assessment of the extent of alterations in DNA methylation in non-cancerous tissues can be used to predict cancer risk.\n Furthermore, suppression of aberrant DNA methylation was shown to be a useful strategy for cancer prevention in an animal model.\n Here, we review the involvement of aberrant DNA methylation in various types of infection-associated cancers, along with individual induction mechanisms, and we discuss the application of these findings for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.\n","id":"PMC4731931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Naoko","surname":"Hattori","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Toshikazu","surname":"Ushijima","email":"tushijim@ncc.go.jp","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2559.2011.04033.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prostate

(COVID-19) pandemic.\n Strikingly, men account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, with current figures ranging from 59% to 75% of total mortality.\n However, despite clear implications in relation to COVID-19 mortality, most research has not considered sex as a critical factor in data analysis.\n Here, we highlight fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females, and how these may make significant contributions to the male-biased COVID-19 mortality.\n We present preclinical evidence identifying the influence of biological sex on the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells.\n However, we note that there is a lack of reports showing that sexual dimorphism of ACE2 expression exists and is of functional relevance in humans.\n In contrast, there is strong evidence, especially in the context of viral infections, that sexual dimorphism plays a central role in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses, both of the innate and the adaptive immune system.\n We review evidence supporting that ineffective anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, coupled with a predisposition for inappropriate hyperinflammatory responses, could provide a biological explanation for the male bias in COVID-19 mortality.\n A prominent finding in COVID-19 is the increased risk of death with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and age.\n We contextualize how important features of sexual dimorphism and inflammation in COVID-19 may exhibit a reciprocal relationship with comorbidities, and explain their increased mortality risk.\n Ultimately, we demonstrate that biological sex is a fundamental variable of critical relevance to our mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pursuit of effective COVID-19 preventative and therapeutic strategies.\n","id":"PMC7665363","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura

manifestations, including death.\n\n Several studies and meta-analyses have evaluated the role of hypertension on prognosis, but with important limitations and conflicting results.\n\n Therefore, we decided to perform a new meta-analysis of the observational studies that explored the relationship between pre-existing hypertension and mortality risk in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, using more stringent inclusion criteria to overcome the limitations inherent previous meta-analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic search of the on-line databases available up to 31 March 2022 was conducted, including peer-reviewed original articles, involving the adult population, where the role of hypertension on mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by Cox-proportional hazard models.\n\n Pooled hazard ratio (HR) was calculated by a random effect model.\n\n Sensitivity, heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-six studies (222,083 participants) met the pre-defined inclusion criteria.\n\n In the pooled analysis, pre-existing hypertension was significantly associated with mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, both in unadjusted and adjusted models (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.97).\n\n However, in separate analyses including results adjusted for crucial and strong predictors of mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.\n\ng.\n\n body weight), the association disappeared.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results of this meta-analysis indicate that pre-existing hypertension is not an independent predictor of mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Further studies should nevertheless be carried out worldwide to evaluate this role, independent of, or in interaction with, other confounders that may affect the mortality risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9671636","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lanfranco","surname":"D'Elia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alfonso","surname":"Giaquinto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Aquilino

(ACE2) is a type I integral membrane that exists in two forms: the first is a transmembrane protein; the second is a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2. The catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17), in which calmodulin mediates the calcium signaling pathway that is involved in ACE2 release, resulting in a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 that can be measured as soluble ACE2 plasma activity.\n The shedding of the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain plays a role in cardiac remodeling and endothelial dysfunction and is a predictor of all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular mortality.\n Moreover, considerable evidence supports that the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain is an essential entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Additionally, endotoxins and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF?) all enhanced soluble catalytic ectodomain ACE2 shedding from the airway epithelia, suggesting that the shedding of ACE2 may represent a mechanism by which viral entry and infection may be controlled such as some types of betacoronavirus.\n In this regard, ACE2 plays an important role in inflammation and thrombotic response, and its down-regulation may aggravate COVID-19 via the renin-angiotensin system, including by promoting pathological changes in lung injury.\n Soluble forms of ACE2 have recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Furthermore, given that vitamin D enhanced the shedding of ACE2, some studies reported that vitamin D treatment is associated with prognosis improvement in COVID-19.

The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing.\n The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus.\n The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications.\n Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1–7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system.\n rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively.\n Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.\n","id":"PMC7188049","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mahmoud","surname":"Gheblawi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kaiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anissa","surname":"Viveiros","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Quynh","surname":"Nguyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiu-Chang","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anthony J.","surname":"Turner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mohan K.","surname":"Raizada","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maria B.","surname":"Grant","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gavin Y.","surname":"Oudit","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1161/strokeaha.120.032070","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effects of Life Events and Social Isolation on Stroke and Coronary Heart Disease","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/heartjnl-2019-316250","date":"2020-02-17","title":"Association of social relationships with incident cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality","abstract":"Objective\nTo examine how different aspects of social relationships are associated with incident cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nIn 4139 participants from the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall study without previous cardiovascular disease (mean (SD) age 59.1 (7.7) years, 46.7% men), the association of self-reported instrumental, emotional and financial support and social integration at baseline with incident fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality during 13.4-year follow-up was assessed in five different multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models: minimally adjusted model (adjusting for age, sex, social integration or social support, respectively);

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global health burden.\n Obesity, a metabolic syndrome affecting one-third of the population, has proven to be a major risk factor for COVID-19 severe complications.\n Several studies have identified metabolic signatures and disrupted metabolic pathways associated with COVID-19, however there are no reports evaluating the role of obesity in the COVID-19 metabolic regulation.\n In this study we highlight the involvement of obesity metabolically in affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent health complications, mainly cardiovascular disease.\n We measured one hundred and forty-four (144) metabolites using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) to identify metabolic changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in lean and obese COVID-19 positive (n=82) and COVID-19 negative (n=24) patients.\n The identified metabolites are found to be mainly correlating with glucose, energy and steroid metabolisms.\n Further data analysis indicated twelve (12) significantly yet differentially abundant metabolites associated with viral infection and health complications, in COVID-19 obese patients.\n Two of the detected metabolites, n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol, are detected only among the COVID-19 cohort, exhibiting significantly higher levels in COVID-19 obese patients when compared to COVID-19 lean patients.\n These metabolites have important roles in viral entry and could explain the increased susceptibility of obese patients.\n On the same note, a set of six metabolites associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory functions displayed significantly lower abundance in COVID-19 obese patients.\n In conclusion, this report highlights the plasma metabolome of COVID-19 obese patients as a metabolic feature and signature to help improve clinical outcomes.\n We propose n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol as potential metabolic markers which warrant further investigations to better understand their involvement in different metabolic pathways in

coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of the key determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality.\n SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells is initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection.\n Here, we report that ibudilast, which we previously identified as a potent inhibitor of protein complex between transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 3 and NADPH oxidase (Nox) 2, attenuates the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-evoked contractile and metabolic dysfunctions of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs).\n Epidemiologically reported risk factors of severe COVID-19, including cigarette sidestream smoke (CSS) and anti-cancer drug treatment, commonly upregulate ACE2 expression level, and these were suppressed by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation.\n Exposure of NRCMs to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, as well as CSS and doxorubicin (Dox), induces ATP release through pannexin-1 hemi-channels, and this ATP release potentiates pseudovirus entry to NRCMs and human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs).\n As the pseudovirus entry followed by production of reactive oxygen species was attenuated by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex in hiPS-CMs, we suggest that TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation triggered by panexin1-mediated ATP release participates in exacerbation of myocardial

plateaued and declined.\n\n Obvious downward trends were observed from 29.6 to 2.7% for all-cause mortality (aOR, 0.12; 95%CI, 0.07-0.21; P-value &lt;0.001, P for trend &lt;0.001) and 4.8 to 0.8% for cardio-cerebrovascular mortality (aOR, 0.17; 95%CI, 0.05-0.61; P-value =0.007, P for trend &lt;0.001).\n\n All-cause mortality decreased yearly, whereas cardio-cerebrovascular death increased briefly before declining and stabilizing.\n\n Similarly, the temporal mortality trends in MetS patients of different ages and genders had the same results.\n\n Specifically, the incidence of MetS was higher in women than in men (adjusted P =0.003; OR, 1.14; 95%CI, 1.05-1.24), but the mortality was significantly lower after an average of 7.7 years of follow-up (all-cause mortality, adjusted P &lt;0.001; hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95%CI, 0.57-0.81; cardio-cerebrovascular mortality, adjusted P =0.004; HR, 0.55; 95%CI, 0.37-0.83).\n\n\nConclusion\nFrom 1999 to 2014, the incidence of MetS in U.\n\nS.\n\n adults significantly increased overall, while the mortality rate of MetS had a considerable downward trend.\n\n Both trends showed marked gender differences, being more prevalent and at lower risk in women compared with men.\n\n It is important to identify the factors that will curb the incidence of MetS and decrease mortality, especially in male

(LDL) receptors with a role in cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular disease.\n It has since emerged as a major risk factor (causative gene) for Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.\n Detailed understanding of the structural features of the three isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4), which differ by only a single amino acid interchange, has elucidated their unique functions.\n ApoE2 and apoE4 increase the risk for heart disease: apoE2 increases atherogenic lipoprotein levels (it binds poorly to LDL receptors), and apoE4 increases LDL levels (it binds preferentially to triglyceride-rich, very low density lipoproteins, leading to downregulation of LDL receptors).\n ApoE4 also increases the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, decreases their age of onset, or alters their progression.\n ApoE4 likely causes neurodegeneration secondary to its abnormal structure, caused by an interaction between its carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains, called domain interaction.\n When neurons are stressed or injured, they synthesize apoE to redistribute cholesterol for neuronal repair or remodeling.\n However, because of its altered structure, neuronal apoE4 undergoes neuron-specific proteolysis, generating neurotoxic fragments (12–29 kDa) that escape the secretory pathway and cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal alterations, including tau phosphorylation.\n ApoE4-associated pathology can be prevented by small-molecule structure correctors that block domain interaction by converting apoE4 to a molecule that resembles apoE3 both structurally and functionally.\n Structure correctors are a potential therapeutic approach to reduce apoE4 pathology in both cardiovascular and neurological disorders.\n","id":"PMC4921111","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert

screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation.\n It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.\n Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds,

Role of Platelet-Endothelium Interactions in the Pathogenesis of Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection-Associated Myocardial Injury","abstract":"Cardiovascular dysfunction and disease are common and frequently fatal complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Indeed, from early on during the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic it was recognized that cardiac complications may occur, even in patients with no underlying cardiac disorders, as part of the acute infection, and that these were associated with more severe disease and increased morbidity and mortality.\n The most common cardiac complication is acute cardiac injury, defined by significant elevation of cardiac troponins.\n The potential mechanisms of cardiovascular complications include direct viral myocardial injury, systemic inflammation induced by the virus, sepsis, arrhythmia, myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypercoagulability.\n This review is focused on the prevalence, risk factors and clinical course of COVID-19-related myocardial injury, as well as on current data with regard to disease pathogenesis, specifically the interaction of platelets with the vascular endothelium.\n The latter section includes consideration of the role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in triggering development of a generalized endotheliitis that, in turn, drives intense activation of platelets.\n Most prominently, SARS-CoV-2–induced endotheliitis involves interaction of the viral spike protein with endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) together with alternative mechanisms that involve the nucleocapsid and viroporin.\n In addition, the mechanisms by which activated platelets intensify endothelial activation and dysfunction, seemingly driven by release of the platelet-derived calcium-binding proteins, SA100A8 and SA100A9, are described.\n These events create a SARS-CoV-2–driven cycle of intravascular inflammation and coagulation, which contributes significantly to a poor clinical outcome in patients with severe disease.\n","id":"PMC8854752","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Theresa

characterized by abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\n Though there is some variation in the definition by other health care organization, the differences are minor.\n With the successful conquest of communicable infectious diseases in most of the world, this new non-communicable disease (NCD) has become the major health hazard of modern world.\n Though it started in the Western world, with the spread of the Western lifestyle across the globe, it has become now a truly global problem.\n The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is often more in the urban population of some developing countries than in its Western counterparts.\n The two basic forces spreading this malady are the increase in consumption of high calorie-low fiber fast food and the decrease in physical activity due to mechanized transportations and sedentary form of leisure time activities.\n The syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like type 2 diabetes, coronary diseases, stroke, and other disabilities.\n The total cost of the malady including the cost of health care and loss of potential economic activity is in trillions.\n The present trend is not sustainable unless a magic cure is found (unlikely) or concerted global/governmental/societal efforts are made to change the lifestyle that is promoting it.\n There are certainly some elements in the causation of the metabolic syndrome that cannot be changed but many are amenable for corrections and curtailments.\n For example, better urban planning to encourage active lifestyle, subsidizing consumption of whole grains and possible taxing high calorie snacks, restricting media advertisement of unhealthy food, etc.\n Revitalizing old fashion healthier lifestyle, promoting old-fashioned foods using healthy herbs rather than oil and sugar, and educating people about choosing healthy/wholesome food over junks are among the steps that can be

lungs from a human ACE2 transgenic mouse infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the control infected with mock; human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived liver organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2; adipose tissues from a mouse model of COVID-19 overexpressing human ACE2 via adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) compared to the control GFP after SARS-CoV-2 infection;

ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain.\n ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form.\n An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7.\n Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis.\n The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors.\n Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane.\n Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis.\n Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.\ne.\n, older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency.\n We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions.\n The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the ‘adverse’ ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis and the ‘protective’ ACE2?Angiotensin1-7?Mas receptor axis.\n In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7.\n In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n","id":"PMC7167588","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Verdecchia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claudio","surname":"Cavallini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Spanevello","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fabio","surname":"Angeli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.11.003","date":"2021-11-07","title":"Sex- and age-specific regulation of ACE2: Insights into severe COVID-19 susceptibility","abstract":"Aged males disproportionately succumb to increased COVID-19 severity, hospitalization, and mortality compared to females.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitate SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and may have sexually dimorphic regulation.\n As viral load dictates disease severity, we investigated the expression, protein levels, and activity of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other

We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77).\n\n There was no difference in blood pressure, serum potassium, or creatinine during follow-up across the two groups.\n\n\nInterpretation\nConsistent with international society recommendations, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors can be safely continued in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nFunding\nREPLACE COVID Investigators, REPLACE COVID Trial Social Fundraising Campaign, and

enzyme 2, which can be upregulated by inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS).\n\n We aimed to test our hypothesis that discontinuation of chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and death.\n\n Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04353596.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween April 20, 2020, and Jan 20, 2021, 204 patients (median age 75 years [IQR 66–80], 37% females) were randomly assigned to discontinue (n=104) or continue (n=100) RAS inhibition.\n\n Within 30 days, eight (8%) of 104 died in the discontinuation group and 12 (12%) of 100 patients died in the continuation group (p=0·42).\n\n There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the discontinuation and continuation group (median [IQR] maximum SOFA score 0·00 (0·00–2·00) vs 1·00 (0·00–3·00); p=0·12).\n\n Discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower AUCSOFA (0·00 [0·00–9·25] vs 3·50 [0·00–23·50]; p=0·040), mean SOFA score (0·00 [0·00–0·31] vs 0·12 [0·00–0·78]; p=0·040), and 30-day SOFA score (0·00 [10–90th percentile, 0·00–1·20] vs 0·00 [0·00–24·00]; p=0·023).\n\n At 30 days, 11 (11%) in the discontinuation group and 23 (23%) in the continuation group had signs of organ dysfunction (SOFA score ?1) or were dead (p=0·017).\n\n There were no significant differences for mechanical ventilation (10 (10%) vs 8 (8%), p=0·87) and admission to intensive care unit (20 [19%] vs 18 [18%], p=0·96) between the discontinuation and continuation group.\n\n\nInterpretation\nDiscontinuation of RAS-inhibition in COVID-19 had no significant effect on the maximum severity of COVID-19 but may lead to a faster and better recovery.\n\n The decision

Using data from 228,722 Veterans with a history of hypertension who received COVID-19 testing at the VA, we investigated whether the use of ACEI or ARB over the two years prior to the index date was associated with increased odds of (1) a positive COVID-19 test, and (2) a severe outcome (hospitalization, mortality, and use of intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation) among COVID-19-positive patients.\n\n We used logistic regression with and without propensity score weighting (PSW) to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association between ACEI/ARB use and a positive COVID-19 test result.\n\n The association between medication use and COVID-19 outcome severity was examined using multinomial logistic regression comparing participants who were not hospitalized to participants who were hospitalized, were admitted to the ICU, used a mechanical ventilator, or died.\n\n All models were adjusted for relevant covariates, including demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), selected comorbidities, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).\n\n\nResults\nThe use of ACEI significantly decreased the odds of a positive COVID-19 test among Veterans with hypertension (OR = 0.917, (0.887, 0.948) and OR = 0.926, (0.894, 0.958) with PSW).\n\n The use of ACEI, but not of ARB, was also associated with significantly increased odds of using mechanical ventilators (OR = 1.265, (1.010, 1.584) and OR = 1.210, (1.053, 1.39) with PSW) among all COVID-19 inpatients compared to outpatients.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study of Veterans with hypertension, ACEI was significantly associated with decreased odds of testing positive for COVID-19.

throughout China.\n\n This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1st to February 5th.\n\n The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P&lt;0.05).\n\n Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P&lt;0.05).\n\n After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P&lt;0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.\n\n\nConclusion\nNearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization.\n\n The patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184444","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pingzheng","surname":"Mo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuanyuan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liping","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qiu","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongling","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shicheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mingqi","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tielong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shihui","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiying","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qian","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wang","email":"fanndywang@foxmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongxi","surname":"Zhang","email":"znact1936@126.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Characteristics

Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.\n] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications.\n Preventive measures (social distancing and social isolation) also increase cardiovascular risk.\n Cardiovascular considerations of therapies currently used, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, ribavirin, interferons, and lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as experimental therapies, such as human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2), are discussed.\n","id":"PMC7197627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tomasz

A first step in understanding SARS pathogenesis","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route.\n A distinct coronavirus (SARS?CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS.\n Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n Published by John Wiley &amp;

and we consider the possibility of inferring information despite de-identification.\n\n\nResults\nTrue PIs were masked with 98.8% precision and 97.6% recall.\n\n As anticipated, potential PIs did appear, owing to misspellings entered within the EHRs.\n\n We found one potential breach.\n\n In a separate performance test, with a different set of notes, CRIS yielded 100% precision and 88.5% recall, while MIST yielded a 95.1% and 78.1%, respectively.\n\n We discuss how we overcome the realistic possibility – albeit of low probability – of potential breaches through implementation of the security model.\n\n\nConclusion\nCRIS is a de-identified psychiatric database sourced from EHRs, which protects patient anonymity and maximises data available for research.\n\n CRIS demonstrates the advantage of combining an effective de-identification algorithm with a carefully designed security model.\n\n The paper advances much needed discussion of EHR de-identification – particularly in relation to criteria to assess de-identification, and considering the contexts of de-identified research databases when assessing the risk of breaches of confidential patient information.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3751474","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Andrea C","surname":"Fernandes","email":"andrea.1.fernandes@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Danielle","surname":"Cloete","email":"dcloete@hotmail.co.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew TM","surname":"Broadbent","email":"matthew.broadbent@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard D","surname":"Hayes","email":"Richard.hayes@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chin-Kuo","surname":"Chang","email":"chin-kuo.chang@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard G","surname":"Jackson","email":"richard.g.jackson@slam.nhs.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Angus","surname":"Roberts","email":"a.roberts@sheffield.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jason","surname":"Tsang","email":"jason.tsang@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Murat","surname":"Soncul","email":"murat.soncul@slam.nhs.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jennifer","surname":"Liebscher","email":"Jennifer.liebscher@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Stewart","email":"Robert.stewart@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Felicity","surname":"Callard","email":"felicity.callard@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000183","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Automated concept-level information extraction to reduce the need for custom software and rules development","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"An Overview of the Tesseract OCR Engine","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0112774","date":"2014-10-18","title":"Negation’s Not Solved: Generalizability Versus Optimizability in Clinical Natural Language Processing","abstract":"A review of published work in clinical natural language processing (NLP) may suggest that the negation detection task has been “solved.\n” This work proposes that an optimizable solution does not equal a generalizable solution.\n We introduce a new machine learning-based Polarity Module for detecting negation in clinical text, and extensively compare its performance across domains.\n Using four manually annotated corpora of clinical text, we show that negation detection performance suffers when there is no in-domain development (for manual methods) or training data (for machine learning-based methods).\n Various factors (e.\ng.\n, annotation guidelines, named entity characteristics, the amount of data, and lexical and syntactic context) play a role in making generalizability difficult, but none completely explains the phenomenon.\n Furthermore, generalizability remains challenging because it is unclear whether to use a single source for accurate data, combine all sources into a single model, or apply domain adaptation methods.\n The most reliable means to improve negation detection is to manually annotate in-domain training data (or, perhaps, manually modify rules);

sequencing, imaging, sensor, societal and publicly available data present a rapidly expanding digital trace of health.\n\n We aimed to critically review, for the first time, the challenges and potential of big data across early and late stages of translational cardiovascular disease research.\n\n\nMethods and results\nWe sought exemplars based on literature reviews and expertise across the BigData@Heart Consortium.\n\n We identified formidable challenges including: data quality, knowing what data exist, the legal and ethical framework for their use, data sharing, building and maintaining public trust, developing standards for defining disease, developing tools for scalable, replicable science and equipping the clinical and scientific work force with new inter-disciplinary skills.\n\n Opportunities claimed for big health record data include: richer profiles of health and disease from birth to death and from the molecular to the societal scale; accelerated understanding of disease causation and progression, discovery of new mechanisms and treatment-relevant disease sub-phenotypes, understanding health and diseases in whole populations and whole health systems and returning actionable feedback loops to improve (and potentially disrupt) existing models of research and care, with greater efficiency.\n\n In early translational research we identified exemplars including: discovery of fundamental biological processes e.\n\ng.\n\n linking exome sequences to lifelong electronic health records (EHR) (e.\n\ng.\n\n human knockout experiments); drug development: genomic approaches to drug target validation; precision medicine: e.\n\ng.\n\n DNA integrated into hospital EHR for pre-emptive pharmacogenomics.\n\n In late translational research we identified exemplars including: learning health systems with outcome trials integrated into clinical care; citizen driven health with 24/7 multi-parameter patient monitoring to improve outcomes and population-based linkages of multiple EHR sources for higher resolution clinical epidemiology and public health.\n\n\nConclusion\nHigh volumes of inherently diverse (‘big’) EHR data are beginning to

collection at the point of care.\n\n However, as the significance of the modern information economy expands in scope and permeates the healthcare domain, there is an increasing urgency for healthcare organisations to offer information systems that address the expectations of clinicians, researchers and the business intelligence community alike.\n\n Amongst other emergent requirements, the principal unmet need might be defined as the 3R principle (right data, right place, right time) to address deficiencies in organisational data flow while retaining the strict information governance policies that apply within the UK National Health Service (NHS).\n\n Here, we describe our work on creating and deploying a low cost structured and unstructured information retrieval and extraction architecture within King’s College Hospital, the management of governance concerns and the associated use cases and cost saving opportunities that such components present.\n\n\nResults\nTo date, our CogStack architecture has processed over 300 million lines of clinical data, making it available for internal service improvement projects at King’s College London.\n\n On generated data designed to simulate real world clinical text, our de-identification algorithm achieved up to 94% precision and up to 96% recall.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe describe a toolkit which we feel is of huge value to the UK (and beyond) healthcare community.\n\n It is the only open source, easily deployable solution designed for the UK healthcare environment, in a landscape populated by expensive proprietary systems.\n\n

informaticians and electronic health record systems around the world.\n Its detailed descriptions of clinical abnormalities and computable disease definitions have made HPO the de facto standard for deep phenotyping in the field of rare disease.\n The HPO’s interoperability with other ontologies has enabled it to be used to improve diagnostic accuracy by incorporating model organism data.\n It also plays a key role in the popular Exomiser tool, which identifies potential disease-causing variants from whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing data.\n Since the HPO was first introduced in 2008, its users have become both more numerous and more diverse.\n To meet these emerging needs, the project has added new content, language translations, mappings and computational tooling, as well as integrations with external community data.\n The HPO continues to collaborate with clinical adopters to improve specific areas of the ontology and extend standardized disease descriptions.\n The newly redesigned HPO website (www.\nhuman-phenotype-ontology.\norg) simplifies browsing terms and exploring clinical features, diseases, and human

Risk Score focusing on older people in acute care settings using electronic hospital records: an observational study","abstract":"Background\nOlder people are increasing users of health care globally.\n\n We aimed to establish whether older people with characteristics of frailty and who are at risk of adverse health-care outcomes could be identified using routinely collected data.\n\n\nMethods\nA three-step approach was used to develop and validate a Hospital Frailty Risk Score from International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes.\n\n First, we carried out a cluster analysis to identify a group of older people (?75 years) admitted to hospital who had high resource use and diagnoses associated with frailty.\n\n Second, we created a Hospital Frailty Risk Score based on ICD-10 codes that characterised this group.\n\n Third, in separate cohorts, we tested how well the score predicted adverse outcomes and whether it identified similar groups as other frailty tools.\n\n\nFindings\nIn the development cohort (n=22?139), older people with frailty diagnoses formed a distinct group and had higher non-elective hospital use (33·6 bed-days over 2 years compared with 23·0 bed-days for the group with the next highest number of bed-days).\n\n In the national validation cohort (n=1?013?590), compared with the 429?762 (42·4%) patients with the lowest risk scores, the 202?718 (20·0%) patients with the highest Hospital Frailty Risk Scores had increased odds of 30-day mortality (odds ratio 1·71, 95% CI 1·68–1·75), long hospital stay (6·03, 5·92–6·10), and 30-day readmission (1·48, 1·46–1·50).\n\n The c statistics (ie, model discrimination) between individuals for these three outcomes were 0·60, 0·68, and 0·56, respectively.\n\n The Hospital Frailty Risk Score showed fair overlap with dichotomised Fried and Rockwood scales (kappa scores 0·22, 95% CI 0·15–0·30 and 0·30, 0·22–0·38, respectively) and moderate agreement with the Rockwood Frailty Index (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0·41, 95% CI 0·38–0·47).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe Hospital Frailty Risk Score provides hospitals and health systems with a low-cost, systematic way to screen for frailty and identify a group of patients who are at greater risk of adverse outcomes and for whom a frailty-attuned approach might be useful.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute for Health

United States Community Practice: Findings From the ORBIT?AF Registry","abstract":"Background\nThe prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) continues to increase; however, there are limited data describing the division of care among practitioners in the community and whether care differs depending on provider specialty.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nUsing the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT?AF) Registry, we described patient characteristics and AF management strategies in ambulatory clinic practice settings, including electrophysiology (EP), general cardiology, and primary care.\n\n A total of 10 097 patients were included; of these, 1544 (15.3%) were cared for by an EP provider, 6584 (65.2%) by a cardiology provider, and 1969 (19.5%) by an internal medicine/primary care provider.\n\n Compared with those patients who were cared for by cardiologists or internal medicine/primary care providers, patients cared for by EP providers were younger (median age, 73 years [interquartile range, IQR, 64, 80 years, Q1, Q3] versus 75 years [IQR, 67, 82 years] for cardiology and versus 76 years [IQR, 68, 82 years] for primary care).\n\n Compared with cardiology and internal medicine/primary care providers, EP providers used rhythm control (versus rate control) management more often (44.2% versus 29.7% and 28.8%, respectively, P&lt;0.0001; adjusted odds ratio [OR] EP versus cardiology, 1.66 [95% confidence interval, CI, 1.05 to 2.61]; adjusted OR for internal medicine/primary care versus cardiology, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.26]).\n\n Use of oral anticoagulant therapy was high across all providers, although it was higher for cardiology and EP providers (overall, 76.1%; P=0.02 for difference between groups).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data demonstrate important differences between provider specialties, the demographics of the AF patient population treated, and treatment strategies—particularly for rhythm control and anticoagulation therapy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3828776","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emil L.","surname":"Fosbol","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"DaJuanicia

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in

Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan

respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without

outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.\n One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses.\n Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV.\n This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework,

acute lung injury","abstract":"Since March 2013, the emergence of an avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus has raised concern in China.\n Although most infections resulted in respiratory illness, some severe cases resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a severe form of acute lung injury (ALI) that further contributes to morbidity.\n To date, no effective drugs that improve the clinical outcome of influenza A (H7N9) virus-infected patients have been identified.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are involved in several pathologies such as cardiovascular functions, renal disease, and acute lung injury.\n In the current study, we report that ACE2 could mediate the severe acute lung injury induced by influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in an experimental

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7206933","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Mancia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Federico","surname":"Rea","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Monica","surname":"Ludergnani","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Monica","surname":"Ludergnani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giovanni","surname":"Apolone","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

coronavirus (SARS?CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS.\n Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004

disorders.\n Recent evidence suggests that an upregulation of ACE2 can be stimulated by all?trans retinoic acid (at?RA); however, at?RA also affects regulation of the stem?cell marker octomer?4 (Oct?4) and thus cellular differentiation.\n We have previously shown that smooth muscle cells and macrophages present within rabbit atherosclerotic plaques are positive for ACE2, Oct?4 and the

Thus, to provide evidence that possible at?RA treatment could affect both plaque cellular biology (via effects on cellular differentiation) and blood pressure (via ACE2), it is vital to show that cells with atherosclerotic plaques co?express all three markers.\n Thus, we sought to provide evidence that a subset of cells within atherosclerotic plaques is positive for ACE2, Oct?4 and CD34. We used New Zealand White rabbits that were fed a control diet supplemented with 0.5% cholesterol plus 1% methionine for 4 weeks and then allowed to consume a normal diet for 10 weeks.\n Immunohistochemistry was performed by standard techniques.\n We report that ACE2, Oct?4 and CD34 were all present within atherosclerotic plaques.\n Although macrophages were positive for all three markers, spindle?shaped cells in the media did not show all three markers.\n The endothelium overlying normal arterial wall showed positive Oct?4 and ACE2 immunoreactivity, but CD34 immunoreactivity was patchy, indicating that such cells might not have fully differentiated.\n It is concluded that cells in atherosclerotic plaques express co?express ACE2, Oct?4 and CD34.

Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.\n One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses.\n Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV.\n This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework,

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov,

(continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.\n A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by SARS.\n","id":"PMC6181990","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Doreen","surname":"Muth","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Victor

infections in adults and children.\n While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.\n This scenario provides important ecological parallels to the present prepandemic pattern of host

disproportionately affect people with cardiovascular disease.\n\n Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020.\nResults\nOf the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge.\n\n The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs.\n\n 4.9% among those ?65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs.\n\n 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs.\n\n 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs.\n\n 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs.\n\n 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs.\n\n 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47).\n\n No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs.\n\n 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs.\n\n 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.\n\n (Funded by the William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Advanced Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7206931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mandeep R.","surname":"Mehra","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Sapan S.","surname":"Desai","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sapan S.","surname":"Desai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"SreyRam","surname":"Kuy","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"SreyRam","surname":"Kuy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy D.","surname":"Henry","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                          Amit N.","surname":"Patel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cardiovascular implications of fatal outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1002/jmv.25678","date":"2020-01-15","title":"Outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China: The mystery and the miracle","abstract":"","id":"PMC7166628","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hongzhou","surname":"Lu","email":"luhongzhou@fudan.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charles W.","surname":"Stratton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi?Wei","surname":"Tang","email":"yi-wei.tang@cepheid.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ijid.2020.01.009","date":"2019-01-13","title":"The continuing 2019-nCoV epidemic threat of novel coronaviruses to global health — The latest 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China","abstract":"","id":"PMC7128332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David S.","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Esam","surname":"I Azhar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Esam","surname":"I Azhar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tariq A.","surname":"Madani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tariq A.","surname":"Madani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Francine","surname":"Ntoumi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Francine","surname":"Ntoumi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Kock","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Kock","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Osman","surname":"Dar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Osman","surname":"Dar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Ippolito","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Ippolito","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy D.","surname":"Mchugh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy D.","surname":"Mchugh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ziad A.","surname":"Memish","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ziad A.","surname":"Memish","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alimuddin","surname":"Zumla","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alimuddin","surname":"Zumla","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eskild","surname":"Petersen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eskild","surname":"Petersen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.0757","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus infections: more than just the common cold","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.

less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaolin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xingwang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuelei","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangfa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongmeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Wang","email":"wangjw28@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"caobin_ben@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1585","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":" Clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected.

pandemic.\n\n We conducted a serologic survey to estimate the cumulative incidence of A(H1N1)pdm09 through the end of 2009 when pandemic activity had waned in the United States.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a pair of cross sectional serologic surveys before and after the spring/fall waves of the pandemic for evidence of seropositivity (titer ?40) using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay.\n\n We tested a baseline sample of 1,142 serum specimens from the 2007–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and 2,759 serum specimens submitted for routine screening to clinical diagnostic laboratories from ten representative sites.\n\n\nResults\nThe age-adjusted prevalence of seropositivity to A(H1N1)pdm09 by year-end 2009 was 36.9% (95%CI: 31.7–42.2%).\n\n After adjusting for baseline cross-reactive antibody, pandemic vaccination coverage and the sensitivity/specificity of the HI assay, we estimate that 20.2% (95%CI: 10.1–28.3%) of the population was infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 by December 2009, including 53.3% (95%CI: 39.0–67.1%) of children aged 5–17 years.\n\n\nConclusions\nBy December 2009, approximately one-fifth of the US population, or 61.9 million persons, may have been infected with A(H1N1)pdm09, including around half of school-aged

systems declines with media attention because media attention increases “chatter” – messages that are about influenza but that do not pertain to an actual infection – masking signs of true influenza prevalence.\n This paper summarizes our recently developed influenza infection detection algorithm that automatically distinguishes relevant tweets from other chatter, and we describe our current influenza surveillance system which was actively deployed during the full 2012-2013 influenza season.\n Our objective was to analyze the performance of this system during the most recent 2012–2013 influenza season and to analyze the performance at multiple levels of geographic granularity, unlike past studies that focused on national or regional surveillance.\n Our system’s influenza prevalence estimates were strongly correlated with surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the United States (r = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001) as well as surveillance data from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene of New York City (r = 0.88, p &lt; 0.001).\n Our system detected the weekly change in direction (increasing or decreasing) of influenza prevalence with 85% accuracy, a nearly twofold increase over a simpler model, demonstrating the utility of explicitly distinguishing infection tweets from other chatter.\n","id":"PMC3857320","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Broniatowski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael

mechanisms and applications","abstract":"Viral and bacterial infections are involved in the development of human cancers, such as liver, nasopharyngeal, cervical, head and neck, and gastric cancers.\n Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently present in these cancers, and some of the aberrantly methylated genes are causally involved in cancer development and progression.\n Notably, aberrant DNA methylation can be present even in non-cancerous or precancerous tissues, and its levels correlate with the risk of cancer development, producing a so-called ‘epigenetic field for cancerization’.\n Mechanistically, most viral or bacterial infections induce DNA methylation indirectly via chronic inflammation, but recent studies have indicated that some viruses have direct effects on the epigenetic machinery of host cells.\n From a translational viewpoint, a recent multicenter prospective cohort study demonstrated that assessment of the extent of alterations in DNA methylation in non-cancerous tissues can be used to predict cancer risk.\n Furthermore, suppression of aberrant DNA methylation was shown to be a useful strategy for cancer prevention in an animal model.\n Here, we review the involvement of aberrant DNA methylation in various types of infection-associated cancers, along with individual induction mechanisms, and we discuss the application of these findings for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.\n","id":"PMC4731931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Naoko","surname":"Hattori","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Toshikazu","surname":"Ushijima","email":"tushijim@ncc.go.jp","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2559.2011.04033.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prostate

Review of Classical and New Paradigms","abstract":"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is well-recognized as one of the oldest and most important regulators of arterial blood pressure, cardiovascular, and renal function.\n New frontiers have recently emerged in the RAS research well beyond its classic paradigm as a potent vasoconstrictor, an aldosterone release stimulator, or a sodium-retaining hormone.\n First, two new members of the RAS have been uncovered, which include the renin/(Pro)renin receptor (PRR) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n Recent studies suggest that prorenin may act on the PRR independent of the classical ACE/ANG II/AT1 receptor axis, whereas ACE2 may degrade ANG II to generate ANG (1–7), which activates the Mas receptor.\n Second, there is increasing evidence that ANG II may function as an intracellular peptide to activate intracellular and/or nuclear receptors.\n Third, currently there is a debate on the relative contribution of systemic versus intrarenal RAS to the physiological regulation of blood pressure and the development of hypertension.\n The objectives of this article are to review and discuss the new insights and perspectives derived from recent studies using novel transgenic mice that either overexpress or are deficient of one key enzyme, ANG peptide, or receptor of the RAS.\n This information may help us better understand how ANG II acts, both independently or through interactions with other members of the system, to regulate the kidney function and blood pressure in health and disease.\n","id":"PMC3822323","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jia L.","surname":"Zhuo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fernanda

mediated by inhibition of perivascular and plaque inflammation in early atherosclerosis","abstract":"Background and Purpose\nInflammation plays a key role in atherosclerosis.\n\n The protective role of angiotensin 1–7 (Ang?(1–7)) in vascular pathologies suggested the therapeutic use of low MW, non?peptide Ang?(1–7) mimetics, such as AVE0991. The mechanisms underlying the vaso?protective effects of AVE0991, a Mas receptor agonist, remain to be explored.\n\n\nExperimental Approach\nWe investigated the effects of AVE0991 on the spontaneous atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)?/? mice, in the context of vascular inflammation and plaque stability.\n\n\nKey Results\nAVE0991 has significant anti?atherosclerotic properties in ApoE?/? mice and increases plaque stability, by reducing plaque macrophage content, without effects on collagen.\n\n Using the descending aorta of chow?fed ApoE?/? mice, before significant atherosclerotic plaque develops, we gained insight to early events in atherosclerosis.\n\n Interestingly, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and adventitial infiltration with macrophages and T?cells precedes atherosclerotic plaque or the impairment of endothelium?dependent NO bioavailability (a measure of endothelial function).\n\n AVE0991 inhibited perivascular inflammation, by reducing chemokine expression in PVAT and through direct actions on monocytes/macrophages inhibiting their activation, characterized by production of IL?1?, TNF??, CCL2 and CXCL10, and differentiation to M1 phenotype.\n\n Pretreatment with AVE0991 inhibited migration of THP?1 monocytes towards supernatants of activated adipocytes (SW872).\n\n Mas receptors were expressed in PVAT and in THP?1 cells in vitro, and the anti?inflammatory effects of AVE0991 were partly Mas dependent.\n\n\nConclusions and Implications\nThe selective Mas receptor agonist AVE0991 exhibited anti?atherosclerotic and anti?inflammatory actions, affecting monocyte/macrophage differentiation and recruitment to the perivascular space during early stages of atherosclerosis in ApoE?/? mice.\n\n\nLinked Articles\nThis

2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

priming by host cell proteases.\n Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets.\n Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.\n A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option.\n Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.\n Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.\n","id":"PMC7102627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Markus","surname":"Hoffmann","email":"mhoffmann@dpz.eu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hannah","surname":"Kleine-Weber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Schroeder","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nadine","surname":"Krüger","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tanja","surname":"Herrler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sandra","surname":"Erichsen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tobias

cells exposed to angiotensin II (Ang II), leading to endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disorders.\n Since von Willebrand Factor (vWF) blockade improves endothelial function in coronary patients, we hypothesized that targeting endothelial vWF with short interference RNA (siRNA) prevents Ang II-induced ET-1 upregulation.\n Nearly 65?±?2% silencing of vWF in porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAOECs) was achieved with vWF-specific siRNA without affecting cell viability and growth.\n While showing ET-1 similar to wild type cells at rest, vWF-silenced cells did not present ET-1 upregulation during exposure to Ang II (100?nM/24?h), preserving levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity similar to wild type.\n vWF silencing prevented AngII-induced increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) activity and superoxide anion (O2?) levels, known triggers of ET-1 expression.\n Moreover, no increase in O2? or ET-1 levels was found in silenced cells treated with AngII or NOX-agonist phorbol ester (PMA 5?nM/48?h).\n Finally, vWF was required for overexpression of NOX4 and NOX2 in response to AngII and PMA.\n In conclusion, endothelial vWF knockdown prevented Ang II-induced ET-1 upregulation through attenuation of NOX-mediated O2? production.\n Our findings reveal a new role of vWF in preventing of Ang II-induced

in the pathophysiology of coronary heart disease.\n The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2-angiotensin-(1–7) [Ang (1–7)]-Mas receptor (MasR) axis is a key regulator in myocardial remodeling and development of heart failure.\n To investigate how ACE2-Ang-(1–7)-MasR axis function on myocardial remodeling and cardiac fibrosis in post-myocardial infarction (MI), male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight, 200±20 g) were used to establish the model of myocardial infarction by ligating the left coronary artery.\n The present study suggests that telmisartan (Tel) and olmesartan (Olm) (5 mg/kg/d) can inhibit myocardial remodeling of post-myocardial infarction through the ACE2-Ang (1–7)-MasR pathway.\n Administration of Tel or Olm was demonstrated to significantly inhibit collagen deposition using Masson staining.\n In addition, telmisartan and olmesartan was indicated to antagonize angiotensin II (Ang II) and upregulate ACE2, MasR, Ang (1–7) expression in myocardial tissue using immunoassay and ELISA test, and the effect of Olm was more marked than that of Tel at the same dosage.\n Simultaneously, compared with the MI or Sham group, the mRNA and protein expression of ACE2, Ang II and MasR in myocardial tissue demonstrated a remarkable increase in the Olm group, when compared with the Tel group.\n Taken together, our data demonstrated that ACE2-Ang (1–7)-MasR axis may present a potential protective role in the development of myocardial remodeling and may provide a new target for drug development of cardiac fibrosis.\n In conclusion, Olm is superior to Tel in inhibiting myocardial local Ang II level reducing myocardial collagen deposition and improving myocardial remodeling by upregulating the expression of ACE2, Ang (1–7) and

infection","abstract":"Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors mediate the entry into the cell of three strains of coronavirus: SARS-CoV, NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain.\n ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form.\n An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7.\n Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis.\n The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors.\n Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane.\n Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis.\n Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.\ne.\n, older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency.\n We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions.\n The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the ‘adverse’ ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis and the ‘protective’ ACE2?Angiotensin1-7?Mas receptor axis.\n In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7.\n In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n","id":"PMC7167588","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Verdecchia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claudio","surname":"Cavallini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Spanevello","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fabio","surname":"Angeli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.yexmp.2019.104350","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ACE2

Patients with severe COVID-19 infections commonly are older and have a history of hypertension.\n Almost 75% of patients who have died in the pandemic in Italy had hypertension.\n This raised multiple questions regarding a more severe course of COVID-19 in relation to hypertension itself as well as its treatment with renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, e.\ng.\n angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).\n We provide a critical review on the relationship of hypertension, RAS, and risk of lung injury.\n We demonstrate lack of sound evidence that hypertension per se is an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Interestingly, ACEIs and ARBs may be associated with lower incidence and/or improved outcome in patients with lower respiratory tract infections.\n We also review in detail the molecular mechanisms linking the RAS to lung damage and the potential clinical impact of treatment with RAS blockers in patients with COVID-19 and a high cardiovascular and renal risk.\n This is related to the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, and expression of ACE2 in the lung, cardiovascular system, kidney, and other tissues.\n In summary, a critical review of available evidence does not support a deleterious effect of RAS blockers in COVID-19 infections.\n Therefore, there is currently no reason to discontinue RAS blockers in stable patients facing the COVID-19 pandemic.\n ","id":"PMC7184480","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Reinhold","surname":"Kreutz","email":"reinhold.kreutz@charite.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Engi Abd El-Hady","surname":"Algharably","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Engi Abd El-Hady","surname":"Algharably","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michel","surname":"Azizi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Piotr","surname":"Dobrowolski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tomasz","surname":"Guzik","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tomasz","surname":"Guzik","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrzej","surname":"Januszewicz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexandre","surname":"Persu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Aleksander","surname":"Prejbisz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Aleksander","surname":"Prejbisz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas Günther","surname":"Riemer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas Günther","surname":"Riemer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-Guang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michel","surname":"Burnier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michel","surname":"Burnier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Fehr AR, Perlman S (2015) Coronaviruses: an overview of their replication and pathogenesis.

This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly.\n Many of those patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers.\n Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.\n The present article discusses this concept.\n ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels.\n As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II.\n ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes.\n Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs.\n Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans.\n Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.\n In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.\n","id":"PMC7225046","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"A.H.

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

Owing to the nosocomial nature of the outbreak, it is particularly important to gain a better understanding of the epidemiological determinants characterizing the risk of MERS death in order to predict the heterogeneous risk of death in medical settings.\n\n\nMethods\nWe have devised a novel statistical model that identifies the risk of MERS death during the outbreak in real time.\n\n While accounting for the time delay from illness onset to death, risk factors for death were identified using a linear predictor tied to a logit model.\n\n We employ this approach to (1) quantify the risks of death and (2) characterize the temporal evolution of the case fatality ratio (CFR) as case ascertainment greatly improved during the course of the outbreak.\n\n\nResults\nSenior persons aged 60 years or over were found to be 9.3 times (95 % confidence interval (CI), 5.3–16.9) more likely to die compared to younger MERS cases.\n\n Patients under treatment were at a 7.8-fold (95 % CI, 4.0–16.7) significantly higher risk of death compared to other MERS cases.\n\n The CFR among patients aged 60 years or older under treatment was estimated at 48.2 % (95 % CI, 35.2–61.3) as of July 31, 2015, while the CFR among other cases was estimated to lie below 15 %.\n\n From June 6, 2015, onwards, the CFR declined 0.3-fold (95 % CI, 0.1–1.1) compared to the earlier epidemic period, which may perhaps reflect enhanced case ascertainment following major contact tracing efforts.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe risk of MERS death was significantly associated with older age as well as treatment for underlying diseases after explicitly adjusting for the delay between illness onset and death.\n\n Because MERS outbreaks are greatly amplified in the healthcare setting, enhanced infection control practices in medical facilities should strive to shield risk groups from MERS exposure.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4588253","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kenji","surname":"Mizumoto","email":"mizumotokenji@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Akira","surname":"Endo","email":"akr.endo@outlook.jp","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Gerardo","surname":"Chowell","email":"gchowell@gsu.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuichiro","surname":"Miyamatsu","email":"yuichiromiyamatsu@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Masaya","surname":"Saitoh","email":"saitohm@ism.ac.jp","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hiroshi","surname":"Nishiura","email":"nishiurah@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1097/JTO.0b013e31822461b0","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Systematic

We modelled importations in time based on air travel combined with incidence in Middle East.\n\n We used the detailed history of MERS case management after importation (time to hospitalization and

multiple countries around the world.\n\n In order to support risk assessment practice, the present study aimed to devise a novel statistical model to quantify the country-level risk of experiencing an importation of MERS case.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analyzed the arrival time of each reported MERS importation around the world, i.\n\ne.\n\n, the date on which imported cases entered a specific country, which was modeled as a dependent variable in our analysis.\n\n We also used openly accessible data including the airline transportation network to parameterize a hazard-based risk prediction model.\n\n The hazard was assumed to follow an inverse function of the effective distance (i.\n\ne.\n\n, the minimum effective length of a path from origin to destination), which was calculated from the airline transportation data, from Saudi Arabia to each country.\n\n Both country-specific religion and the incidence data of MERS in Saudi Arabia were used to improve our model prediction.\n\n\nResults\nOur estimates of the risk of MERS importation appeared to be right skewed, which facilitated the visual identification of countries at highest risk of MERS importations in the right tail of the distribution.\n\n The simplest model that relied solely on the effective distance yielded the best predictive performance (Area under the curve (AUC)?=?0.943) with 100 % sensitivity and 79.6 % specificity.\n\n Out of the 30 countries estimated to be at highest risk of MERS case importation, 17 countries (56.7 %) have already reported at least one importation of MERS.\n\n Although model fit measured by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was improved by including country-specific religion (i.\n\ne.\n\n Muslim majority country), the predictive performance as measured by AUC was not improved after accounting for this covariate.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur relatively simple statistical model based on the effective distance derived from the airline transportation network data was found to help predicting the risk of importing MERS at the country level.\n\n The successful application of the effective distance model to predict MERS importations, particularly when computationally intensive large-scale transmission models may not be immediately applicable could have been benefited from the particularly low transmissibility of the MERS

(0.0–8.6) and 28.6 (0.0–63.9) secondary cases among patients who visited multiple healthcare facilities and others.\n\n The time-dependent reproduction numbers declined substantially below the value

the need to limit the contacts in healthcare settings.\n\n Contact tracing efforts could assist early laboratory testing and diagnosis of suspected

Impaired NK cell function has been identified in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a disease of obstructive vascular remodeling in the lungs, as well as in multiple rodent models of disease.\n However, the precise contribution of NK cell impairment to the initiation and progression of PAH remains unknown.\n Here, we report the development of spontaneous pulmonary hypertension in two independent genetic models of NK cell dysfunction, including Nfil3?/? mice, which are deficient in NK cells due to the absence of the NFIL3 transcription factor, and Ncr1-Gfp mice, which lack the NK activating receptor NKp46. Mouse models of NK insufficiency exhibited increased right ventricular systolic pressure and muscularization of the pulmonary arteries in the absence of elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, indicating that the development of pulmonary hypertension was not secondary to left heart dysfunction.\n In cases of severe NK cell impairment or loss, a subset of mice failed to develop pulmonary hypertension and instead exhibited reduced systemic blood pressure, demonstrating an extension of vascular abnormalities beyond the pulmonary circulation into the systemic vasculature.\n In both mouse models, the development of PAH was linked to elevated interleukin-23 production, whereas systemic hypotension in Ncr1-Gfp mice was accompanied by a loss of angiopoietin-2. Together, these results support an important role for NK cells in the regulation of pulmonary and systemic vascular function and the pathogenesis of PAH.\n","id":"PMC6337009","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthew T.","surname":"Rätsep","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephen D.","surname":"Moore","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Stephen D.","surname":"Moore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salema","surname":"Jafri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Melissa","surname":"Mitchell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hugh J.

Accordingly, if natural Treg were depleted with specific anti-CD25 antibody before infection with HSV, the resultant CD8+ T cell response to the immunodominant peptide SSIEFARL was significantly enhanced.\n This was shown by several in vitro measures of CD8+ T cell reactivity and by assays that directly determine CD8+ T cell function, such as proliferation and cytotoxicity in vivo.\n The

progressive and still incurable disease.\n\n Research of IPAH-pathogenesis is complicated by the lack of a direct access to the involved tissue, the human pulmonary vasculature.\n\n Various auto-antibodies have been described in the blood of patients with IPAH.\n\n The purpose of the present work was therefore to comparatively analyze peripheral blood B lymphocyte RNA expression characteristics in IPAH and healthy controls.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients were diagnosed having IPAH according to WHO (mean pulmonary arterial pressure ? 25 mmHg, pulmonary capillary occlusion pressure ? 15 mmHg, absence of another explaining disease).\n\n Peripheral blood B-lymphocytes of patients and controls were immediately separated by density gradient centrifugation and magnetic beads for CD19. RNA was thereafter extracted and analyzed by the use of a high sensitivity gene chip (Affymetrix HG-U133-Plus2) able to analyze 47000 transcripts and variants of human genes.\n\n The array data were analyzed by two different softwares, and up-and down-regulations were defined as at least 1.3 fold with standard deviations smaller than fold-changes.\n\n\nResults\nHighly purified B-cells of 5 patients with IPAH (mean pulmonary artery pressure 51 ± 13 mmHg) and 5 controls were analyzed.\n\n Using the two different analyzing methods we found 225 respectively 128 transcripts which were up-regulated (1.3–30.7 fold) in IPAH compared with healthy controls.\n\n Combining both methods, there were 33 overlapping up-regulated transcripts and no down-regulated B-cell transcripts.\n\n\nConclusion\nPatients with IPAH have a distinct RNA expression profile of their peripheral blood B-lymphocytes compared to healthy controls with some clearly up-regulated genes.\n\n Our finding suggests that in IPAH patients B cells are activated.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2262076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Silvia","surname":"Ulrich","email":"ulris@bluewin.ch","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laima","surname":"Taraseviciene-Stewart","email":"laima.taraseviciene@uchsc.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lars C","surname":"Huber","email":"lars.huber@usz.ch","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rudolf","surname":"Speich","email":"rudolf.speich@usz.ch","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Norbert","surname":"Voelkel","email":"nvoelkel@mcvh-vcu.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1164/rccm.201105-0927OC","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pulmonary Lymphoid Neogenesis in Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1152/ajplung.00311.2016","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The mast cell-B cell axis in lung vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00519.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Differential release of mast cell mediators and the pathogenesis of inflammation","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1146/annurev.immunol.26.021607.090320","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Master Switch: The Role of Mast Cells in Autoimmunity and Tolerance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1164/ajrccm.151.5.7735624","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Increased interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 serum concentrations in severe primary pulmonary hypertension","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.933762","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Elevated Levels of Inflammatory Cytokines Predict Survival in Idiopathic and Familial Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.182014","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Interleukin-6 overexpression induces pulmonary hypertension","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1165/rcmb.2012-0077OC","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Induced by SU5416 and Ovalbumin Immunization","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.molimm.2004.06.025","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Altered B lymphocyte function induces systemic autoimmunity in systemic sclerosis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/01.bor.0000179945.73518.28","date":"1970-01-01","title":"B lymphocytes and systemic sclerosis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/2045893218757596","date":"2018-01-16","title":"Inflammation and autoimmunity in pulmonary hypertension: is there a role for endothelial adhesion molecules?

In this review, we will discuss the present evidence for an inflammatory component in PH disease with a specific focus on the potential role of the endothelium in this scenario and highlight future avenues of experimental investigation which may lead to novel therapeutic interventions.\n","id":"PMC5865459","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wolfgang M.","surname":"Kuebler","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sébastien","surname":"Bonnet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Arata","surname":"Tabuchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.978627","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Macrophage Recruitment and Alternative Activation Are Critical for the Later Development of Hypoxia-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1161/ATVBAHA.120.314639","date":"2020-10-20","title":"Altered Macrophage Polarization Induces Experimental Pulmonary Hypertension and Is Observed in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension","abstract":"Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text.\n","id":"PMC7752239","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Amira","surname":"Zawia","email":"a.a.zawia@sheffield.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nadine D.","surname":"Arnold","email":"n.d.arnold@sheffield.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"West","email":"l.west@sheffield.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Josephine A.","surname":"Pickworth","email":"j.a.pickworth@sheffield.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Helena","surname":"Turton","email":"helena.turton@sheffield.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James","surname":"Iremonger","email":"james.iremonger@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Adam T.","surname":"Braithwaite","email":"adam.braithwaite@cardiov.ox.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jaime","surname":"Cañedo","email":"jcanedo1@sheffield.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simon A.","surname":"Johnston","email":"s.a.johnston@sheffield.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.A.

transient flu-like symptoms to serious effects such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, renal and liver failure, polyneuropathy, and myelosuppression.\n Pulmonary side effects including pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and reversible pulmonary hypertension have been reported.\n Herein, we present four cases in which irreversible pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed after prolonged treatment with interferon alpha.\n In each case, other causes of pulmonary hypertension were systematically eliminated.\n Pulmonary artery hypertension, which may be irreversible, should be considered in patients being treated with interferon alpha who present with exertional dyspnea and do not have a readily identifiable inflammatory or thromboembolic

CD200 Expression on T CD4+ and T CD8+ Lymphocytes as a Non-Invasive Marker of Idiopathic Pulmonary Hypertension–Preliminary Study","abstract":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can develop subsequently to disorganized endothelial cell proliferation within the pulmonary arteriolar layers that provide mechanical limits to the pulmonary vascular bed.\n Although the actual factor triggering vascular endothelial proliferation remains unknown to date, genetic susceptibility, hypoxia, inflammation, as well as response to drugs and toxins have been proposed as possible contributors.\n Since inflammation contributes to vascular remodeling, the changed immune response is increasingly considered a plausible cause of this cardiovascular disease.\n The interaction of a membrane glycoprotein cluster of differentiation 200 (CD200) and its structurally similar receptor (CD200R) plays a crucial role in the modulation of the inflammatory response.\n Our previous studies have shown that the overexpression of the other negative co-stimulatory molecule (programmed death cell-PD-1) and its ligand-1 (PD-L1) is closely related to iPAH and the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation markers.\n Therefore, we considered it necessary to analyze the different types of PAH in terms of CD200 and CD200R expression and to correlate CD200/CD200R pathway expression with important clinical and laboratory parameters.\n The CD200/C200R-signaling pathway has not been subject to much research.\n We included 70 treatment-naïve, newly diagnosed patients with PAH in our study.\n They were further divided into subsets according to the pulmonary hypertension classification: chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) subset, pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease (CHD-PAH), pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease (CTD-PAH), and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH).\n The control group consisted of 20 healthy volunteers matched for sex and age.\n The highest percentages of T CD200+CD4+ and T CD200+CD8+ lymphocytes were observed in the group of patients with iPAH and this finding was associated with the presence of EBV DNA in the peripheral blood.\n Our assessment of the peripheral blood lymphocytes expression of CD200 and CD200R indicates that these molecules act as negative co-stimulators in the induction and persistence of PAH-associated inflammation, especially that of iPAH.\n Similar results imply that the dysregulation of the CD200/CD200R axis may be involved in the pathogenesis of several immune diseases.\n Our work suggests that CD200 and CD200R expression may serve to distinguish between PAH cases.\n Thus, CD200 and CD200R might be useful as markers in managing PAH and should be further investigated.\n","id":"PMC7957729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Micha?","surname":"Tomaszewski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ewelina","surname":"Grywalska","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weronika","surname":"Topy?a-Putowska","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Weronika","surname":"Topy?a-Putowska","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Piotr","surname":"B?aszczak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marcin","surname":"Kurzyna","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jacek","surname":"Roli?ski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jacek","surname":"Roli?ski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Grzegorz","surname":"Kope?","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Grzegorz","surname":"Kope?","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Takashi","surname":"Ohtsuka","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Takashi","surname":"Ohtsuka","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Takashi","surname":"Ohtsuka","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s11912-012-0284-2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Programmed

is expressed broadly on hematopoietic and parenchymal cells, including pancreatic islet cells; and PD-L2, which is restricted to macrophages and dendritic cells.\n To investigate whether PD-L1 and

self-reactive T cells in the pancreas.\n Our studies with bone marrow chimeras demonstrate that PD-L1/PD-L2 expression only on antigen-presenting cells is insufficient to prevent the early onset diabetes that develops in PD-L1/PD-L2?/? non-obese diabetic mice.\n PD-L1 expression in islets protects against immunopathology after transplantation of syngeneic islets into diabetic recipients.\n PD-L1 inhibits pathogenic self-reactive CD4+ T cell–mediated tissue destruction and effector cytokine production.\n These data provide evidence that PD-L1 expression on parenchymal cells rather than

was to determine how inflammation influences PD?1?mediated T cell suppression.\n Flow cytometry analysis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) synovial fluid (SF) mononuclear cells showed an increase in the percentage of PD?1+ cells within the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartment compared to paired peripheral blood (PB).\n Upon in?vitro T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation of healthy control (HC) CD4+ T cells in the presence of plate?bound PD?L1fc chimera, significantly decreased proliferation and interferon (IFN)?? secretion was observed.\n In contrast, CD4+ T cells from RA and PsA PB and SF appeared resistant to such PD?1?mediated inhibition.\n Addition of the proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF)?, interleukin (IL)?6 and IL?1?, which were increased in RA and PsA SF compared to osteoarthritis (OA) SF, consistently abrogated PD?1?mediated suppression in HC CD4+ T cell cultures.\n This effect was reversed by inhibitors of these cytokines.\n Soluble PD?1 (sPD?1) levels were increased in cell culture supernatants from TNF? and IL?6?stimulated cultures compared to untreated controls, and also in RA and PsA, but not in OA, serum and SF.\n Functionally, addition of sPD?1fc counteracted PD?1?mediated suppression of HC CD4+ T cells, and increased T cell proliferation in HC CD4+ T cell/monocyte co?cultures.\n These in?vitro findings indicate that CD4+ T cells from patients with RA and PsA show increased resistance to PD?1?mediated suppression, which may be explained in part by the presence of soluble PD?1 in the inflammatory

peptide, e.\ng.\n, in the setting of cardiovascular disease.\n Very recently, another branch of the RAS was discovered, based on angiotensin peptides in which the amino-terminal aspartate was replaced by alanine, the alatensins.\n Ala-ANG-(1?7) or alamandine was shown to interact with Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor D, and the first functional data indicated that this peptide also exerts protective effects in the cardiovascular system.\n This review summarizes the presentations given at the International Union of Physiological Sciences Congress in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2017, during the symposium entitled “The Renin-Angiotensin System: Going Beyond the Classical Paradigms,” in which the signaling and physiological actions of ANG-(1?7), ACE2, AT2R, and alatensins were reported (with a focus on noncentral nervous system-related tissues) and the therapeutic opportunities based on these findings were discussed.\n","id":"PMC7191626","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Robson Augusto

disability-adjusted life years, and years lived with disability for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015","abstract":"Background\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are common diseases with a heterogeneous distribution worldwide.\n\n Here, we present methods and disease and risk estimates for COPD and asthma from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 2015 study.\n\n The GBD study provides annual updates on estimates of deaths, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a summary measure of fatal and non-fatal disease outcomes, for over 300 diseases and injuries, for 188 countries from 1990 to the most recent year.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated numbers of deaths due to COPD and asthma using the GBD Cause of Death Ensemble modelling (CODEm) tool.\n\n First, we analysed data from vital registration and verbal autopsy for the aggregate category of all chronic respiratory diseases.\n\n Subsequently, models were run for asthma and COPD relying on covariates to predict rates in countries that have incomplete or no vital registration data.\n\n Disease estimates for COPD and asthma were based on systematic reviews of published papers, unpublished reports, surveys, and health service encounter data from the USA.\n\n We used the Global Initiative of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease spirometry-based definition as the reference for COPD and a reported diagnosis of asthma with current wheeze as the definition of asthma.\n\n We used a Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, to derive estimates of prevalence and incidence.\n\n We estimated population-attributable fractions for risk factors for COPD and asthma from exposure data, relative risks, and a theoretical minimum exposure level.\n\n Results were stratified by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure of income per capita, mean years of education over the age of 15 years, and total fertility rate.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2015, 3·2 million people (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1 million to 3·3 million) died from COPD worldwide, an increase of 11·6% (95% UI 5·3 to 19·8) compared with 1990. There was a decrease in age-standardised death rate of 41·9% (37·7 to 45·1) but this was counteracted by population growth and ageing of the global population.\n\n From 1990 to 2015, the prevalence of COPD increased by 44·2% (41·7 to 46·6), whereas age-standardised prevalence decreased by 14·7% (13·5 to 15·9).\n\n In 2015, 0·40 million people (0·36 million to 0·44 million) died from asthma, a decrease of 26·7% (?7·2 to 43·7) from 1990, and the age-standardised death rate decreased by 58·8% (39·0 to 69·0).\n\n The prevalence of asthma increased by 12·6% (9·0 to 16·4), whereas the age-standardised prevalence decreased by 17·7% (15·1 to 19·9).\n\n Age-standardised DALY rates due to COPD increased until the middle range of the SDI before reducing sharply.\n\n Age-standardised DALY rates due to asthma in both sexes decreased monotonically with rising SDI.\n\n The relation between with SDI and DALY rates due to asthma was attributed to variation in years of life lost (YLLs), whereas DALY rates due to COPD varied similarly for YLLs and years lived with disability across the SDI continuum.\n\n Smoking and ambient particulate matter were the main risk factors for COPD followed by household air pollution, occupational particulates, ozone, and secondhand smoke.\n\n Together, these risks explained 73·3% (95% UI 65·8 to 80·1) of DALYs due to COPD.\n\n Smoking and occupational asthmagens were the only risks quantified for asthma in GBD, accounting for 16·5% (14·6 to 18·7) of DALYs due to asthma.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAsthma was the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide in 2015, with twice the number of cases of COPD.\n\n Deaths from COPD were eight times more common than deaths from asthma.\n\n In 2015, COPD caused 2·6% of global DALYs and asthma 1·1% of global DALYs.\n\n Although there are laudable international collaborative efforts to make surveys of asthma and COPD more comparable, no consensus exists on case definitions and how to measure disease severity for population health measurements like GBD.\n\n Comparisons between countries and over time are important, as much of the chronic respiratory burden is either preventable or treatable with affordable interventions.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5573769","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joan

groups such as patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are poorly understood.\n\n Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are widely used in COPD, but the extent to which these therapies protect or expose patients to risk of severe COVID-19 is unknown.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ICSs following pulmonary expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2).\n\n\nMethods\nWe evaluated the effect of ICS administration on pulmonary ACE2 expression in vitro in human airway epithelial cell cultures and in vivo in mouse models of ICS administration.\n\n Mice deficient in the type I IFN-?/? receptor (Ifnar1?/?) and administration of exogenous IFN-? were used to study the functional role of type-I interferon signaling in ACE2 expression.\n\n We compared sputum ACE2 expression in patients with COPD stratified according to use or nonuse of ICS.\n\n\nResults\nICS administration attenuated ACE2 expression in mice, an effect that was reversed by exogenous IFN-? administration, and Ifnar1?/? mice had reduced ACE2 expression, indicating that type I interferon contributes mechanistically to this effect.\n\n ICS administration attenuated expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cell cultures from patients with COPD and in mice with elastase-induced COPD-like changes.\n\n Compared with ICS nonusers, patients with COPD who were taking ICSs also had reduced sputum expression of ACE2.\n\n\nConclusion\nICS therapies in COPD reduce expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2. This effect may thus contribute to altered susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with COPD.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7558236","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lydia

lived with disability for 328 diseases and injuries for 195 countries, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016","abstract":"Background\nAs mortality rates decline, life expectancy increases, and populations age, non-fatal outcomes of diseases and injuries are becoming a larger component of the global burden of disease.\n\n The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016.\nMethods\nWe estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences.\n\n We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition.\n\n For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data.\n\n YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level.\n\n We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate.\n\n GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).\n\n\nFindings\nGlobally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57·6 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 40·8–75·9 million [7·2%, 6·0–8·3]), 45·1 million (29·0–62·8 million [5·6%, 4·0–7·2]), 36·3 million (25·3–50·9 million [4·5%, 3·8–5·3]), 34·7 million (23·0–49·6 million [4·3%, 3·5–5·2]), and 34·1 million (23·5–46·0 million [4·2%, 3·2–5·3]) of total YLDs, respectively.\n\n Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2·7% (95% UI 2·3–3·1).\n\n Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations.\n\n The largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years.\n\n Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined were 10·4% (95% UI 9·0–11·8) higher in women than in men.\n\n Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women.\n\n Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence.\n\n Globally, we noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality.\n\n In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100?000, 95% UI 6862–11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14?774 YLDs per 100?000, 11?018–19?228).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates.\n\n For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, such as diabetes.\n\n As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults.\n\n Up-to-date information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate health-system response.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of

risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease.\n\n It has been suggested that asthma and allergy are not highly represented as comorbid conditions associated with COVID-19.\nObjective\nOur aim was to extend our work in IL-13 biology to determine whether airway epithelial cell expression of 2 key mediators critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, namely, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), are modulated by IL-13.\nMethods\nWe determined effects of IL-13 treatment on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in primary airway epithelial cells from participants with and without type 2 asthma obtained by bronchoscopy.\n\n We also examined expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in 2 data sets containing gene expression data from nasal and airway epithelial cells from children and adults with asthma and allergic rhinitis.\n\n\nResults\nIL-13 significantly reduced ACE2 and increased TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in airway epithelial cells.\n\n In 2 independent data sets, ACE2 expression was significantly reduced and TMPRSS2 expression was significantly increased in the nasal and airway epithelial cells in type 2 asthma and allergic rhinitis.\n\n ACE2 expression was significantly negatively associated with type 2 cytokines, whereas TMPRSS2 expression was significantly positively associated with type 2 cytokines.\n\n\nConclusion\nIL-13 modulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in airway epithelial cells in asthma and atopy.\n\n This deserves further study with regard to any effects that asthma and atopy may render in the setting of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7227558","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hiroki","surname":"Kimura","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dave","surname":"Francisco","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"Conway","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fernando

and Laboratory Features of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Vis-À-Vis Onset of Fever","abstract":"Study objectives:\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a rapidly progressive disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) infection.\n\n However, the disease presentation is nonspecific.\n\n The aim of this study was to define clearly the presentation, clinical progression, and laboratory data in a group of patients who had SARS.\n\n\nDesign:\nRetrospective observational study.\n\n\nSetting:\nA tertiary care medical center with 51 negative-pressure isolation rooms in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\n\nPatients:\nFifty-three patients with SARS seen between April 27 and June 16, 2003.\nResults:\nFever (ie, temperature &gt; 38°C) was the most common symptom (98%) and the earliest.\n\n When admitted to the isolation unit of the hospital for observation, most patients reported nonspecific symptoms associated with their fever.\n\n Only two patients with preexisting illnesses had cough on the same day the fever began.\n\n Eventually, 39 patients (74%) developed cough, beginning at a mean (± SD) time of 4.5 ± 1.9 days after fever onset, and 35 patients (66%) had diarrhea beginning at a mean time of 6.0 ± 3.3 days after fever onset.\n\n Thirty-one patients (59%) had abnormal findings on chest radiographs on hospital admission, and all but 1 patient (98%) eventually developed lung infiltrates that were consistent with pneumonia.\n\n The majority of patients (63%) first developed unifocal infiltrates at a mean time of 4.5 ± 2.1 days after fever onset, while in 37% of patients the initial infiltrates were multifocal, appearing at a mean time of 5.8 ± 1.3 days after fever onset.\n\n Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia (on hospital admission, 70%; during hospitalization, 95%), thrombocytopenia (on hospital admission, 28%; during hospitalization, 40%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (on hospital admission, 58%; during hospitalization, 88%), creatine kinase (on hospital admission, 18%; during hospitalization, 32%), and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels (on hospital admission, 27%; during hospitalization, 62%).\n\n Throat or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR was positive in 40 of the 47 patients (85%) in whom the test was performed.\n\n\nConclusions:\nNone of the presenting symptoms or laboratory findings are pathognomonic for SARS.\n\n Even though cough developed in a majority of patients, it did not occur until later in the disease course, suggesting that a cough preceding or concurrent with the onset of fever is less likely to indicate SARS.\n\n While PCR for SARS-CoV appears to be the best early diagnostic test currently available, it is clear that better methods are needed to differentiate between SARS and non-SARS illness on initial presentation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094461","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ching-Lung","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yen-Ta","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meng-Jen","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pei-Jan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rong-Luh","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chien-Liang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hsu-Tah","surname":"Kuo","email":"kuohsu@ms2.mmh.org.tw","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/cid/cis733","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Population-based
