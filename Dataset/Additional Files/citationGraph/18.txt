SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 are limited.\n\n\nObjective\nWe sought to evaluate the severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020, to February 5, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model.\n\n Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission.\n\n Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-?), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission.\n\n The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan.\n\n The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period.\n\n Survival analysis revealed that male sex, older age, leukocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19.\nConclusions\nPatients with older age, hypertension, and high lactate dehydrogenase level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19.

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

Various agents were initially proclaimed to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are all examples of therapeutic agents, whose efficacy against COVID-19 was later disproved.\n Meanwhile, concentrated efforts of researchers and clinicians worldwide have led to the identification of novel therapeutic options to control the disease including PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332).\n Although COVID-19 cases are currently treated using a comprehensive approach of anticoagulants, oxygen, and antibiotics, the novel Pfizer agent PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332), an investigational COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate, significantly reduced hospitalization time and death rates, based on an interim analysis of the phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness.\n The scheduled interim analysis demonstrated an 89 % reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint).\n However, there still exists a great need for the development of additional treatments, as the recommended therapeutic options are insufficient in many cases.\n Thus far, mRNA and vector vaccines appear to be the most effective modalities to control the pandemic.\n In the current review, we provide an update on the progress that has been made since April 2020 in clinical trials concerning the effectiveness of therapies available to combat COVID-19. We focus on currently recommended therapeutic agents, including steroids, various monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, baricitinib, anticoagulants and PAXLOVID™ summarizing the latest original studies and meta-analyses.\n Moreover, we aim to discuss other currently and previously studied agents targeting COVID-19 that either show no or only limited therapeutic activity.\n The results of recent studies report that hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma demonstrate no efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Lastly, we summarize the studies on various drugs with incoherent or insufficient data concerning their effectiveness, such as amantadine, ivermectin, or niclosamide.\n","id":"PMC8654464","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sylwester","surname":"Dro?d?al","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jakub","surname":"Rosik","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kacper","surname":"Lechowicz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Filip","surname":"Machaj","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bartosz","surname":"Szostak","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jaros?aw","surname":"Przybyci?ski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shahrokh","surname":"Lorzadeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katarzyna","surname":"Kotfis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saeid","surname":"Ghavami","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marek

(RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","abstract":"Background\nCasirivimab and imdevimab are non-competing monoclonal antibodies that bind to two different sites on the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, blocking viral entry into host cells.\n\n We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of casirivimab and imdevimab administered in combination in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nRECOVERY is a randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial comparing several possible treatments with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 127 UK hospitals took part in the evaluation of casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n Eligible participants were any patients aged at least 12 years admitted to hospital with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone or usual care plus casirivimab 4 g and imdevimab 4 g administered together in a single intravenous infusion.\n\n Investigators and data assessors were masked to analyses of the outcome data during the trial.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality assessed by intention to treat, first only in patients without detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection at randomisation (ie, those who were seronegative) and then in the overall population.\n\n Safety was assessed in all participants who received casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov (NCT04381936).\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Sept 18, 2020, and May 22, 2021, 9785 patients enrolled in RECOVERY were eligible for casirivimab and imdevimab, of which 4839 were randomly assigned to casirivimab and imdevimab plus usual care and 4946 to usual care alone.\n\n 3153 (32%) of 9785 patients were seronegative, 5272 (54%) were seropositive, and 1360 (14%) had unknown baseline antibody status.\n\n 812 (8%) patients were known to have received at least one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\n In the primary efficacy population of seronegative patients, 396 (24%) of 1633 patients allocated to casirivimab and imdevimab versus 452 (30%) of 1520 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 0·79, 95% CI 0·69–0·91; p=0·0009).\n\n In an analysis of all randomly assigned patients (regardless of baseline antibody status), 943 (19%) of 4839 patients allocated to casirivimab and imdevimab versus 1029 (21%) of 4946 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (RR 0·94, 95% CI 0·86–1·02; p=0·14).\n\n The proportional effect of casirivimab and imdevimab on mortality differed significantly between seropositive and seronegative patients (p value for heterogeneity=0·002).\n\n There were no deaths attributed to the treatment, or meaningful between-group differences in the pre-specified safety outcomes of cause-specific mortality, cardiac arrhythmia, thrombosis, or major bleeding events.\n\n Serious adverse reactions reported in seven (&lt;1%) participants were believed by the local investigator to be related to treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, the monoclonal antibody combination of casirivimab and imdevimab reduced 28-day mortality in patients who were seronegative (and therefore had not mounted their own humoral immune response) at baseline but not in those who were seropositive at baseline.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Research and Innovation

antibodies","abstract":"id='Par1'>The SARS-CoV-2 B.\n1.1.529 (Omicron) variant contains 15 mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD).\n How Omicron evades RBD-targeted neutralizing antibodies requires immediate investigation.\n Here we use high-throughput yeast display screening1,2 to determine the profiles of RBD escaping mutations for 247 human anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies and show that the neutralizing antibodies can be classified by unsupervised clustering into six epitope groups (A–F)—a grouping that is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications3–5.\n Various single mutations of Omicron can impair neutralizing antibodies of different epitope groups.\n Specifically, neutralizing antibodies in groups A–D, the epitopes of which overlap with the ACE2-binding motif, are largely escaped by K417N, G446S, E484A and Q493R.\n Antibodies in group E (for example, S309)6 and group F (for example, CR3022)7, which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but a subset of neutralizing antibodies are still escaped by G339D, N440K and S371L.\n Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could also be escaped, owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes.\n In total, over 85% of the tested neutralizing antibodies were escaped by Omicron.\n With regard to neutralizing-antibody-based drugs, the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10933, REGN10987, AZD1061, AZD8895 and BRII-196 was greatly undermined by Omicron, whereas VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still functioned at a reduced efficacy.\n Together, our data suggest that infection with Omicron would result in considerable humoral immune evasion, and that neutralizing antibodies targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region will remain most effective.\n Our results inform the development of antibody-based drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants.\n","id":"PMC8866119","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yunlong","surname":"Cao","email":"yunlongcao@pku.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fanchong","surname":"Jian","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Fanchong","surname":"Jian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiliang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ayijiang","surname":"Yisimayi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weijin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qianqian","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Qianqian","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ran","surname":"An","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiao","surname":"Niu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sijie","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haiyan","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuanling","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qianqian","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaodong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuo","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhiying","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhiying","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaohua","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xiaohua","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ronghua","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiangxi","surname":"Wang","email":"xiangxi@ibp.ac.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junyu","surname":"Xiao","email":"junyuxiao@pku.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Youchun","surname":"Wang","email":"wangyc@nifdc.org.cn","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Youchun","surname":"Wang","email":"wangyc@nifdc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoliang

to facilitate its infection.\n Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification.\n Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment.\n Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice.\n Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient.\n Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab.\n Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis.\n Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.","id":"PMC7714896","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Yongqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jian-Qi","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ding","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Xuan","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhiwei","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jie-Jie","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Jie-Jie","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruo","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Hai","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yu-Meng","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Nan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jian-Li","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jiao","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Wan","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liangzhi","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Hui","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Jin-Lin","surname":"Miao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Hong-Yong","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiang-Min","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhongpeng","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shihui","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongjing","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhe","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Chun-Fu","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yacheng","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ying-Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing-Yi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Huijie","surname":"Bian","email":"hjbian@fmmu.edu.cn","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Zhu","email":"zhuping@fmmu.edu.cn","contributions":"6"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Nan","surname":"Chen","email":"znchen@fmmu.edu.cn","contributions":"4"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s13578-022-00822-6","date":"2022-05-27","title":"Development of a novel human CD147 knock-in NSG mouse model to test SARS-CoV-2 viral infection","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>An animal model that can mimic the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is critical to understanding the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and for development of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat emerging mutants.\n\n Studies show that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry.\n\n Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which are clearly invaluable.\n\n However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: (1) low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients; (2) low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients; and (3) hACE2Tg mice do not mimic the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.\n\n Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronavirus infection is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a possible co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry.\n\n It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par2'>Here we successfully generated a hCD147 knock-in mouse model (hCD147KI) in the NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG) background.\n\n In this hCD147KI-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed downstream of the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of hCD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 (JAX) model.\n\n In addition, the hCD147KI-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations in immunosuppressed states.\n\n Our data show (1) the human CD147 protein is expressed in various organs (including bronchiolar epithelial cells) in hCD147KI-NSG mice by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry; (2) hCD147KI-NSG mice are marginally sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to WT-NSG littermates characterized by increased viral copies by qRT-PCR and moderate body weight decline compared to baseline; (3) a significant increase in leukocytes in the lungs of hCD147KI-NSG mice, compared to infected WT-NSG mice.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par3'>hCD147KI-NSG mice are more sensitive to COVID-19 infection compared to WT-NSG mice.\n\n The hCD147KI-NSG mouse model can serve as an additional animal model for further interrogation whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at

humanized CD147 transgenic mice were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and its two variants, alpha and beta.\n When infected, these mice developed exudative alveolar pneumonia, featured by immune responses involving alveoli-infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes and activation of IL-17 signaling pathway.\n Mechanistically, we proposed that severe COVID-19-related cytokine storm is induced by a “spike protein-CD147-CyPA signaling axis”: Infection of SARS-CoV-2 through CD147 initiated the JAK-STAT pathway, which further induced expression of cyclophilin A (CyPA); CyPA reciprocally bound to CD147 and triggered MAPK pathway.\n Consequently, the MAPK pathway regulated the expression of cytokines and chemokines, which promoted the development of cytokine storm.\n Importantly, Meplazumab

symptomatic and for activating public health measures.\n Antigen rapid detection tests detect viral proteins and, although they are less sensitive than molecular tests, have the advantages of being easier to do, giving a faster time to result, of being lower cost, and able to detect infection in those who are most likely to be at risk of transmitting the virus to others.\n Antigen rapid detection tests can be used as a public health tool for screening individuals at enhanced risk of infection, to protect people who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure safe travel and the resumption of schooling and social activities, and to enable economic recovery.\n With vaccine roll-out, antibody tests (which detect the host's response to infection or vaccination) can be useful surveillance tools to inform public policy, but should not be used to provide proof of immunity, as the correlates of protection remain unclear.\n All three types of COVID-19 test continue to have a crucial role

17-year-old male with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) secondary to COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nCase report\nThis patient presented with cough, sore throat, anorexia and pyrexia.\n\n On examination, he had gross cervical lymphadenopathy and palpable splenomegaly.\n\n Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels.\n\n The patient's H-Score [2] was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 93–96%.\n\n Considering Russell and colleagues' [3] comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with COVID-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\n\nResults\nThe patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24?h.\n\n His lymph nodes and spleen began to normalise after the first 48?h, at which time point the ferritin also started to decrease.\n\n He was discharged after 11?days feeling fit and well.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis case certainly illustrates the importance of hyperinflammation syndromes in COVID-19. It also raises the question – is the severe pneumonitis seen in patients with COVID-19 an immunological phenomenon? We know that the viral load of patients with COVID-19 seems to peak in the early stages of illness [4,5]; however, patients deteriorate later in the disease course, at around days 10–14. This patient, who had risk factors for deterioration (male, pancytopaenic), did not develop an oxygen requirement and clinically and biochemically improved rapidly on Anakinra with no adverse events.\n\n We might suggest Anakinra to the scientific community as a treatment option in COVID-19 infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7245680","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kathryn","surname":"Haigh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zoe Joanna","surname":"Syrimi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sharon","surname":"Irvine","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tom J.","surname":"Blanchard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Muhammad Sajid","surname":"Pervaiz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Arpad G.","surname":"Toth","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Libuse","surname":"Ratcliffe","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.18632/aging.103579","date":"2020-06-12","title":"Epidemiological, comorbidity factors with severity and prognosis of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in an attempt to systematically collect and evaluate the associations of epidemiological, comorbidity factors with the severity and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n The systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the guidelines proposed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).\n Sixty nine publications met our study criteria, and 61 studies with more than 10,000 COVID-19 cases were eligible for the quantitative synthesis.\n We found that the males had significantly higher disease severity (RR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.13-1.27, P &lt;0.001) and more prognostic endpoints.\n Older age was found to be significantly associated with the disease severity and six prognostic endpoints.\n Chronic kidney disease contributed mostly for death (RR: 7.10, 95% CI: 3.14-16.02), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for disease severity (RR: 4.20, 95% CI: 2.82-6.25), admission to intensive care unit (ICU) (RR: 5.61, 95% CI: 2.68-11.76), the composite endpoint (RR: 8.52, 95% CI: 4.36-16.65,), invasive ventilation (RR: 6.53, 95% CI: 2.70-15.84), and disease progression (RR: 7.48, 95% CI: 1.60-35.05), cerebrovascular disease for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (RR: 3.15, 95% CI: 1.23-8.04), coronary heart disease for cardiac abnormality (RR: 5.37, 95% CI: 1.74-16.54).\n Our study highlighted that the male gender, older age and comorbidities owned strong epidemiological evidence of associations with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.","id":"PMC7377860","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaoyu","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hao","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Penghao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yao","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liqing","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wenbin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Jia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiangyu","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00134-018-5332-4","date":"2018-07-21","title":"Corticosteroid treatment in critically ill patients with severe influenza pneumonia: a propensity score matching study","abstract":"Purpose\nid='Par1'>To determine clinical predictors associated with corticosteroid administration and its association with ICU mortality in critically ill patients with severe influenza pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients with confirmed influenza pneumonia admitted to 148 ICUs in Spain between June 2009 and April 2014.

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lanying","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David M.","surname":"Ojcius","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chungen","surname":"Pan","email":"chungenp@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shibo","surname":"Jiang","email":"shibojiang@fudan.edu.cn","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.1164/rccm.2014P7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel Wuhan (2019-nCoV) coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.78.15.7863-7866.2004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus phylogeny: toward consensus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia (trial version 7) [J / OL].

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21.

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaolin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xingwang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuelei","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangfa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongmeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Wang","email":"wangjw28@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"caobin_ben@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

positive pressure ventilation is a sound treatment for SARS patients with respiratory failure if administered with due precaution in the correct environment.\n Interferons and other novel agents may

countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected

limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes

retrospective cohort of 78 consecutive adult SARS patients admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong between March and May 2003 was analysed to study the effectiveness of corticosteroid.\n\n They were categorized according to whether or not corticosteroid therapy was given, and compared in terms of demographic characteristics, comorbidities, peak lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and clinical

SARS coronavirus","abstract":"Background\nThe complex interplay between viral replication and host immune response during infection remains poorly understood.\n\n While many viruses are known to employ anti-immune strategies to facilitate their replication, highly pathogenic virus infections can also cause an excessive immune response that exacerbates, rather than reduces pathogenicity.\n\n To investigate this dichotomy in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we developed a transcriptional network model of SARS-CoV infection in mice and used the model to prioritize candidate regulatory targets for further investigation.\n\n\nResults\nWe validated our predictions in 18 different knockout (KO) mouse strains, showing that network topology provides significant predictive power to identify genes that are important for viral infection.\n\n We identified a novel player in the immune response to virus infection, Kepi, an inhibitory subunit of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, which protects against SARS-CoV pathogenesis.\n\n We also found that receptors for the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF?) promote pathogenesis, presumably through excessive inflammation.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe current study provides validation of network modeling approaches for identifying important players in virus infection pathogenesis, and a step forward in understanding the host response to an important infectious disease.\n\n The results presented here suggest the role of Kepi in the host response to SARS-CoV, as well as inflammatory activity driving pathogenesis through TNF? signaling in SARS-CoV infections.\n\n Though we have reported the utility of this approach in bacterial and cell culture studies previously, this is the first comprehensive study to confirm that network topology can be used to predict phenotypes in mice with experimental validation.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this

Report","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage.\n\n Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care.\n\n Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P&lt;0.001).\n\n The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization.\n\n In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs.\n\n 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs.\n\n 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs.\n\n 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.\n\n

Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate Weibull regression models were used to assess incidence, microbial cause, resistance patterns, risk factors (ie, demographics, comorbidities, exposure to medication), and impact on outcomes (ie, ICU discharge, length of ICU and hospital stays, and duration of mechanical ventilation) of microbiologically confirmed HAIs.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 774 included patients, 359 patients (46%) demonstrated 759 HAIs (44.7 infections/1,000 ICU patient-days; 35% multidrug-resistant [MDR] bacteria).\n\n Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP; n = 389 [50%]), bloodstream infections (BSIs; n = 183 [34%]), and catheter-related BSIs (n = 74 [10%]) were the most frequent HAIs, with 26.0 (95% CI, 23.6-28.8) VAPs per 1,000 intubation-days, 11.7 (95% CI, 10.1-13.5) BSIs per 1,000 ICU patient-days, and 4.7 (95% CI, 3.8-5.9) catheter-related BSIs per 1,000 ICU patient-days.\n\n Gram-negative bacteria (especially Enterobacterales) and Staphylococcus aureus caused 64% and 28% of cases of VAP, respectively.\n\n Variables independently associated with infection were age, positive end expiratory pressure, and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics at admission.\n\n Two hundred thirty-four patients (30%) died in the ICU (15.3 deaths/1,000 ICU patient-days).\n\n Patients with HAIs complicated by septic shock showed an almost doubled mortality rate (52% vs 29%), whereas noncomplicated infections did not affect mortality.\n\n HAIs prolonged mechanical ventilation (median, 24 days [interquartile range (IQR), 14-39 days] vs 9 days [IQR, 5-13 days]; P &lt; .\n\n001), ICU stay (24 days [IQR, 16-41 days] vs 9 days [IQR, 6-14 days]; P = .\n\n003), and hospital stay (42 days [IQR, 25-59 days] vs 23 days [IQR, 13-34 days]; P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nCritically ill patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for HAIs, especially VAPs and BSIs resulting from MDR organisms.\n\n HAIs prolong mechanical ventilation and

synthesis is necessary for DNA replication and for RNA production to support protein synthesis at different stages of the cell cycle, during which these events are regulated at multiple levels.\n Therefore the synthesis of the precursor nucleotides is also strongly regulated at multiple levels.\n Nucleotide synthesis is an energy intensive process that uses multiple metabolic pathways across different cell compartments and several sources of carbon and nitrogen.\n The processes are regulated at the transcription level by a set of master transcription factors but also at the enzyme level by allosteric regulation and feedback inhibition.\n Here we review the cellular demands of nucleotide biosynthesis, their metabolic pathways and mechanisms of regulation during the cell cycle.\n The use of stable isotope tracers for delineating the biosynthetic routes of the multiple intersecting pathways and how these are quantitatively controlled under different conditions is also highlighted.\n Moreover, the importance of nucleotide synthesis for cell viability is discussed and how this may lead to potential new approaches to drug development in diseases such as cancer.\n","id":"PMC4344498","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Andrew

causes neurological disorders during fetal development and in adulthood, antiviral drugs are necessary.\n Sofosbuvir is clinically approved for use against HCV and targets the protein that is most conserved among the members of the Flaviviridae family, the viral RNA polymerase.\n Indeed, we found that sofosbuvir inhibits ZIKV RNA polymerase, targeting conserved amino acid residues.\n Sofosbuvir inhibited ZIKV replication in different cellular systems, such as hepatoma (Huh-7) cells, neuroblastoma (SH-Sy5y) cells, neural stem cells (NSC) and brain organoids.\n In addition to the direct inhibition of the viral RNA polymerase, we observed that sofosbuvir also induced an increase in A-to-G mutations in the viral genome.\n Together, our data highlight a potential secondary use of

hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in humans, including liver damage.\n\n We aimed at characterizing the liver pathology in CCHF virus-infected IFNAR?/? mice by immunohistochemistry and employed the model to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 against CCHF virus.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nCCHF virus-infected IFNAR?/? mice died 2–6 days post infection with elevated aminotransferase levels and high virus titers in blood and organs.\n\n Main pathological alteration was acute hepatitis with extensive bridging necrosis, reactive hepatocyte proliferation, and mild to moderate inflammatory response with monocyte/macrophage activation.\n\n Virus-infected and apoptotic hepatocytes clustered in the necrotic areas.\n\n Ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 suppressed virus replication in vitro by ?3 log units (IC50 0.6–2.8 µg/ml; IC90 1.2–4.7 µg/ml).\n\n Ribavirin [100 mg/(kg×d)] did not increase the survival rate of IFNAR?/? mice, but prolonged the time to death (p&lt;0.001) and reduced the aminotransferase levels and the virus titers.\n\n Arbidol [150 mg/(kg×d)] had no efficacy in vivo.\n\n Animals treated with T-705 at 1 h [15, 30, and 300 mg/(kg×d)] or up to 2 days [300 mg/(kg×d)] post infection survived, showed no signs of disease, and had no virus in blood and organs.\n\n Co-administration of ribavirin and T-705 yielded beneficial rather than adverse effects.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nActivated hepatic macrophages and monocyte-derived cells may play a role in the proinflammatory cytokine response in CCHF.\n\n Clustering of infected hepatocytes in necrotic areas without marked inflammation suggests viral cytopathic effects.\n\n T-705 is highly potent against CCHF virus in vitro and in vivo.\n\n Its in vivo efficacy exceeds that of the current standard drug for treatment of CCHF, ribavirin.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4006714","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lisa","surname":"Oestereich","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Toni","surname":"Rieger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Melanie","surname":"Neumann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Bernreuther","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Lehmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susanne","surname":"Krasemann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephanie","surname":"Wurr","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Petra","surname":"Emmerich","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"de

65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients).\n\n In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose &lt; 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization ( 2C ); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D).\n\n\nConclusion\nThere was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis.\n\n Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2249616","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"R.

Patients With Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nIn hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, progression to acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\n\n Severe dysregulated systemic inflammation is the putative mechanism.\n\n We hypothesize that early prolonged methylprednisolone (MP) treatment could accelerate disease resolution, decreasing the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a multicenter observational study to explore the association between exposure to prolonged, low-dose MP treatment and need for ICU referral, intubation, or death within 28 days (composite primary end point) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Italian respiratory high-dependency units.\n\n Secondary outcomes were invasive MV-free days and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.\n\n\nResults\nFindings are reported as MP (n?=?83) vs control (n?=?90).\n\n The composite primary end point was met by 19 vs 40 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24–0.72).\n\n Transfer to ICU and invasive MV were necessary in 15 vs 27 (P?=?.\n\n07) and 14 vs 26 (P?=?.\n\n10), respectively.\n\n By day 28, the MP group had fewer deaths (6 vs 21; aHR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12–0.73) and more days off invasive MV (24.0?±?9.0 vs 17.5?±?12.8; P?=?.\n\n001).\n\n Study treatment was associated with rapid improvement in PaO2:FiO2 and CRP levels.\n\n The complication rate was similar for the 2 groups (P?=?.\n\n84).\n\n\nConclusion\nIn patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early administration of prolonged, low dose MP treatment was associated with a significantly lower hazard of death (71%) and decreased ventilator dependence.\n\n Treatment was safe and did not impact viral clearance.\n\n A large randomized controlled trial (RECOVERY trial) has been performed that validates these findings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7543560","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Francesco","surname":"Salton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paola","surname":"Confalonieri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"G

in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection.\n\n The median age was 58 years and 235 were male.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia.\n\n Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.\n\n Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines.\n\n The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases.\n\n Both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, and lower level of helper T cells in severe group.\n\n The percentage of naïve helper T cells increased and memory helper T cells decreased in severe

that during chronic inflammatory systemic diseases (CIDs) maladaptations of the immune, nervous, endocrine and reproductive system occur.\n Maladaptation leads to disease sequelae in CIDs.\n The ultimate reason of disease sequelae in CIDs remained unclear because clinicians do not consider bodily energy trade-offs and evolutionary medicine.\n We review the evolution of physiological supersystems, fitness consequences of genes involved in CIDs during different life-history stages, environmental factors of CIDs, energy trade-offs during inflammatory episodes and the non-specificity of CIDs.\n Incorporating bodily energy regulation into evolutionary medicine builds a framework to better understand pathophysiology of CIDs by considering that genes and networks used are positively selected if they serve acute, highly energy-consuming inflammation.\n It is predicted that genes that protect energy stores are positively selected (as immune memory).\n This could explain why energy-demanding inflammatory episodes like infectious diseases must be terminated within 3–8 weeks to be adaptive, and otherwise become maladaptive.\n Considering energy regulation as an evolved adaptive trait explains why many known sequelae of different CIDs must be uniform.\n These are, e.\ng.\n sickness behavior/fatigue/depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, anorexia, malnutrition, muscle wasting—cachexia, cachectic obesity, insulin resistance with hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, alterations of steroid hormone axes, disturbances of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, hypertension, bone loss and hypercoagulability.\n Considering evolved energy trade-offs helps us to understand how an energy imbalance can lead to the disease sequelae of CIDs.\n In the future, clinicians must translate this knowledge into early diagnosis and symptomatic treatment in CIDs.\n","id":"PMC4753361","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rainer

The “Persistent Inflammation, Immunosuppression, and Catabolism Syndrome” (PICS) has been postulated as the underlying pathophysiology of CCI.\n We propose that PICS is initiated by an early genomic and cytokine storm in response to microbial invasion during the early phase of sepsis.\n However, once source control, antimicrobial coverage, and supportive therapies have been initiated, we propose that the persistent inflammation in patients developing CCI is a result of ongoing endogenous alarmin release from damaged organs and loss of muscle mass.\n This ongoing alarmin and danger-associated molecular pattern signaling causes chronic inflammation and a shift in bone marrow stem cell production toward myeloid cells, contributing to chronic anemia and lymphopenia.\n We propose that therapeutic interventions must target the chronic organ injury and lean tissue wasting that contribute to the release of endogenous alarmins and the expansion and deposition of myeloid progenitors that are responsible for the propagation and persistence of CCI.\n","id":"PMC6036179","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Russell

associated with functional decline.\n\n Little is know about the relationship between inflammatory markers and determinants of functional status in this population.\n\n The aim of the study is to investigate the association between tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?, C-reactive protein (CRP) and Activities of Daily Living, and to identify risk factors associated with one year mortality or hospital readmission.\n\n\nMethods\n301 consecutive patients hospitalized for CAP (mean age 73.9 ± 5.3 years) in a University affiliated hospital over 18 month period were included.\n\n All patients were evaluated on admission to identify baseline demographic, microbiological, cognitive and functional characteristics.\n\n Serum levels for TNF-? and CRP were collected at the same time.\n\n Reassessment of functional status at discharge, and monthly thereafter till 3 months post discharge was obtained and compared with preadmission level to document loss or recovery of functionality.\n\n Outcome was assessed by the composite endpoint of hospital readmission or death from any cause up to one year post hospital discharge.\n\n\nResults\n36% of patients developed functional decline at discharge and 11% had persistent functional impairment at 3 months.\n\n Serum TNF-? (odds ratio [OR] 1.12, 95% CI 1.08–1.15; p &lt; 0.001) and the Charlson Index (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.71; p = 0.001) but not age, CRP, or cognitive status were independently associated with loss of functionality at the time of hospital discharge.\n\n Lack of recovery in functional status at 3 months was associated with impaired cognitive ability and preadmission comorbidities.\n\n In Cox regression analysis, persistent functional impairment at 3 months, impaired cognitive function, and the Charlson Index were highly predictive of one year hospital readmission or death.\n\n\nConclusion\nSerum TNF-? levels can be useful in determining patients at risk for functional impairment following hospitalization from CAP.\n\n Old patients with impaired cognitive function and preexisting comorbidities who exhibit delay in functional recovery at 3 months post discharge may be at high risk for hospital readmission and death.\n\n With the scarcity of resources, a future risk stratification system based on these findings might be proven helpful to target older patients who are likely to benefit from interventional strategies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1557854","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ali","surname":"El Solh","email":"solh@buffalo.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lilibeth","surname":"Pineda","email":"lpineda@buffalo.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pam","surname":"Bouquin","email":"pbouquin@ams.ecmc.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Corey","surname":"Mankowski","email":"cmankowski@ams.ecmc.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/archinte.167.15.1655","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Understanding the inflammatory cytokine response in pneumonia and sepsis: results of the Genetic and Inflammatory Markers of Sepsis (GenIMS) study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jcrc.2009.05.002","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Systemic and bronchoalveolar cytokines as predictors of in-hospital mortality in severe community-acquired pneumonia","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s10753-014-9840-2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Contrasting Inflammatory Responses in Severe and Non-severe Community-acquired Pneumonia","abstract":"Electronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10753-014-9840-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7087758","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rafael","surname":"Fernandez-Botran","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Silvia M.","surname":"Uriarte","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Forest W.","surname":"Arnold","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lisandra","surname":"Rodriguez-Hernandez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Madhavi J.","surname":"Rane","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paula","surname":"Peyrani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Timothy","surname":"Wiemken","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Kelley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Srinivas","surname":"Uppatla","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rodrigo","surname":"Cavallazzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francesco","surname":"Blasi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Letizia","surname":"Morlacchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefano","surname":"Aliberti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Colleen","surname":"Jonsson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julio A.","surname":"Ramirez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jose","surname":"Bordon","email":"jbordon@provhosp.org","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1097/CCM.0000000000000100","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Immunological characterization of compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome in patients with severe sepsis: a longitudinal study*","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1164/rccm.201606-1225OC","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The host response in patients with sepsis developing intensive care unit-acquired secondary infections","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1378/chest.107.4.1062","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Persistent elevation of inflammatory cytokines predicts a poor outcome in ARDS.

1690 patients and over the following 7 days for the 840 patients who received placebo (in addition to usual standard of care).\n\n\nMethods\nNineteen biomarkers of coagulation activation, anticoagulation, fibrinolysis, endothelial injury, and inflammation were analyzed to determine the relationships between baseline values and their change over time, with 28-day survival, and type of infecting causative micro-organism.\n\n\nResults\nLevels of 13 of the 19 biomarkers at baseline correlated with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, and nearly all patients exhibited coagulopathy, endothelial injury, and inflammation at baseline.\n\n At study entry, elevated D-dimer, thrombin–antithrombin complexes, IL-6, and prolonged prothrombin time were present in 99.7%, 95.5%, 98.5%, and 93.4% of patients, respectively.\n\n Markers of endothelial injury (soluble thrombomodulin) and deficient protein C, protein S, and antithrombin were apparent in 72%, 87.6%,

evolutionary medicine perspective","abstract":"Background\nCoagulation and innate immunity have been linked together for at least 450 million years of evolution.\n\n Sepsis, one of the world’s leading causes of death, is probably the condition in which this evolutionary link is more evident.\n\n However, the biological and the clinical relevance of this association have only recently gained the attention of the scientific community.\n\n\nDiscussion\nDuring sepsis, the host response to a pathogen is invariably associated with coagulation activation.\n\n For several years, coagulation activation has been solely regarded as a mechanism of tissue damage, a concept that led to several clinical trials of anticoagulant agents for sepsis.\n\n More recently, this paradigm has been challenged by the failure of these clinical trials, and by a growing bulk of evidence supporting the concept that coagulation activation is beneficial for pathogen clearance.\n\n In this article we discuss recent basic and clinical data that point to a more balanced view of the detrimental and beneficial consequences of coagulation activation in sepsis.\n\n\nSummary\nReappraisal of the association between coagulation and immune activation from an evolutionary medicine perspective offers a unique opportunity to gain new insights about the pathogenesis of sepsis, paving the way to more successful approaches in both basic and clinical research in this field.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4422540","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maiara Marx

septic shock","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality and critical illness worldwide and is associated with an increased mortality rate in the months following hospital discharge.\n\n The occurrence of persistent or new organ dysfunction(s) after septic shock raises questions about the mechanisms involved in the post-sepsis status.\n\n The present study aimed to explore the immune profiles of patients one year after being discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) following treatment for abdominal septic shock.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We conducted a prospective, single-center, observational study in the surgical ICU of a university hospital.\n\n Eighty-six consecutive patients admitted for septic shock of abdominal origin were included in this study.\n\n Fifteen different plasma biomarkers were measured at ICU admission, at ICU discharge and at one year after ICU discharge.\n\n Three different clusters of biomarkers were distinguished according to their functions, namely: (1) inflammatory response, (2) cell damage and apoptosis, (3) immunosuppression and resolution of inflammation.\n\n The primary objective was to characterize variations in the immune status of septic shock patients admitted to ICU up to one year after ICU discharge.\n\n The secondary objective was to evaluate the relationship between these biomarker variations and patient outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>At the onset of septic shock, we observed a cohesive pro-inflammatory profile and low levels of inflammation resolution markers.\n\n At ICU discharge, the immune status demonstrated decreased but persistent inflammation and increased immunosuppression, with elevated programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) levels, and a counterbalanced resolution process, with elevated levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10), resolvin D5 (RvD5), and IL-7. One year after hospital discharge, homeostasis was not completely restored with several markers of inflammation remaining elevated.\n\n Remarkably, IL-7 was persistently elevated, with levels comparable to those observed after ICU discharge, and PD-1, while lower, remained in the elevated abnormal range.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>In this study, protracted immune disturbances were observed one year after ICU discharge.\n\n The study results suggested the presence of long-lasting immune illness disorders following a long-term septic insult, indicating the need for long-term patient follow up after ICU discharge and questioning the use of immune intervention to restore immune homeostasis after abdominal septic shock.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online

of an adequate pool of functional mitochondria is crucial for tissue homeostasis.\n Their unique role in energy supply makes these organelles essential, especially in those tissues strictly dependent on oxidative metabolism.\n Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) is ensured by pathways related to protein folding and degradation as well as by processes involving the entire organelle, such as biogenesis, dynamics, and mitophagy.\n Dysfunctional MQC, oxidative stress and inflammation are hallmarks of senescence and chronic degenerative diseases.\n One of the consequences of age-related failing MQC and oxidative stress is the release of mitochondria-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).\n Through their bacterial ancestry, these molecules contribute to mounting an inflammatory response by interacting with receptors similar to those involved in pathogen-associated responses.\n Mitochondrial DAMPs, especially cell-free mitochondrial DNA, have recently become the subject of intensive research because of their possible involvement in conditions associated with inflammation, such as aging and degenerative diseases.\n Here, we review the contribution of mitochondrial DAMPs to inflammation and discuss some of the mechanisms at the basis of their

signature of glucocorticoid receptor binding in neuronal PC12 cells","abstract":"Background\nGlucocorticoids, secreted by the adrenals in response to stress, profoundly affect structure and plasticity of neurons.\n\n Glucocorticoid action in neurons is mediated by glucocorticoid receptors (GR) that operate as transcription factors in the regulation of gene expression and either bind directly to genomic glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) or indirectly to the genome via interactions with bound transcription factors.\n\n These two modes of action, respectively called transactivation and transrepression, result in the regulation of a wide variety of genes important for neuronal function.\n\n The objective of the present study was to identify genome-wide glucocorticoid receptor binding sites in neuronal PC12 cells using Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation combined with next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq).\n\n\nResults\nIn total we identified 1183 genomic binding sites of GR, the majority of which were novel and not identified in other ChIP-Seq studies on GR binding.\n\n More than half (58%) of the binding sites contained a GRE.\n\n The remaining 42% of the GBS did not harbour a GRE and therefore likely bind GR via an intermediate transcription factor tethering GR to the DNA.\n\n While the GRE-containing binding sites were more often located nearby genes involved in general cell functions and processes such as apoptosis, cell motion, protein dimerization activity and vasculature development, the binding sites without a GRE were located nearby genes with a clear role in neuronal processes such as neuron projection morphogenesis, neuron projection regeneration, synaptic transmission and catecholamine biosynthetic process.\n\n A closer look at the sequence of the GR

Their Encounter with Apoptotic Leukocytes during the Resolution of Inflammation","abstract":"Monocytes that migrate into tissues during inflammatory episodes and differentiate to macrophages were previously classified as classically (M1) or alternatively (M2) activated macrophages, based on their exposure to different fate-determining mediators.\n These macrophage subsets display distinct molecular markers and differential functions.\n At the same time, studies from recent years found that the encounter of apoptotic leukocytes with macrophages leads to the clearance of this cellular “debris” by the macrophages, while concomitantly reprogramming/immune-silencing the macrophages.\n While some of the features of M2 differentiation, such as arginase-1 (murine) and 15-lipoxygenases (human and murine) expression, were also displayed by macrophages following the engulfment of apoptotic cells, it was not clear whether apoptotic cells can be regarded as an M2-like differentiating signal.\n In this manuscript we review the recent information regarding the impact of apoptotic cells on macrophage phenotype changes in molecular terms.\n We will focus on recent evidence for the in vivo existence of distinct pro-resolving macrophages and the role of apoptotic cells, specialized lipid mediators, and glucocorticoids in their generation.\n Consequently, we will suggest that these pro-resolving CD11blow macrophages have metamorphed from M2-like macrophages, and modulated their protein profile to accommodate the changes in their

inflammation, especially interleukin-8 (IL-8) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFr), identify sepsis patients with a higher mortality.\n There are also some data that elevated levels of endothelial biomarkers can identify which patients with non-pulmonary sepsis will develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n If ARDS patients are divided among those with indirect versus direct lung injury, then there is an association of elevated levels of endothelial biomarkers in indirect injury and markers of inflammation and alveolar epithelial injury in patients with direct lung injury.\n New research suggests that the combination of biologic and clinical markers may make it possible to segregate patients with ARDS into hypo- versus hyper-inflammatory phenotypes that may have implications for therapeutic responses to fluid therapy.\n Taken together, the studies reviewed here support a primary role of the microcirculation in the pathogenesis and prognosis of ARDS after sepsis.\n Biological differences identified by molecular patterns could explain heterogeneity of treatment effects that are not explained by clinical factors alone.\n","id":"PMC5912282","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carolyn M.","surname":"Hendrickson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael

infection.\n During sepsis this locally adaptive response becomes manifest throughout the body, leading to dangerous host consequences.\n Increased leakiness in the pulmonary circulation contributes to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a complication of sepsis associated with 40% mortality.\n Understanding the molecular governance of vascular leak and inflammation has major diagnostic, prognostic, and potentially therapeutic implications for this common and pernicious disease.\n This review summarizes results from cell-based experiments, animal models, and observational human

role of vitamin C in mitigating oxidative injury-induced microcirculatory impairment and associated organ failure in ischemia/reperfusion or sepsis.\n Preclinical studies show that high-dose vitamin C can prevent or restore microcirculatory flow impairment by inhibiting activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase, augmenting tetrahydrobiopterin, preventing uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and decreasing the formation of superoxide and peroxynitrite, and by directly scavenging superoxide.\n Vitamin C can additionally restore vascular responsiveness to vasoconstrictors, preserve endothelial barrier by maintaining cyclic guanylate phosphatase and occludin phosphorylation and preventing apoptosis.\n Finally, high-dose vitamin C can augment antibacterial defense.\n These protective effects against overwhelming oxidative stress due to ischemia/reperfusion, sepsis or burn seems to mitigate organ injury and dysfunction, and promote recovery after cardiac revascularization and in critically ill patients, in the latter partially in combination with other antioxidants.\n Of note, several questions remain to be solved, including optimal dose, timing and combination of vitamin C with other antioxidants.\n The combination obviously offers a synergistic effect and seems reasonable during sustained critical illness.\n High-dose vitamin C, however, provides a cheap, strong and multifaceted antioxidant, especially robust for resuscitation of the circulation.\n Vitamin C given as early as possible after the injurious event, or before if feasible, seems most effective.\n The latter could be considered at the start of cardiac surgery, organ transplant or major gastrointestinal surgery.\n Preoperative supplementation should consider the inhibiting effect of vitamin C on ischemic preconditioning.\n In critically ill patients, future research should focus on the use of short-term high-dose intravenous vitamin C as a resuscitation drug, to intervene as early as possible in the oxidant cascade in order to optimize macrocirculation and microcirculation and limit cellular injury.\n","id":"PMC4423646","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Heleen M","surname":"Oudemans-van

implications for therapy","abstract":"Multiple experimental and human trials have shown that microcirculatory alterations are frequent in sepsis.\n In this review, we discuss the characteristics of these alterations, the various mechanisms potentially involved, and the implications for therapy.\n Sepsis-induced microvascular alterations are characterized by a decrease in capillary density with an increased number of stopped-flow and intermittent-flow capillaries, in close vicinity to well-perfused capillaries.\n Accordingly, the surface available for exchange is decreased but also is highly heterogeneous.\n Multiple mechanisms may contribute to these alterations, including endothelial dysfunction, impaired inter-cell communication, altered glycocalyx, adhesion and rolling of white blood cells and platelets, and altered red blood cell deformability.\n Given the heterogeneous nature of these alterations and the mechanisms potentially involved, classical hemodynamic interventions, such as fluids, red blood cell transfusions, vasopressors, and inotropic agents, have only a limited impact, and the microcirculatory changes often persist after resuscitation.\n Nevertheless, fluids seem to improve the microcirculation in the early phase of sepsis and dobutamine also can improve the microcirculation, although the magnitude of this effect varies considerably among patients.\n Finally, maintaining a sufficient perfusion pressure seems to positively influence the microcirculation; however, which mean arterial pressure levels should be targeted remains controversial.\n Some trials using vasodilating agents, especially nitroglycerin, showed promising initial results but they were challenged in other trials, so it is difficult to recommend the use of these agents in current practice.\n Other agents can markedly improve the microcirculation, including activated protein C and antithrombin, vitamin C, or steroids.\n In conclusion, microcirculatory alterations may play an important role in the development of sepsis-related organ dysfunction.\n At this stage, therapies to target microcirculation specifically are still being investigated.\n","id":"PMC3224481","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"De

Upregulation of Uncoupling Protein 2 in Hyperglycemic Endothelial Cells","abstract":"Diabetic complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients.\n Elevated blood glucose contributes to the development of endothelial and vascular dysfunction, and, consequently, to diabetic micro- and macrovascular complications, because it increases the mitochondrial proton gradient and mitochondrial oxidant production.\n Therapeutic approaches designed to counteract glucose-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the vasculature are expected to show efficacy against all diabetic complications, but direct pharmacological targeting (scavenging) of mitochondrial oxidants remains challenging due to the high reactivity of some of these oxidant species.\n In a recent study, we have conducted a medium-throughput cell-based screening of a focused library of well-annotated pharmacologically active compounds and identified glucocorticoids as inhibitors of mitochondrial superoxide production in microvascular endothelial cells exposed to elevated extracellular glucose.\n The goal of the current study was to investigate the mechanism of glucocorticoids' action.\n Our findings show that glucocorticoids induce the expression of the mitochondrial UCP2 protein and decrease the mitochondrial potential.\n UCP2 silencing prevents the protective effect of the glucocorticoids on ROS production.\n UCP2 induction also increases the oxygen consumption and the “proton leak” in microvascular endothelial cells.\n Furthermore, glutamine supplementation augments the effect of glucocorticoids via further enhancing the expression of UCP2 at the translational level.\n We conclude that UCP2 induction represents a novel experimental therapeutic intervention in diabetic vascular complications.\n While direct repurposing of glucocorticoids may not be possible for the therapy of diabetic complications due to their significant side effects that develop during chronic administration, the UCP2 pathway may be therapeutically targetable by other, glucocorticoid-independent pharmacological means.\n","id":"PMC4851329","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Domokos","surname":"Gerö","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Csaba","surname":"Szabo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Csaba","surname":"Szabo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jan

hypothesis that ACTH secretion is decreased secondarily to alteration of CRH or AVP synthesis, we undertook a neuropathological study of the antehypophyseal system in patients who had died from septic shock and rats with experimental faecal peritonitis.\n\n\nMethods\nBrains obtained in 9 septic shock patients were compared to 10 nonseptic patients (controls).\n\n Parvocellular expression of AVP and CRH mRNA were evaluated by in situ hybridization.\n\n Antehypophyseal expression of ACTH, vasopressin V1b and CRH R1 receptors and parvocellular expression of iNOS in the PVN were evaluated by immunohistochemistry.\n\n The same experiments were carried out in a fecal peritonitis-induced model of sepsis.\n\n Data from septic rats with (n?=?6) or without (n?=?10) early death were compared to

increased expression of parvocellular iNOS compared to controls.\n\n Septic shock was also characterized by an increased expression of CRH mRNA in rats but not in patients, who notably had a greater duration of septic shock.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe present study suggests that in humans and in rats, septic shock is associated with decreased ACTH synthesis that is not compensated by its two natural

The uniform rise in ACTH and cortisol to supra-normal levels 1 week after ICU discharge indicates recovery of a central adrenocortical suppression while in ICU.\n\n Low cortisol plasma binding invalidates the cosyntropin test.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00134-018-5366-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to

serum levels have been associated with inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis (MS), atherosclerosis, or asthma.\n Genome- and transcriptome-wide studies indicate that vitamin D signaling modulates many inflammatory responses on several levels.\n This includes (i) the regulation of the expression of genes which generate pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenases or 5-lipoxygenase, (ii) the interference with transcription factors, such as NF-?B, which regulate the expression of inflammatory genes and (iii) the activation of signaling cascades, such as MAP kinases which mediate inflammatory responses.\n Vitamin D targets various tissues and cell types, a number of which belong to the immune system, such as monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) as well as B- and T cells, leading to individual responses of each cell type.\n One hallmark of these specific vitamin D effects is the cell-type specific regulation of genes involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes and the interplay between vitamin D signaling and other signaling cascades involved in inflammation.\n An important task in the near future will be the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses by vitamin D on the molecular level by the use of techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), ChIP-seq, and

lines have been used to study whether vitamin D has immune modulating effects; however, to date a detailed systematic review describing the published evidence has not been completed.\n We therefore conducted a systematic review on the effect of vitamin D on the protein expression and secretion of inflammatory markers by human-derived immune cells.\n The review was registered at the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, Registration number CRD42015023222).\n A literature search was conducted using Pubmed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science and Medline.\n The search strategy used the following search terms: Vitamin D or cholecalciferol or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin or 25-hydroxy-Vitamin D and Inflam* or cytokine* and supplement* or cell*.\n These terms were searched in the abstract, title and keywords.\n Inclusion criteria for study selection consisted of human-derived immune cell lines or cellular studies where PBMCs were obtained from humans, reported in the English language, and within the time period of 2000 to 2015. The selection protocol was mapped according to PRISMA guidelines.\n Twenty three studies (7 cell line and 16 PBMCs studies) met our criteria.\n All studies selected except one used the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2, with one study using cholecalciferol and two studies also using 25(OH)D.\n Four out of seven cell line studies showed an anti-inflammatory effect where suppression of key markers such as macrophage chemotactic protein 1, interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 were observed.\n Fourteen of sixteen PBMC studies also showed a similar anti-inflammatory effect based on common inflammatory endpoints.\n Mechanisms for such effects included decreased protein expression of toll-like receptor-2 and toll-like receptor-4; lower levels of phosphorylated p38 and p42/42; reduced expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and decreased reactive oxygen species.\n This review demonstrates that an anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin D is a consistent observation in studies of cell lines and human derived PBMCs.\n","id":"PMC4631349","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emily K.","surname":"Calton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kevin N.","surname":"Keane","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philip","surname":"Newsholme","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mario J.","surname":"Soares","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephen J","surname":"Polyak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephen J","surname":"Polyak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/0310057X1704500106","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Altered blood levels of Vitamin D, cathelicidin and parathyroid hormone in patients with sepsis-a pilot study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1093/emboj/20.24.7108","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Glucocorticoids inhibit MAP kinase via increased expression and decreased degradation of MKP-1","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.4049/jimmunol.1102412","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Vitamin D inhibits monocyte/macrophage proinflammatory cytokine production by targeting MAPK phosphatase-1","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jaci.2013.12.004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Anti-inflammatory and corticosteroid-enhancing actions of Vitamin D in monocytes of patients with steroid-resistant and those with steroid-sensitive asthma","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.18632/oncotarget.13997","date":"2016-12-14","title":"Vitamin D affects glucocorticoid action in target cells","abstract":"","id":"PMC5352312","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Eva","surname":"Kassi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Narjes","surname":"Nasiri-Ansari","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Athanasios G.","surname":"Papavassiliou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68971-X","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Are statins analogues of Vitamin D?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Vitamin D augments glucocorticosteroid efficacy via inhibition of mTORc1","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/1479-5876-11-176","date":"2013-07-01","title":"Vitamin d deficiency impacts on expression of toll-like receptor-2 and cytokine profile: a pilot study","abstract":"Background\nVitamin D is believed to play an important role outside the endocrine system in the regulation of the immune system, and in cellular proliferation and differentiation.\n\n The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of vitamin D levels on innate immunity.\n\n\nMethods\nParticipants for this prospective, longitudinal study were recruited amongst otherwise healthy staff of a large hospital in Victoria, Australia.\n\n Those fulfilling the inclusion criteria, including a vitamin D level of &lt;50 nmol/L, were supplemented.\n\n Using flow cytometry, expression of the innate immune receptors TLR2, TLR4 and CD86 was measured on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected prior to vitamin D treatment and then at 1 and 3 months.\n\n Additonally, PBMCs at each timepoint were stimulated with specific TLR ligands and resultant supernatants were assayed for the cytokines TNF?, IL-6, IFN-?

(ascorbic acid) plays important roles as an anti-oxidant and in collagen synthesis.\n These important roles, and the relatively large amounts of vitamin C required daily, likely explain why most vertebrate species are able to synthesize this compound.\n Surprisingly, many species, such as teleost fishes, anthropoid primates, guinea pigs, as well as some bat and Passeriformes bird species, have lost the capacity to synthesize it.\n Here, we review the genetic bases behind the repeated losses in the ability to synthesize vitamin C as well as their implications.\n In all cases so far studied, the inability to synthesize vitamin C is due to mutations in the L-gulono-?-lactone oxidase (GLO) gene which codes for the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the last step of vitamin C biosynthesis.\n The bias for mutations in this particular gene is likely due to the fact that losing it only affects vitamin C production.\n Whereas the GLO gene mutations in fish, anthropoid primates and guinea pigs are irreversible, some of the GLO pseudogenes found in bat species have been shown to be reactivated during evolution.\n The same phenomenon is thought to have occurred in some Passeriformes bird species.\n Interestingly, these GLO gene losses and reactivations are unrelated to the diet of the species involved.\n This suggests that losing the ability to make vitamin C is a neutral

randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I trial was to determine the safety of intravenously infused ascorbic acid in patients with severe sepsis.\n\n\nMethods\nTwenty-four patients with severe sepsis in the medical intensive care unit were randomized 1:1:1 to receive intravenous infusions every six hours for four days of ascorbic acid: Lo-AscA (50 mg/kg/24 h, n?=?8), or Hi-AscA (200 mg/kg/24 h, n?=?8), or Placebo (5% dextrose/water, n?=?8).\n\n The primary end points were ascorbic acid safety and tolerability, assessed as treatment-related adverse-event frequency and severity.\n\n Patients were monitored for worsened arterial hypotension, tachycardia, hypernatremia, and nausea or vomiting.\n\n In addition Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and plasma levels of ascorbic acid, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and thrombomodulin were monitored.\n\n\nResults\nMean plasma ascorbic acid levels at entry for the entire cohort were 17.9?±?2.4 ?M

between the timing of low-dose steroid therapy and the outcome has not been evaluated.\n\n Therefore, we evaluated whether early initiation of low-dose steroid therapy is associated with mortality in patients with septic shock.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 178 patients who received low-dose corticosteroid therapy for septic shock between January 2008 and December 2009. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding factors in the association between the time to initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy and in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nResults\nThe study population consisted of 107 men and 71 women with a median age of 66 (interquartile range, 54 to 71) years.\n\n The 28-day mortality was 44% and low-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated within a median of 8.5 (3.8 to 19.1) hours after onset of septic shock-related hypotension.\n\n Median time to initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy was significantly shorter in survivors than in non-survivors (6.5 hours versus 10.4 hours; P = 0.0135).\n\n The mortality rates increased significantly with increasing quintiles of time to initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy (P = 0.0107 for trend).\n\n Other factors associated with 28-day mortality were higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) 3 (P &lt; 0.0001) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (P = 0.0007), dose of vasopressor at the time of initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy (P &lt; 0.0001), need for mechanical ventilation (P = 0.0001) and renal replacement therapy (P &lt; 0.0001), while the impaired adrenal reserve did not affect 28-day mortality (81% versus 82%; P = 0.8679).\n\n After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the time to initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy was still significantly associated with 28-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.025, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.007 to 1.044, P = 0.0075).\n\n The early therapy group (administered within 6 hours after the onset of septic shock, n = 66) had a 37% lower mortality rate than the late therapy group (administered more than 6 hours after the onset of septic shock, n = 112) (32% versus 51%, P = 0.0132).\n\n\nConclusions\nEarly initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy was significantly associated with decreased mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3396228","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hye Yun","surname":"Park","email":"kerrybe.park@samsung.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gee Young","surname":"Suh","email":"suhgy@skku.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jae-Uk","surname":"Song","email":"jaeukjh.song@samsung.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongseok","surname":"Yoo","email":"hongseok.yoo@samsung.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ik Joon","surname":"Jo","email":"ikjoon.jo@samsung.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tae Gun","surname":"Shin","email":"taegun.shin@samsung.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"So Yeon","surname":"Lim","email":"happyyeon.lim@samsung.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sookyoung","surname":"Woo","email":"sookyoung12.woo@samsung.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kyeongman","surname":"Jeon","email":"kjeon@skku.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60777-0","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Glucocorticoid treatment in community-acquired pneumonia","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa1705716","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone for adults with septic shock","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3389/fimmu.2018.01736","date":"2018-07-13","title":"Immune Effects of Corticosteroids in Sepsis","abstract":"Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction, results from a dysregulated host response to invading pathogens that may be characterized by overwhelming systemic inflammation or some sort of immune paralysis.\n Sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality.\n Treatment is nonspecific and relies on source control and organ support.\n Septic shock, the most severe form of sepsis is associated with the highest rate of mortality.\n Two large multicentre trials, undertaken 15?years apart, found that the combination of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone significantly reduces mortality in septic shock.\n The corticosteroids family is composed of several molecules that are usually characterized according to their glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid power, relative to hydrocortisone.\n While the immune effects of glucocorticoids whether mediated or not by the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor have been investigated for several decades, it is only very recently that potential immune effects of mineralocorticoids via non-renal mineralocorticoid receptors have gained popularity.\n We reviewed the respective role of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids in counteracting sepsis-associated dysregulated immune systems.\n","id":"PMC6077259","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicholas","surname":"Heming","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sivanthiny","surname":"Sivanandamoorthy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paris","surname":"Meng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rania","surname":"Bounab","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Djillali","surname":"Annane","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1161/01.CIR.95.5.1122","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Vasopressin deficiency contributes to the vasodilation of septic shock","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/01.CCM.0000063046.82359.4A","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Circulating vasopressin levels in septic shock","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181961ace","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Dieter ayers for the, and I.

Demographic data, comorbidities, medical management details, adverse effects related to corticosteroids, and outcomes were collected after the critical care physician indicated initiation of

(Covid-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage.\n\n Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care.\n\n Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P&lt;0.001).\n\n The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization.\n\n In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs.\n\n 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs.\n\n 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs.\n\n 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.\n\n (Funded by the Medical Research Council and

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on

person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020.

The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67·9% and specificity of 78·2% (AUC=0·730).\n\n The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms.\n\n This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7196382","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qilin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiuli","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geqing","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heng-Gui","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fenghua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luming","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shijun","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"An","surname":"Pan","email":"panan@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Wang","email":"lin_wang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Wang","email":"zhengwang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017","date":"2020-03-09","title":"Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","abstract":"This case series study evaluates the association of underlying cardiovascular disease and myocardial injury on fatal outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n","id":"PMC7101506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongzhen","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hairong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinghuan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibing","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.

cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already occur.\n\n\nAim\nWe aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available.\n\n\nMethods\nHere we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology.\n\n\nResults\nThe workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from SARS-CoV.\n\n Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses.\n\n Control material is made available through European Virus Archive – Global (EVAg), a European Union infrastructure project.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe present study demonstrates the enormous response capacity

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

in Shanghai from May 2015 to May 2019 were recruited.\n\n Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was used to detect respiratory viruses.\n\n Demographic information, comorbidities, routine laboratory examinations, immunological indexes, etiological detections, radiological images and treatment were collected on admission.\n\n\nResults\n76 (14.4%) patients died within 90 days in hospital.\n\n A predictive MuLBSTA score was calculated on the basis of a multivariate logistic regression model in order to predict mortality with a weighted score that included multilobular infiltrates (OR = 5.20, 95% CI 1.41–12.52, p = 0.010; 5 points), lymphocyte ? 0.8?109/L (OR = 4.53, 95% CI 2.55–8.05, p &lt; 0.001; 4 points), bacterial coinfection (OR = 3.71, 95% CI 2.11–6.51, p &lt; 0.001; 4 points), acute-smoker (OR = 3.19, 95% CI 1.34–6.26, p = 0.001; 3 points), quit-smoker (OR = 2.18, 95% CI 0.99–4.82, p = 0.054; 2 points), hypertension (OR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.55–4.26, p = 0.003; 2 points) and age ?60 years (OR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.04–4.39, p = 0.038; 2 points).\n\n 12 points was used as a cut-off value for mortality risk stratification.\n\n This model showed sensitivity of 0.776, specificity of 0.778 and a better predictive ability than CURB-65 (AUROC = 0.773 vs.\n\n 0.717, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nHere, we designed an easy-to-use clinically predictive tool for assessing 90-day mortality risk of viral pneumonia.\n\n It can accurately stratify hospitalized patients with viral pneumonia into relevant risk categories and could provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6901688","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lingxi","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dong","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xinxin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yurong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qingyun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jieming","surname":"Qu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study.\n\n Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed.\n\n Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group.\n\n Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test.\n\n Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test.\n\n Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression.\n\n\nResults\nSeventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study.\n\n Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized.\n\n The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs.\n\n 37 [32, 41] years, U?=?4.932, P?=?0.001).\n\n The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs.\n\n 3.0%, ?2?=?9.291, P?=?0.018).\n\n For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs.\n\n 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]°C, U?=?2.057, P?=?0.027).\n\n Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs.\n\n 20.9%, ?2?=?5.611, P?=?0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs.\n\n 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U?=?4.030, P?=?0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group.\n\n C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs.\n\n 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U?=?1.315, P?=?0.024).\n\n Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62?±?6.60 vs.\n\n 41.27?±?4.55?g/L, U?=?2.843, P?=?0.006).\n\n Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (?2?=?16.01, P?=?0.001).\n\n Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546;
