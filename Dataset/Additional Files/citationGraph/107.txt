Therefore, in order to mitigate the negative psychosocial effects of home confinement, implementation of national strategies focused on promoting social inclusion through a technology-based solution is strongly suggested.\n","id":"PMC7503681","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_Core_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Achraf","surname":"Ammar","email":"NULL","contributions":"13"},{"firstname":"

outbreak, social distancing and self-isolation have been suggested to generate a burden throughout the population.\n To provide scientific data to help identify risk factors for the psychosocial strain during the COVID-19 outbreak, an international cross-disciplinary online survey was circulated in April 2020. This report outlines the mental, emotional and behavioural consequences of COVID-19 home confinement.\n The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists, following a structured review of the literature.\n The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform and was promoted by thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North Africa, Western Asia and the Americas.\n Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses “before” and “during” the confinement period.\n 1047 replies (54% women) from Western Asia (36%), North Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other continents (3%) were analysed.\n The COVID-19 home confinement evoked a negative effect on mental wellbeing and emotional status (P &lt; 0.001; 0.43 ? d ? 0.65) with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing psychosocial and emotional disorders (+10% to +16.5%).\n These psychosocial tolls were associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing (i) physical (+15.2%) and social (+71.2%) inactivity, (ii) poor sleep quality (+12.8%), (iii) unhealthy diet behaviours (+10%), and (iv) unemployment (6%).\n Conversely, participants demonstrated a greater use (+15%) of technology during the confinement period.\n These findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the COVID-19 home confinement period and provide a clear remit for the urgent implementation of technology-based intervention to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: rapid review of the evidence","abstract":"The December, 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility.\n Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence.\n We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases.\n Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review.\n Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger.\n Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma.\n Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects.\n In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided.\n Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.\n","id":"PMC7158942","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Samantha K","surname":"Brooks","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rebecca K","surname":"Webster","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Louise E","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lisa","surname":"Woodland","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Wessely","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neil","surname":"Greenberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gideon James","surname":"Rubin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030371","date":"2020-01-30","title":"Impact of isolation on hospitalised patients who are infectious: systematic review with meta-analysis","abstract":"Objective\nTo systematically review the literature exploring the impact of isolation on hospitalised patients who are infectious: psychological and non-psychological outcomes.\n\n\nDesign\nSystematic review with meta-analysis.\n\n\nData sources\nEmbase, Medline and PsycINFO were searched from inception until December 2018.

the short Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS): findings from the Health Survey for England","abstract":"Purpose\nThe Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), 14 positively worded statements, is a validated instrument to measure mental wellbeing on a population level.\n\n Less is known about the population distribution of the shorter seven-item version (SWEMWBS) or its performance as an instrument to measure wellbeing.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing the Health Survey for England 2010–2013 (n = 27,169 adults aged 16+, nationally representative of the population), age- and sex-specific norms were estimated using means and percentiles.\n\n Criterion validity was examined using: (1) Spearman correlations (?) for SWEMWBS with General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), happiness index, EQ-VAS (2) a multinomial logit model with SWEMWBS (low, medium and high wellbeing) as the outcome and demographic, social and health behaviours as explanatory variables.\n\n Relative validity was examined by comparing SWEMWBS with WEMWBS using: (1) Spearman correlations (continuous data), and (2) the weighted kappa statistic (categorical), within population subgroups.\n\n\nResults\nMean (median) SWEMWBS was 23.7 (23.2) for men and 23.2 (23.2) for women (p = 0.100).\n\n Spearman correlations were moderately sized for the happiness index (? = 0.53, P &lt; 0.001), GHQ-12 (? = ?0.52, p &lt; 0.001) and EQ-VAS (? = 0.40, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Participants consuming &lt;1 portion of fruit and vegetables a day versus ?5 (odds ratio = 1.43 95% Confidence Interval = (1.22–1.66)) and current smokers versus non-smokers (1.28 (1.15–1.41)) were more likely to have low vs medium wellbeing.\n\n Participants who binge drank versus non-drinkers were less likely to have high versus medium wellbeing (0.81 (0.71–0.92)).\n\n Spearman correlations between SWEMWBS and WEMWBS were above 0.95; weighted kappa statistics showed almost perfect agreement (0.79–0.85).\n\n\nConclusion\nSWEMWBS distinguishes mental wellbeing between subgroups, similarly to WEMWBS, but is less sensitive to gender differences.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe

hampered by lack of valid measures that are responsive to change.\n\n The objective of this study was to evaluate the responsiveness of the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) at both the individual and group level.\n\n\nMethods\nSecondary analysis of twelve different interventional studies undertaken in different populations using WEMWBS as an outcome measure.\n\n Standardised

individual level, respectively.\n\n\nResults\nMean change in WEMWBS score ranged from ?0.6 to 10.6. SRM ranged from ?0.10 (95% CI: -0.35, 0.15) to 1.35 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.64).\n\n In 9/12 studies the lower limit of the 95% CI for P? was greater than 0.5, denoting responsiveness.\n\n SEM ranged from 2.4 to 3.1 units, and at the threshold 2.77 SEM, WEMWBS detected important improvement in at least 12.8% to 45.7% of participants (lower limit of 95% CI&gt;5.0%).\n\n\nConclusions\nWEMWBS is

Activity: Results of the ECLB-COVID19 International Online Survey","abstract":"Background: Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home confinement.\n While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined.\n Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions.\n This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours.\n Methods: Following a structured review of the literature, the “Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19)” Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics.\n The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform.\n Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages.\n Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses “before” and “during” confinement conditions.\n Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis.\n The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall).\n Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day.\n Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly.\n Conclusion: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction.\n A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.\n","id":"PMC7352706","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Achraf","surname":"Ammar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Khaled","surname":"Trabelsi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamdi","surname":"Chtourou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Boukhris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liwa","surname":"Masmoudi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bassem","surname":"Bouaziz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ellen","surname":"Bentlage","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniella","surname":"How","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Notger","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Asma","surname":"Aloui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Hammouda","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laisa

time in children is not only due to screen media use: a cross-sectional study","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Sedentary behaviour has become a growing public health concern.\n\n Currently, it is a common belief that screen time (SCT) is a key factor in high overall sedentary time (ST) and is often used as a primary outcome.\n\n However, the evidence is lacking.\n\n Therefore, this study investigated the association of objectively assessed total ST with SCT among children.\n\n Further, SCT was investigated separately for sedentary level, weight status, gender, and migration background.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>For 198 primary school children (7.1?±?0.7?years, boys: 43.9%) ST was assessed objectively using a multi-sensor device (Actiheart®; CamNtech, Cambridge, UK).\n\n The sample was split into three groups (tertiles) to investigate SCT of children with low, medium and high ST.\n\n SCT and socio-demographic parameters, such as migration background, were assessed using a parental questionnaire; anthropometric data was collected at schools.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Absolut SCT did not differ significantly among the three sedentary groups: Daily average of SCT was 83.8?±?55.0?min (27.4% of ST) for children with high ST, 82.8?±?50.5?min (39.8% of ST) for children with medium ST, and 77.2?±?59.4?min (71.3% of ST) for those with low ST.\n\n However, relatively the SCT percentage of total ST was significantly higher among children with low ST (p?&lt;?0.01).\n\n Significantly higher SCT was found in children with migration background (p?&lt;?0.01), while underweight children had significantly less SCT (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n An association of total SCT and overall ST was found for the whole sample (B?=?17.11, [2.75; 31.48], p?=?0.02), but did not remain when analysis were separated for the groups, except for normal weight children (B?=?15.97, [0.13; 31.81], p?=?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>The amount of SCT is the same among high, low and medium sedentary children, and high ST is largely independent of SCT.\n\n Therefore, SCT cannot be the key contributor to high ST and should not solely be used for predicting or changing children’s sedentary behaviour.\n\n Moreover, children’s weight status to classify activity levels and the role of possible compensation mechanisms should be considered in future research and when trying to intervene on ST.\n\n\nTrial registration\nid='Par5'>German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS), DRKS-ID: DRKS00000494 DATE:

Interval = (1.22–1.66)) and current smokers versus non-smokers (1.28 (1.15–1.41)) were more likely to have low vs medium wellbeing.\n\n Participants who binge drank versus non-drinkers were less likely to have high versus medium wellbeing (0.81 (0.71–0.92)).\n\n Spearman correlations between SWEMWBS and WEMWBS were above 0.95; weighted kappa statistics showed almost perfect agreement (0.79–0.85).\n\n\nConclusion\nSWEMWBS distinguishes mental wellbeing between subgroups, similarly to WEMWBS, but is less sensitive to gender differences.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe

recommended as a cost-effective method to assess physical activity.\n\n Several studies validating the IPAQ-SF have been conducted with differing results, but no systematic review of these studies has been reported.\n\n\nMethods\nThe keywords 'IPAQ', 'validation', and 'validity' were searched in PubMed and Scopus.\n\n Studies published in English that validated the IPAQ-SF against an objective physical activity measuring device, doubly labeled water, or an objective fitness measure were included.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-three validation studies were included in this review.\n\n There was a great deal of variability in the methods used across studies, but the results were largely similar.\n\n Correlations between the total physical activity level measured by the IPAQ-SF and objective standards ranged from 0.09 to 0.39; none reached the minimal acceptable standard in the literature (0.50 for objective activity measuring devices, 0.40 for fitness measures).\n\n Correlations between sections of the IPAQ-SF for vigorous activity or moderate activity level/walking and an objective standard showed even greater variability (-0.18 to 0.76), yet several reached the minimal acceptable standard.\n\n Only six studies provided comparisons between physical activity levels derived from the IPAQ-SF and those obtained from objective criterion.\n\n In most studies the IPAQ-SF overestimated physical activity level by 36 to 173 percent; one study underestimated by 28 percent.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe correlation between the IPAQ-SF and objective measures of activity or fitness in the large majority of studies was lower than the acceptable standard.\n\n Furthermore, the IPAQ-SF typically overestimated physical activity as measured by objective criterion by an average of 84 percent.\n\n Hence, the evidence to support the use of the IPAQ-SF as an indicator of relative or absolute physical activity is weak.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3214824","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paul H","surname":"Lee","email":"paulhlee@hku.hk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Duncan

The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterised, and many research teams all over the world are working on prediction of the epidemic scenario, protective measures to populations and sub-populations, therapeutic and vaccination issues, amongst others.\n Contextually, countries with currently low numbers of Covid-19-infected individuals such as Tunisia are intended to take lessons from those countries which already reached the exponential phase of the infection distribution as well as from those which have the exponential phase behind them and record a minor number of new cases such as China.\n To this end, in Tunisia, the pandemic wave has started with a significant delay compared with Europe, the main economic partner of the country.\n In this paper, we do analyse the current pandemic situation in this country by studying the infection evolution and considering potential protective strategies to prevent a pandemic scenario.\n The model is predictive based on a large number of undetected Covid-19 cases that is particularly true for some country regions such as Sfax.\n Infection distribution and mortality rate analysis demonstrate a highly heterogeneous picture over the country.\n Qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis leads to a conclusion that the reliable “real-time” monitoring based on the randomised laboratory tests is the optimal predictive strategy to create the most effective evidence-based preventive measures.\n In contrast, lack of tests may lead to incorrect political decisions causing either unnecessary over-protection of the population that is risky for a long-term economic recession, or under-protection of the population leading to a post-containment pandemic rebound.\n Recommendations are provided in the context of advanced predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medical approach.\n","id":"PMC7182506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lotfi","surname":"Chaari","email":"lotfi.chaari@toulouse-inp.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Olga","surname":"Golubnitschaja","email":"Olga.Golubnitschaja@ukbonn.de","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.05.05.20091058","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Emotional consequences of COVID-19 home confinement: The ECLB-COVID19 multicenter study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/gpsych-2020-100213","date":"2020-02-29","title":"A nationwide survey of psychological distress among Chinese people in the COVID-19 epidemic: implications and policy recommendations","abstract":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic emerged in Wuhan, China, spread nationwide and then onto half a dozen other countries between December 2019 and early 2020.

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth.\n The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation.\n We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for

single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25,

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

and Psychological Well-Being of Individuals in Times of a Major Air Pollution Crisis","abstract":"Background\nCrisis situations bring about many challenges to researchers, public institutions, and governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire.\n\n Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access.\n\n\nIn addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6).\n\n The total Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n The perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level and the number of physical symptoms were associated with higher IES-R Score (P&lt;.\n\n05).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis is one of the first few studies demonstrating the use of Internet in data collection during an air-pollution crisis.\n\n Our results demonstrated that the newer technological modalities have the potential to acquire data, similar to that of conventional technologies.\n\n Demographic variables did not influence the mechanism of usage.\n\n In addition, our findings also suggested that there are acute physical and psychological impacts on the population from an air-pollution crisis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4114481","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sary","surname":"Beidas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sary","surname":"Beidas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fernando","surname":"Mora","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Monica","surname":"Murero","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Melvyn

agonist maintenance treatment (MMT) is used to treat opioid addiction by preventing opioid withdrawal and reducing cravings.\n\n However, it is important to note that mental conditions may persist, or even remain undetected while methadone maintenance treatment is ongoing.\n\n This study aimed to examine the level of psychological problems among MMT patients at public and private health facilities and identify associated factors.\n\n\nMethod\nid='Par2'>From January to September 2018, a cross-sectional study was performed in Nam Dinh province, one of the largest epicenters providing HIV/AIDS surveillance and treatment services in the North of Vietnam.\n\n 395 male respondents currently receiving MMT agreed to participate in a face-to-face interview.\n\n Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were used to assess psychological problems among patients.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The percentage of patients suffering from mild to extremely severe anxiety was the highest among psychological problems (18%).\n\n 2.8% of participants had mild depressive symptoms and the percentage of those having mild or moderate stress was approximately 4%.\n\n In addition, the longer treatment duration, the lower mental health scores regarding three types of psychological problems.\n\n Respondents who received MMT services in public health facilities were more likely to have a higher score of all psychological problems.\n\n Participants who lived with partners or spouse, having higher monthly family income had a lower likelihood of having severe depression and stress

adults) with 68 studies on single point prevalence, 9 studies on one-year prevalence, and 13 studies on lifetime prevalence of depression.\n A random-effects model meta-analysis that was performed to calculate the aggregate point, one-year and lifetime prevalence of depression calculated prevalences of 12.9%, 7.2% and 10.8% respectively.\n Point prevalence of depression was significantly higher in women (14.4%), countries with a medium human development index (HDI) (29.2%), studies published from 2004 to 2014 (15.4%) and when using self-reporting instruments (17.3%) to assess depression.\n Heterogeneity was identified by meta-regression and subgroup analysis, and response rate, percentage of women and year of publication, respectively, were determined contribute to depression prevalence.\n This meta-analysis allows benchmarking of the prevalence of depression during the era when online health information emerged, facilitating future comparisons.\n","id":"PMC5809481","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Grace Y.","surname":"Lim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wilson

applications among Vietnamese youth and young adults","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>As smartphone becomes increasingly prevalent and affordable, more youths today can own a smartphone device and download applications in various application stores.\n\n Smartphone applications have been proven to be useful for youths in various aspects.\n\n However, there has been a paucity of data looking into the preferences of Vietnamese youths and adolescents with regards to health-related applications and their receptiveness towards smartphone apps.\n\n Therefore, this study aimed to determine the receptiveness and preferences of health-related smartphone applications (mHealth apps) among online Vietnamese youths and adolescents.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>An online cross-sectional study was conducted between the periods of August till October 2015 in Vietnam.\n\n Respondent-driven sampling technique (RDS) was utilized to recruit participants.\n\n Participants were asked questions about their history of downloading and using health-related smartphone applications and their receptiveness when using these applications.\n\n Moreover, socio-demographic characteristics and health status were also self-reported.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression was employed to determine associated factors.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Among 1028 participants, 57.4% owned a smartphone and only 14.1% of smartphone users have used a health-related smartphone application, and most of these individuals downloaded the applications for disease prevention (66.3%).\n\n 66.4% of the participants who owned these applications reported that health applications were useful and 92.8% reported being satisfied with the functionalities of the applications which they owned.\n\n Among smartphone users, people who were employed (OR?=?15.46; 95%CI?=?4.93–48.47) were more likely to download mHealth apps.\n\n Meanwhile, youths with higher EQ-5D index had a lower likelihood of downloading healthcare-related smartphone applications (OR?=?0.17; 95%CI?=?0.04–0.81).\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>This study highlighted a low rate of mHealth apps utilization among online Vietnamese youths and adolescents but a high acceptance of individuals who already used these apps.\n\n Developing mHealth apps or interventions towards the disease prevention and quality of life improvement could be feasible to proliferate the benefits of such applications in youths and adolescents in Vietnam.\n\n Further research should be conducted to optimize the contents and interfaces of mHealth apps that meet the needs of these populations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6009816","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Toan Thanh

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the

worded statements, is a validated instrument to measure mental wellbeing on a population level.\n\n Less is known about the population distribution of the shorter seven-item version (SWEMWBS) or its performance as an instrument to measure wellbeing.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing the Health Survey for England 2010–2013 (n = 27,169 adults aged 16+, nationally representative of the population), age- and sex-specific norms were estimated using means and percentiles.\n\n Criterion validity was examined using: (1) Spearman correlations (?) for SWEMWBS with General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), happiness index, EQ-VAS (2) a multinomial logit model with SWEMWBS (low, medium and high wellbeing) as the outcome and demographic, social and health behaviours as explanatory variables.\n\n Relative validity was examined by comparing SWEMWBS with WEMWBS using: (1) Spearman correlations (continuous data), and (2) the weighted kappa statistic (categorical), within population subgroups.\n\n\nResults\nMean (median) SWEMWBS was 23.7 (23.2) for men and 23.2 (23.2) for women (p = 0.100).\n\n Spearman correlations were moderately sized for the happiness index (? = 0.53, P &lt; 0.001), GHQ-12 (? = ?0.52, p &lt; 0.001) and EQ-VAS (? = 0.40, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Participants consuming &lt;1 portion of fruit and vegetables a day versus ?5 (odds ratio = 1.43 95% Confidence Interval = (1.22–1.66)) and current smokers versus non-smokers (1.28 (1.15–1.41)) were more likely to have low vs medium wellbeing.\n\n Participants who binge drank versus non-drinkers were less likely to have high versus medium wellbeing (0.81 (0.71–0.92)).\n\n Spearman correlations between SWEMWBS and WEMWBS were above 0.95; weighted kappa statistics showed almost perfect agreement (0.79–0.85).\n\n\nConclusion\nSWEMWBS distinguishes mental wellbeing between subgroups, similarly to WEMWBS, but is less sensitive to gender differences.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe

UK validation","abstract":"Background\nThere is increasing international interest in the concept of mental well-being and its contribution to all aspects of human life.\n\n Demand for instruments to monitor mental well-being at a population level and evaluate mental health promotion initiatives is growing.\n\n This article describes the development and validation of a new scale, comprised only of positively worded items relating to different aspects of positive mental health: the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS).\n\n\nMethods\nWEMWBS was developed by an expert panel drawing on current academic literature, qualitative research with focus groups, and psychometric testing of an existing scale.\n\n It was validated on a student and representative population sample.\n\n Content validity was assessed by reviewing the frequency of complete responses and the distribution of responses to each item.\n\n Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the hypothesis that the scale measured a single construct.\n\n Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha.\n\n Criterion validity was explored in terms of correlations between WEMWBS and other scales and by testing whether the scale discriminated between population groups in line with pre-specified hypotheses.\n\n Test-retest reliability was assessed at one week using intra-class correlation coefficients.\n\n Susceptibility to bias was measured using the Balanced Inventory of Desired Responding.\n\n\nResults\nWEMWBS showed good content validity.\n\n Confirmatory factor analysis supported the single factor hypothesis.\n\n A Cronbach's alpha score of 0.89 (student sample) and 0.91 (population sample) suggests some item redundancy in the scale.\n\n WEMWBS showed high correlations with other mental health and well-being scales and lower correlations with scales measuring overall health.\n\n Its distribution was near normal and the scale did not show ceiling effects in a population sample.\n\n It discriminated between population groups in a way that is largely consistent with the results of other population surveys.\n\n Test-retest reliability at one week was high (0.83).\n\n Social desirability bias was lower or similar to that of other comparable scales.\n\n\nConclusion\nWEMWBS is a measure of mental well-being focusing entirely on positive aspects of mental health.\n\n As a short and psychometrically robust scale, with no ceiling effects in a population sample, it offers promise as a tool for monitoring mental well-being at a population level.\n\n Whilst WEMWBS should appeal to those evaluating mental health promotion initiatives, it is important that the scale's sensitivity to change is established before it is recommended in this context.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2222612","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ruth","surname":"Tennant","email":"ruthtennant71@hotmail.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Louise","surname":"Hiller","email":"l.hiller@warwick.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruth","surname":"Fishwick","email":"vrf610@bham.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Platt","email":"steve.platt@ed.ac.uk","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Joseph","email":"stephen.joseph@nottingham.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Scott","surname":"Weich","email":"s.weich@warwick.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jane","surname":"Parkinson","email":"jane.parkinson@health.scot.nhs.uk","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jenny","surname":"Secker","email":"jenny@longmead.demon.co.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"Stewart-Brown","email":"sarah.stewart-brown@warwick.ac.uk","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/1477-7525-7-15","date":"2009-02-19","title":"Internal construct validity of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS): a Rasch analysis using data from the Scottish Health Education Population Survey","abstract":"Background\nThe Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) was developed to meet demand for instruments to measure mental well-being.\n\n It comprises 14 positively phrased Likert-style items and fulfils classic criteria for scale development.\n\n We report here the internal construct validity of WEMWBS from the perspective of the Rasch measurement model.\n\n\nMethods\nThe model was applied to data collected from 779 respondents in Wave 12 (Autumn 2006) of the Scottish Health Education Population Survey.\n\n Respondents were aged 16–74 (average 41.9) yrs.\n\n\nResults\nInitial fit to model expectations was poor.\n\n The items 'I've been feeling good about myself', 'I've been interested in new things' and 'I've been feeling cheerful' all showed significant misfit to model expectations, and were deleted.\n\n This led to a marginal improvement in fit to the model.\n\n After further analysis, more items were deleted and a strict unidimensional seven item scale (the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS)) was resolved.\n\n Many items deleted because of misfit with model expectations showed considerable bias for gender.\n\n Two retained items also demonstrated bias for gender but, at the scale level, cancelled out.\n\n One further retained item 'I've been feeling optimistic about the future' showed bias for age.\n\n The correlation between the 14 item and 7 item versions was 0.954.\nConclusion\nA short 7 item version of WEMWBS was found to satisfy the strict unidimensionality expectations of the Rasch model, and be largely free of bias.\n\n This scale, SWEMWBS, provides a raw score-interval scale transformation for use in parametric procedures.\n\n In terms of face validity, SWEMWBS presents a more restricted view of mental well-being than the 14 item WEMWBS, with most items representing aspects of psychological and eudemonic well-being, and few covering hedonic well-being or affect.\n\n However, robust measurement properties combined with brevity make SWEMWBS preferable to WEMWBS at present for monitoring mental well-being in populations.\n\n Where face validity is an issue there remain arguments for continuing to collect data on the full 14 item WEMWBS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2669062","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"Stewart-Brown","email":"Sarah.Stewart-Brown@warwick.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Tennant","email":"a.tennant@leeds.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruth","surname":"Tennant","email":"ruth.tennant@coventrypct.nhs.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Platt","email":"steve.platt@ed.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jane","surname":"Parkinson","email":"jane.parkinson@health.scot.nhs.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Scott","surname":"Weich","email":"s.weich@warwick.ac.uk","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WEMWBS

method to assess physical activity.\n\n Several studies validating the IPAQ-SF have been conducted with differing results, but no systematic review of these studies has been reported.\n\n\nMethods\nThe keywords 'IPAQ', 'validation', and 'validity' were searched in PubMed and Scopus.\n\n Studies published in English that validated the IPAQ-SF against an objective physical activity measuring device, doubly labeled water, or an objective fitness measure were included.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-three validation studies were included in this review.\n\n There was a great deal of variability in the methods used across studies, but the results were largely similar.\n\n Correlations between the total physical activity level measured by the IPAQ-SF and objective standards ranged from 0.09 to 0.39; none reached the minimal acceptable standard in the literature (0.50 for objective activity measuring devices, 0.40 for fitness measures).\n\n Correlations between sections of the IPAQ-SF for vigorous activity or moderate activity level/walking and an objective standard showed even greater variability (-0.18 to 0.76), yet several reached the minimal acceptable

classification of so called 'fluctuating active' versus 'passive' patients.\n\n For successful treatment with CBT is it especially important to recognise the passive patients and give them a tailored treatment protocol.\n\n In the present study it was evaluated whether CFS patient's physical activity pattern can be assessed most accurately with the 'Activity Pattern Interview' (API), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) or the CFS-Activity Questionnaire (CFS-AQ).\n\n\nMethods\nThe three instruments were validated compared to actometers.\n\n Actometers are until now the best and most objective instrument to measure physical activity, but they are too expensive and time consuming for most clinical practice settings.\n\n In total 226 CFS patients enrolled for CBT therapy answered the API at intake and filled in the two questionnaires.\n\n Directly after intake they wore the actometer for two weeks.\n\n Based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves the validity of the three methods were assessed and compared.\n\n\nResults\nBoth the API and the two questionnaires had an acceptable validity (0.64 to 0.71).\n\n None of the three instruments was significantly better than the others.\n\n The proportion of false predictions was rather high for all three instrument.\n\n The IPAQ had the highest proportion of correct passive predictions (sensitivity 70.1%).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe validity of all three instruments appeared to be fair, and all showed rather high proportions of false classifications.\n\n Hence in fact none of the tested instruments could really be called satisfactory.\n\n Because the IPAQ showed to be the best in correctly predicting 'passive' CFS patients, which is most essentially related to treatment results, it was concluded that the IPAQ is the preferable alternative for an actometer when treating CFS patients in clinical practice.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2674446","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Korine","surname":"Scheeres","email":"korinescheeres@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hans","surname":"Knoop","email":"J.Knoop@nkcv.umcn.nl","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"van

epidemiological studies.\n\n We investigated the reliability and validity of two different physical activity questionnaires in 71 adolescents aged 13–18 years; the WHO, Health Behaviour in Schoolchildren (HBSC) questionnaire, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ, short version).\n\n\nMethods\nThe questionnaires were administered twice (8–12 days apart) to measure reliability.\n\n Validity was assessed by comparing answers from the questionnaires with a cardiorespiratory fitness test (VO2peak) and seven days activity monitoring with the ActiReg, an instrument measuring physical activity level (PAL) and total energy expenditure (TEE).\n\n\nResults\nIntraclass correlation coefficients for reliability for the WHO HBSC questionnaire were 0.71 for frequency and 0.73 for duration.\n\n For the frequency question, there was a significant difference between genders; 0.87 for girls and 0.59 for boys (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n The intraclass correlation coefficients the IPAQ varied between 0.10 and 0.62 for the reliability.\n\n Spearman correlation coefficients for validity for both the WHO HBSC questionnaire and the IPAQ (recoded into low, moderate and high activity) measured against VO2peak were fair, ranging between 0.29 – 0.39. The WHO HBSC questionnaire measured against VO2peak for girls were acceptable, ranging between 0.30 – 0.55. Both questionnaires, except the walking question in IPAQ, showed a low correlation with PAL and TEE, ranging between 0.01 and 0.29.\nConclusion\nThese data indicate that the WHO HBSC questionnaire had substantial reliability and were acceptable instrument for measuring cardiorespiratory fitness, especially among girls.\n\n None of the questionnaires however seemed to be a valid instrument for measuring physical activity compared to TEE and PAL in adolescents.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2492874","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Vegar","surname":"Rangul","email":"vegar.rangul@hint.no","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Turid Lingaas","surname":"Holmen","email":"turid.lingaas.holmen@ntnu.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nanna","surname":"Kurtze","email":"nanna.kurtze@sintef.no","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Koenraad","surname":"Cuypers","email":"kjcuype@online.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kristian","surname":"Midthjell","email":"kristian.midthjell@ntnu.no","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Validity and reliability of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire in college students","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/00005768-199805000-00021","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Calibration of the computer science and applications, inc. accelerometer","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/00005768-200009001-00003","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Estimation of energy expenditure using CSA accelerometers at hip and wrist sites","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602805","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Physical activity level in healthy free-living Japanese estimated by doubly labelled water method and International Physical Activity Questionnaire","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Reliability and validity of a computerized and Dutch version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"What do pedometer counts represent?

The work–life balance is especially difficult to achieve for those with partners who continue to work outside the home during the emergency.\n","id":"PMC7474798","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniela","surname":"Del Boca","email":"daniela.delboca@carloalberto.org","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Noemi","surname":"Oggero","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paola","surname":"Profeta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mariacristina","surname":"Rossi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.tranpol.2012.06.005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The role of well-being in transport policy","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2011.04.005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The spatial context of transport disadvantage, social exclusion and well-being","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.32866/001c.13395","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A tale of 40 cities: a preliminary analysis of equity impacts of COVID-19 service adjustments across North America","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Diener, (ed.): Guidelines for National Indicators of Subjective Well-Being and Ill-Being 7(4), 397-404 (2006)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1023/A:1006859511756","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Measuring quality of life: economic, social, and subjective indicators","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Subjective well-being: three decades of progress","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Dong, H., Ma, S., Jia, N., Tian, J.: Understanding public transport satisfaction in post COVID-19 pandemic.

Feature selection was conducted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify predictors from a comprehensive set of variables.\n Selected variables were then entered into an ordinary least squares (OLS) model to compare coefficients and assess statistical significance.\n Results: Six negative predictors of university students’ psychological wellbeing emerged: White/European ethnicity, restriction stress, perceived worry on mental health, dietary changes, perceived sufficiency of distancing communication, and social isolation.\n Physical health status, emotional support, and resilience were positively associated with students’ psychological wellbeing.\n Social isolation has the largest effect on students’ psychological wellbeing.\n Notably, age, gender, international status, and educational level did not emerge as predictors of wellbeing.\n Conclusion: To cost-effectively support student wellbeing through 2021 and beyond, universities should consider investing in internet- and tele- based interventions explicitly targeting perceived social isolation among students.\n Course-based online forums as well as internet- and tele-based logotherapy may be promising candidates for improving students’ psychological wellbeing.\n","id":"PMC8296899","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Melinda","surname":"McCabe","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Melinda","surname":"McCabe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Dawson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chad","surname":"Cyrzon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shruthi","surname":"Shankar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nardin","surname":"Gerges","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Kellett-Renzella","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yann","surname":"Chye","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kim","surname":"Cornish","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maurizio","surname":"Pompili","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Maurizio","surname":"Pompili","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrea","surname":"Fiorillo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2021.103176","date":"2021-08-22","title":"Elderly mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative exploration in Kunming, China","abstract":"The outbreak of COVID-19 in China started at the end of December 2019.

systematic review","abstract":"In modern societies, the understanding of how active mobility affects the elderly's psycho-physical well-being is crucial to design ageing-friendly transport measures.\n From a multidisciplinary perspective, this systematic review points out the mobility impact on three elements of the EU Active Ageing Index: health, independence and social connectedness.\n By scanning four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and TRID), 3727 peer-reviewed papers published in the last decade were found, of which 57 met the inclusion criteria.\n The screening process was conducted following the PRISMA protocol and registered to the database PROSPERO, while the quality assessment was done using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.\n More than 80% of the papers showed that an active mobility prevents psycho-physical harms, while only few papers study the relation of mobility with independence and social inclusion, to reduce the need for assistance and the related public expenditures.\n The findings of this review give important information both to transportation researchers and policymakers and companies, underlining the need for further research as well as investments in targeted age-friendly transport systems.\n The Covid-19 emergency has further underlined the importance of this issue, being the elderly one of the more disadvantaged and frailer social

surveys and demographic data","abstract":"Heterogeneities in contact networks have a major effect in determining whether a pathogen can become epidemic or persist at endemic levels.\n Epidemic models that determine which interventions can successfully prevent an outbreak need to account for social structure and mixing patterns.\n Contact patterns vary across age and locations (e.\ng.\n home, work, and school), and including them as predictors in transmission dynamic models of pathogens that spread socially will improve the models’ realism.\n Data from population-based contact diaries in eight European countries from the POLYMOD study were projected to 144 other countries using a Bayesian hierarchical model that estimated the proclivity of age-and-location-specific contact patterns for the countries, using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.\n Household level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys for nine lower-income countries and socio-demographic factors from several on-line databases for 152 countries were used to quantify similarity of countries to estimate contact patterns in the home, work, school and other locations for countries for which no contact data are available, accounting for demographic structure, household structure where known, and a variety of metrics including workforce participation and school enrolment.\n Contacts are highly assortative with age across all countries considered, but pronounced regional differences in the age-specific contacts at home were noticeable, with more inter-generational contacts in Asian countries than in other settings.\n Moreover, there were variations in contact patterns by location, with work-place contacts being least assortative.\n These variations led to differences in the effect of social distancing measures in an age structured epidemic model.\n Contacts have an important role in transmission dynamic models that use contact rates to characterize the spread of contact-transmissible diseases.\n This study provides estimates of mixing patterns for societies for which contact data such as POLYMOD are not yet

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2013.06.008","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Mode choice of university students commuting to school and the role of active travel","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"White, R.G., Van Der B.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.09.20021477","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The lockdown of Hubei Province causing different transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan and Beijing","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Moodie Davitt Report, 2020.

public health emergency.\n To slow the spread of the coronavirus, countries around the world have been implementing various measures, including school and institutional closures, lockdown and targeted quarantine for suspected infected individuals.\n More than a third of the world’s population have been home confined less than 4 months after the start of the outbreak.\n The present article aims to advise healthy individuals and athletes who are in lockdown regarding their lifestyle in order to keep healthy, safe and fit.\n The advice contained in the present article could apply to anyone aiming at remaining in good physical and mental health while forced to undergo lockdown, quarantine, or limited movement (movement control order).\n Boosting the immune system is crucial during such periods for confined people and especially for confined athletes.\n Specific recommendations must be followed concerning boosting the immune system through physiological and psychological management.\n This article analyses the available scientific evidence in order to recommend a practical approach, focusing on nutrition, intermittent fasting or caloric restriction, vitamin D insufficiency, sleep

health concern.\n Characterized by rapid and high frequency human-to-human transmission, the World Health Organization has recommended implementation of public health measures, including isolation of all suspected infectious individuals for a 14-day quarantine period, while governments have introduced “social distancing” and “lock-downs” of varying severity to curtail COVID-19 spread.\n Recent COVID-19 research further suggests there are major sleep problems and psychological disorders (e.\ng.\n, stress, anxiety, depression) associated with the reduction of movement and activities, as well as the reduced social interaction.\n There have been no studies examining the effect of physical activity at home during such periods of isolation.\n However, based on previous research, potential tactics to overcome these negative effects include home-based exercise, exergaming, dancing to music, and participation in yoga.\n Adults should accumulate at least 150 min of moderate-intensity and at least 75 min of vigorous-intensity of activity divided in to 5–7 sessions per week.\n This training volume could be reduced by 30% for children and adolescents if replaced by recess or active play in and around the home.\n Additionally, exercises should be adapted to the fitness level of the participant and a progressive model of intensity and training volume should be utilized, preferably monitored by telephone applications and wearable sensors.\n","id":"PMC7466737","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hamdi","surname":"Chtourou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Khaled","surname":"Trabelsi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrine","surname":"H'mida","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Boukhris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jordan

restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined.\n Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions.\n This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours.\n Methods: Following a structured review of the literature, the “Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19)” Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics.\n The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform.\n Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages.\n Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses “before” and “during” confinement conditions.\n Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis.\n The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall).\n Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day.\n Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly.\n Conclusion: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction.\n A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.\n","id":"PMC7352706","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Achraf","surname":"Ammar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Khaled","surname":"Trabelsi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamdi","surname":"Chtourou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Boukhris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liwa","surname":"Masmoudi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bassem","surname":"Bouaziz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ellen","surname":"Bentlage","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniella","surname":"How","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Notger","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Asma","surname":"Aloui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Hammouda","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laisa

of the international physical activity questionnaire short form (IPAQ-SF): A systematic review","abstract":"Background\nThe International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF) has been recommended as a cost-effective method to assess physical activity.\n\n Several studies validating the IPAQ-SF have been conducted with differing results, but no systematic review of these studies has been reported.\n\n\nMethods\nThe keywords 'IPAQ', 'validation', and 'validity' were searched in PubMed and Scopus.\n\n Studies published in English that validated the IPAQ-SF against an objective physical activity measuring device, doubly labeled water, or an objective fitness measure were included.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-three validation studies were included in this review.\n\n There was a great deal of variability in the methods used across studies, but the results were largely similar.\n\n Correlations between the total physical activity level measured by the IPAQ-SF and objective standards ranged from 0.09 to 0.39; none reached the minimal acceptable standard in the literature (0.50 for objective activity measuring devices, 0.40 for fitness measures).\n\n Correlations between sections of the IPAQ-SF for vigorous activity or moderate activity level/walking and an objective standard showed even greater variability (-0.18 to 0.76), yet several reached the minimal acceptable standard.\n\n Only six studies provided comparisons between physical activity levels derived from the IPAQ-SF and those obtained from objective criterion.\n\n In most studies the IPAQ-SF overestimated physical activity level by 36 to 173 percent; one study underestimated by 28 percent.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe correlation between the IPAQ-SF and objective measures of activity or fitness in the large majority of studies was lower than the acceptable standard.\n\n Furthermore, the IPAQ-SF typically overestimated physical activity as measured by objective criterion by an average of 84 percent.\n\n Hence, the evidence to support the use of the IPAQ-SF as an indicator of relative or absolute physical activity is weak.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3214824","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paul H","surname":"Lee","email":"paulhlee@hku.hk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Duncan

Feb.\n\n 2020.\nMaterial/Methods\nData were collected using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) administered to 1593 respondents aged 18 years and above.\n\n The respondents were grouped as ‘affected group’ and ‘unaffected group’ on the basis of whether they or their families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9%, 22.4%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7%, 11.9%).\n\n Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS.\n\n People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than in the unaffected group during the COVID-19

naïve, uninfected population.\n It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period.\n With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate.\n Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised.\n By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th, 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions.\n We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak.\n Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation.\n The

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience.\n Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic.\n The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n The data will be used for future reference.\n Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques.\n The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt;

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong,

were screened by two researchers.\n Thirty-one relevant studies were included in this systematic review, in which the methodological quality was assessed.\n With regard to six studies, which explicitly dealt with physical activity during COVID-19, the evidence level is classified by three articles to level II, and in the other three to level VI.\n Regarding the physical activity recommendations in these papers, three of them were classified to a medium, and the same number to a weak evidence base.\n Of the 25 papers which refer to other pandemics and/or isolation situations, one was classified to evidence level I, four were ranged to level II, three to level III, one to level V, and the others to level VI.\n This systematic review revealed that reduced physical activity levels are of serious concern during home confinement in pandemic times.\n The recommendations provided by many international organizations to maintain active lifestyles during these times mainly target the general population, with less consideration for vulnerable populations (e.\ng.\n, older adults, people with health issues).\n Therefore, personalized and supervised physical activity programs are urgently needed, with the option to group-play physical activity programs (e.\ng.\n, exergames).\n These can be assisted, delivered, and disseminated worldwide through information and communication technology solutions.\n If it is permitted and safe, being active outside in daylight is advised, with an effort level of mild to moderate using the rating of perceived exertion scale.\n Relaxation techniques should be integrated into the daily routine to reduce stress levels.\n On the evidence base and levels of the included articles in this review, the results need to be interpreted with caution.\n Given that policies are different across regions and countries, further research is needed to categorize recommendations according to different social-distancing scenarios.\n","id":"PMC7503956","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ellen","surname":"Bentlage","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Achraf","surname":"Ammar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Achraf","surname":"Ammar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniella","surname":"How","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniella","surname":"How","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Khaled","surname":"Trabelsi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamdi","surname":"Chtourou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamdi","surname":"Chtourou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

a cross-sectional study","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Sedentary behaviour has become a growing public health concern.\n\n Currently, it is a common belief that screen time (SCT) is a key factor in high overall sedentary time (ST) and is often used as a primary outcome.\n\n However, the evidence is lacking.\n\n Therefore, this study investigated the association of objectively assessed total ST with SCT among children.\n\n Further, SCT was investigated separately for sedentary level, weight status, gender, and migration background.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>For 198 primary school children (7.1?±?0.7?years, boys: 43.9%) ST was assessed objectively using a multi-sensor device (Actiheart®; CamNtech, Cambridge, UK).\n\n The sample was split into three groups (tertiles) to investigate SCT of children with low, medium and high ST.\n\n SCT and socio-demographic parameters, such as migration background, were assessed using a parental questionnaire; anthropometric data was collected at schools.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Absolut SCT did not differ significantly among the three sedentary groups: Daily average of SCT was 83.8?±?55.0?min (27.4% of ST) for children with high ST, 82.8?±?50.5?min (39.8% of ST) for children with medium ST, and 77.2?±?59.4?min (71.3% of ST) for those with low ST.\n\n However, relatively the SCT percentage of total ST was significantly higher among children with low ST (p?&lt;?0.01).\n\n Significantly higher SCT was found in children with migration background (p?&lt;?0.01), while underweight children had significantly less SCT (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n An association of total SCT and overall ST was found for the whole sample (B?=?17.11, [2.75; 31.48], p?=?0.02), but did not remain when analysis were separated for the groups, except for normal weight children (B?=?15.97, [0.13; 31.81], p?=?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>The amount of SCT is the same among high, low and medium sedentary children, and high ST is largely independent of SCT.\n\n Therefore, SCT cannot be the key contributor to high ST and should not solely be used for predicting or changing children’s sedentary behaviour.\n\n Moreover, children’s weight status to classify activity levels and the role of possible compensation mechanisms should be considered in future research and when trying to intervene on ST.\n\n\nTrial

reducing sedentary time may be dependent not only on decrease per se, but also on the type of activity it replaces.\n\n Few longitudinal studies have investigated the effects on mortality when replacing objectively assessed sedentary time with another physical activity (PA) behavior.\n\n\nObjective\nTo investigate the effects of replacing objectively assessed sedentary time with time in light-intensity PA or moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA) on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality or cancer mortality in a cohort with 15 years follow-up time.\n\n\nMethods\nIn total, 851 women and men from the population-based Sweden Attitude Behaviour and Change study were included.\n\n Time spent sedentary, in light-intensity PA and in MVPA were assessed using an Actigraph 7164 accelerometer.\n\n Mortality data were obtained from Swedish registers.\n\n Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HR) of mortality with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and isotemporal substitution models were used to estimate the effect of replacing sedentary behavior with PA for the same amount of time.\n\n\nResults\nOver a follow-up of 14.2 years (SD 1.9) with 12,117 person-years at risk, 79 deaths occurred, 24 deaths from CVD, 27 from cancer, and 28 from other causes.\n\n Replacing 30 minutes/day of sedentary time with light-intensity PA was associated with significant reduction in all-cause mortality risk (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81–0.98) and CVD mortality risk (HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63–0.92).\n\n Replacing 10 minutes of sedentary time with MVPA was associated with reduction in CVD mortality risk (HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.42–0.91).\n\n No statistically significant reductions were found for cancer mortality.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis statistical modelling study suggests that replacing sedentary time with light-intensity PA could have beneficial effect on both all-cause mortality and CVD mortality.\n\n Replacing sedentary time with MVPA could reduce CVD mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5790069","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ing-Mari","surname":"Dohrn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lydia","surname":"Kwak","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pekka","surname":"Oja","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Sjöström","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Hagströmer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Physical

Confinement on Eating Behaviour and Physical Activity: Results of the ECLB-COVID19 International Online Survey","abstract":"Background: Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home confinement.\n While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined.\n Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions.\n This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours.\n Methods: Following a structured review of the literature, the “Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19)” Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics.\n The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform.\n Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages.\n Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses “before” and “during” confinement conditions.\n Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis.\n The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall).\n Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day.\n Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly.\n Conclusion: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction.\n A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19

created an unprecedented worldwide public health concern.\n Characterized by rapid and high frequency human-to-human transmission, the World Health Organization has recommended implementation of public health measures, including isolation of all suspected infectious individuals for a 14-day quarantine period, while governments have introduced “social distancing” and “lock-downs” of varying severity to curtail COVID-19 spread.\n Recent COVID-19 research further suggests there are major sleep problems and psychological disorders (e.\ng.\n, stress, anxiety, depression) associated with the reduction of movement and activities, as well as the reduced social interaction.\n There have been no studies examining the effect of physical activity at home during such periods of isolation.\n However, based on previous research, potential tactics to overcome these negative effects include home-based exercise, exergaming, dancing to music, and participation in yoga.\n Adults should accumulate at least 150 min of moderate-intensity and at least 75 min of vigorous-intensity of activity divided in to 5–7 sessions per week.\n This training volume could be reduced by 30% for children and adolescents if replaced by recess or active play in and around the home.\n Additionally, exercises should be adapted to the fitness level of the participant and a progressive model of intensity

France: A narrative review","abstract":"Objective\nThe lack of resources and coordination to face the coronavirus epidemic raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we still have memories of the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War.\n\n This article aims to propose guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemic in France.\n\n\nMethods\nThe authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and in local initiatives in France.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.\n\n) which are risk factors for severe covid-19 infection; (2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties.\n\n Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems.\n\n Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources.\n\n In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases.\n\n There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units.\n\n To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of “COVID+ units”.\n\n These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical check-ups and close psychological support.\n\n Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference.\n\n At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders.\n\n The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho-education strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context.\n\n Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc.\n\n They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.\n\n\nDiscussion\nFrench mental healthcare is now facing a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the confinement of the general population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7174154","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"A.","surname":"Chevance","email":"astrid.chevance@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.","surname":"Gourion","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"N.","surname":"Hoertel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.-M.","surname":"Llorca","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Thomas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R.","surname":"Bocher","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.-R.","surname":"Moro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"V.","surname":"Laprévote","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.","surname":"Benyamina","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Fossati","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Masson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"E.","surname":"Leaune","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Leboyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R.","surname":"Gaillard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00592-020-01522-8","date":"2020-03-18","title":"Influenza

inform guidelines and intervention.\n\n There is a dearth of information about when, where to intervene and which specific behaviours intervention should target.\n\n The aim of this exploratory study was to obtain objective information about what older adults do when sedentary, where and when they are sedentary and in what social context.\n\n\nMethods\nThe study was a cross-sectional data collection.\n\n Older adults (Mean age = 73.25, SD ± 5.48, median = 72, IQR = 11) volunteers wore activPAL monitors and a Vicon Revue timelapse camera between 1 and 7 days.\n\n Periods of sedentary

Spaceflight!","abstract":"This paper provides a general overview of key physiological consequences of microgravity experienced during spaceflight and of important parallels and connections to the physiology of aging.\n Microgravity during spaceflight influences cardiovascular function, cerebral autoregulation, musculoskeletal, and sensorimotor system performance.\n A great deal of research has been carried out to understand these influences and to provide countermeasures to reduce the observed negative consequences of microgravity on physiological function.\n Such research can inform and be informed by research related to physiological changes and the deterioration of physiological function due to aging.\n For example, head-down bedrest is used as a model to study effects of spaceflight deconditioning due to reduced gravity.\n As hospitalized older persons spend up to 80% of their time in bed, the deconditioning effects of bedrest confinement on physiological functions and parallels with spaceflight deconditioning can be exploited to understand and combat both variations of deconditioning.\n Deconditioning due to bed confinement in older persons can contribute to a downward spiral of increasing frailty, orthostatic intolerance, falls, and fall-related injury.\n As astronauts in space spend substantial amounts of time carrying out exercise training to counteract the microgravity-induced deconditioning and to counteract orthostatic intolerance on return to Earth, it is logical to suggest some of these interventions for bed-confined older persons.\n Synthesizing knowledge regarding deconditioning due to reduced gravitational stress in space and deconditioning during bed confinement allows for a more comprehensive approach that can incorporate aspects such as (mal-) nutrition, muscle strength and function, cardiovascular (de-) conditioning, and cardio-postural interactions.\n The impact of such integration can provide new insights and lead to methods of value for both space medicine and geriatrics (Geriatrics meets spaceflight!).\n In particular, such integration can lead to procedures that address the morbidity and the mortality associated with bedrest immobilization and in the rising health care costs associated with an aging population demographic.\n","id":"PMC5641583","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nandu","surname":"Goswami","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1249/01.MSS.0000384910.14174.98","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Exercise

the intervention.\n This was attributed to improvements in self-esteem, social interaction and mental wellbeing.\n Participants generally felt that their physical activity had increased since attending Street Fit Scotland, and a number of individuals reported that they were making healthier choices with regards to health behaviors.\n A theory of change logic model was developed that demonstrated how each component of the intervention influences the observed and intended outcomes.\n Attendance of Street Fit Scotland had positive effects on participant's health and wellbeing,

interaction and slow the transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\n\n For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships.\n\n As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns.\n\n\nObjective\nThis project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing.\n\n First, we will evaluate the tool’s feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing.\n\n Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting.\n\n Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems.\n\n\nMethods\nDevelopment of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress.\n\n The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods.\n\n The evaluation of the app’s feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura’s model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework.\n\n\nResults\nMaking use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created.\n\n Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun.\n\n Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures.\n\n The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app.\n\n This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation

adults: a systematic review","abstract":"Background\nThe promotion of active and healthy ageing is becoming increasingly important as the population ages.\n\n Physical activity (PA) significantly reduces all-cause mortality and contributes to the prevention of many chronic illnesses.\n\n However, the proportion of people globally who are active enough to gain these health benefits is low and decreases with age.\n\n Social support (SS) is a social determinant of health that may improve PA in older adults, but the association has not been systematically reviewed.\n\n\nMethods\nQuantitative studies examining a relationship between SS, or loneliness, and PA levels in healthy, older adults over 60 were identified using MEDLINE, PSYCInfo, SportDiscus, CINAHL and PubMed, and through reference lists of included studies.\n\n Quality of these studies was rated.\n\n\nResults\nThis review included 27 papers, of which 22 were cross sectional studies, three were prospective/longitudinal and two were intervention studies.\n\n Overall, the study quality was moderate.\n\n Four articles examined the relation of PA with general SS, 17 with SS specific to PA (SSPA), and six with loneliness.\n\n The results suggest that there is a positive association between SSPA and PA levels in older adults, especially when it comes from family members.\n\n No clear associations were identified between general SS, SSPA from friends, or loneliness and PA levels.\n\n When measured separately, leisure time PA (LTPA) was associated with SS in a greater percentage of studies than when a number of PA domains were measured together.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe evidence surrounding the relationship between SS, or loneliness, and PA in older adults suggests that people with greater SS for PA are more likely to do LTPA, especially when the SS comes from family members.\n\n However, high variability in measurement methods used to assess both SS and PA in included studies made it difficult

an increased risk of falls.\n Previous studies demonstrated that falls prevention programs are effective, but they suffer from low adherence, especially when subjects have to train unsupervised in

practice.\n In the context of smart homes, this work presents SocialBike, a virtual reality-based application aimed at improving the clinical outcomes of older frail adults in their houses.\n Indeed, SocialBike is integrated in the “house of the future” framework and proposes a Dual Task training program in which the users are required to cycle on a stationary bike while recognizing target animals or objects appearing along the way.\n It also implements the possibility of training with other users, thus reducing the risk of social isolation.\n Within SocialBike, users can choose the multiplayer mode they prefer (i.\ne.\n, collaborative or competitive), and are allowed to train following their own attitude.\n SocialBike’s validation, refinement, and business model are currently under

have been insufficiently investigated.\n\n Appropriate countermeasures are required, such as exercise, which is known to prevent mood disorders for prolonged space and isolation missions.\n\n Based on the interaction of brain activity, mood and cognitive performance, this study aims to investigate the effect of long-term isolation and confinement and the long-term effect of exercise on these parameters.\n\n\nMethods\nEight male volunteers were isolated and confined for about eight month during the winter period at the Antarctic Concordia Station.\n\n Every six weeks electroencephalographic measurements were recorded under rest conditions, and cognitive tests and a mood questionnaire were executed.\n\n Based individual training logs, subjects were afterwards separated into an active (&gt; 2500 arbitrary training units/interval) or inactive (&lt; 2500 arbitrary training units/interval) group.\n\n\nResults\nA long-term effect of exercise was observed for brain activity and mood.\n\n Regularly active people showed a decreased brain activity (alpha and beta) in the course of isolation, and steady mood.\n\n Inactive people instead first increased and than remained at high brain activity accompanied with a deterioration of mood.\n\n No effect of exercise and isolation was found for cognitive performance.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe findings point out the positive effect of regularly performed voluntary exercise, supporting subjective mental well-being of long-term isolated people.\n\n The choice to be regularly active seems to support mental health,

largest and the only sustaining effect on adult neuroplasticity.\n Dancing has been suggested as a human homologue to this combined intervention as it poses demands on both physical and cognitive functions.\n For the present exploratory study, we designed an especially challenging dance program in which our elderly participants constantly had to learn novel and increasingly difficult choreographies.\n This six-month-long program was compared to conventional fitness training matched for intensity.\n An extensive pre/post-assessment was performed on the 38 participants (63–80 y), covering general cognition, attention, memory, postural and cardio-respiratory performance, neurotrophic factors and–most crucially–structural MRI using an exploratory analysis.\n For analysis of MRI data, a new method of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) designed specifically for pairwise longitudinal group comparisons was employed.\n Both interventions increased physical fitness to the same extent.\n Pronounced differences were seen in the effects on brain volumes: Dancing compared to conventional fitness activity led to larger volume increases in more brain areas, including the cingulate cortex, insula, corpus callosum and sensorimotor cortex.\n Only dancing was associated with an increase in plasma BDNF levels.\n Regarding cognition, both groups improved in attention and spatial memory, but no significant group differences emerged.\n The latter finding may indicate that cognitive benefits may develop later and after structural brain changes have taken place.\n The

considered an activity that involves coordinating movements with music, as well as brain activation because it is constantly necessary to learn and remember new steps.\n Dance as a musical-kinetics skill, requires the coordination of body movements with rhythmic stimuli, developing the adaptability of the movement.\n One-hundred-thirty (130) elderly people aged 60 years and over (mean age 67 years old) with an average of 8 years of education, attended Greek traditional dance sessions for 32 weeks.\n The frequency was 2 times per week, for 75 min per session.\n Dances were selected from all over Greece with moderate intensity initially.\n During the program, they had the opportunity to try with greater intensity dances.\n At the beginning and after the end of intervention all the participants were evaluated by the Fullerton Senior Fitness Test for their physical fitness, the Single Leg Balance and the Handgrip Strength Test.\n The results showed a significant improvement in their physical fitness (Chair Stand: T = ?5.459, p &lt; 0.001; Arm Curl: T = ?5.750, p &lt; 0.001; Back Scratch: T = ?4.648, p &lt; 0.001; Sit and Reach: T = ?4.759, p &lt; 0.001; 2 min Step: T =

nutrition","abstract":"?-Lactalbumin is a whey protein that constitutes approximately 22% of the proteins in human milk and approximately 3.5% of those in bovine milk.\n Within the mammary gland, ?-lactalbumin plays a central role in milk production as part of the lactose synthase complex required for lactose formation, which drives milk volume.\n It is an important source of bioactive peptides and essential amino acids, including tryptophan, lysine, branched-chain amino acids, and sulfur-containing amino acids, all of which are crucial for infant nutrition.\n ?-Lactalbumin contributes to infant development, and the commercial availability of ?-lactalbumin allows infant formulas to be reformulated to have a reduced protein content.\n Likewise, because of its physical characteristics, which include water solubility and heat stability, ?-lactalbumin has the potential to be added to food products as a supplemental protein.\n It also has potential as a nutritional supplement to support neurological function and sleep in adults, owing to its unique tryptophan content.\n Other components of ?-lactalbumin that may have usefulness in nutritional supplements include the branched-chain amino acid leucine, which promotes protein accretion in skeletal muscle, and bioactive peptides, which possess prebiotic and antibacterial properties.\n This review describes the characteristics of ?-lactalbumin and examines the potential applications of ?-lactalbumin for human health.\n","id":"PMC5934683","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Donald

trials have been conducted on multivitamins, to our knowledge no qualitative research exploring the subjective experience of taking a multivitamin during a clinical trial has been reported.\n\n\nMethods\nSemi-structured and open-ended written questions were incorporated into a 16-week double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel groups trial of once-daily multivitamin administration.\n\n At the final study visit (week 16), three open-ended questions were posed to elucidate any positive, negative or unusual experiences from taking either the multivitamin or matched placebo.\n\n Qualitative thematic analysis was undertaken by researchers who were blind as to treatment condition of participants, and triangulation (independent analysis from three researchers) was employed to ensure methodological rigour.\n\n Participant’s experiences were categorised as “positive” or “negative” and a Chi Square analysis was then applied to each of the experiential themes, to compare experiences between the multivitamin and placebo groups, (subdividing the groups by gender).\n\n Usual experiences were categorised and discussed separately.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 182 participants enrolled, 116 completed the study and qualitative data were available from 114 participants.\n\n Thematic analysis revealed significant effects in favour of the multivitamin over placebo for participants experiencing increased energy levels (p=.\n\n022) and enhanced mood (p=.\n\n027).\n\n The beneficial effect on energy levels was particularly evident among female participants.\n\n A trend was found for participants reporting better sleep in the multivitamin over placebo.\n\n The multivitamin and placebo groups did not significantly differ in perceived positive or negative effects in areas relating to other aspects of mental function or physical health.\n\n No significant negative effects were revealed, although there was a non-significant trend for more people in the multivitamin group having minor digestive complaints.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis represents the first documented qualitative investigation of participants’ experience of chronic administration of a multivitamin.\n\n Results uncovered a range of subjective beneficial effects that are consistent with quantitative data from previously published randomised controlled trials examining the effects of multivitamins and B vitamin complexes on mood and well-being.\n\n\nTrial registration\nPrior to commencement this trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry

prescription sleep aids available.\n\n Certain herbal preparations have been suggested to provide a natural benefit to sleep; however, limited controlled data are available documenting this benefit.\n\n In the present study we tested the effect of an experimental dietary supplement, containing the active ingredients Chlorophytum borivilianum and Velvet bean, on sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).\n\n\nMethods\nEighteen healthy and active men and women, with evidence of impaired sleep quality, consumed the supplement daily for 28 days.\n\n The PSQI was administered before and after the intervention period.\n\n As indicators of safety, resting heart rate and blood pressure were measured, and a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and lipid panel were determined.\n\n\nResults\nSleep quality was influenced by the supplement, as evidenced by an improvement in every category of the PSQI questionnaire (P &lt; 0.05), with most category scores improving approximately 50% from pre to post intervention.\n\n No adverse outcomes were noted with use of the supplement, as indicated by no change in resting heart rate, blood pressure, or any bloodborne parameter.\n\n\nConclusions\nAn investigational dietary supplement containing the active ingredients Chlorophytum borivilianum and Velvet bean improves sleep quality in men and women.\n\n Additional placebo controlled trials are needed to corroborate these findings in individuals with self-reported sleeping

success of weight-loss therapy in treating obesity.\n Thus, this study aims to evaluate food and alcohol cravings, physical and sexual activity, sleep, and life quality (QoL) in obese patients following a very low-calorie ketogenic (VLCK) diet, as well as the role of weight lost and ketosis on these parameters.\n A battery of psychological test was performed in twenty obese patients (12 females, 47.2 ± 10.2 year and BMI of 35.5 ± 4.4) through the course of a 4-month VLCK diet on four subsequent visits: baseline, maximum ketosis, reduced ketosis, and endpoint.\n Each subject acted as their own control.\n Relevantly, the dietary-induced changes in body composition (7.7 units of BMI lost, 18 kg of fat mass (1.2 kg of visceral fat mass)) were associated with a statistically significant improvement in food craving scores, physical activity, sleepiness, and female sexual function.\n Overall, these results also translated in a notable enhancement in QoL of the treated obese patients.\n Therefore, the rapid and sustained weight and fat mass (FM) loss induced by the VLCK diet is associated with good food control and improvements in the psychological well-being parameters in obese subjects, which could contribute to the long-term success of this therapy.\n","id":"PMC6213862","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ana

of brain serotonin, details are provided on the research uses of L-tryptophan, particularly L-tryptophan depletion, and on clinical trials that have been conducted using L-tryptophan supplementation.\n The ability to change the rates of serotonin synthesis in the brain by manipulating concentrations of serum tryptophan is the foundation of much research.\n As the sole precursor of serotonin, experimental research has shown that L-tryptophan’s role in brain serotonin synthesis is an important factor involved in mood, behavior, and cognition.\n Furthermore, clinical trials have provided some initial evidence of L-tryptophan’s efficacy for treatment of psychiatric disorders, particularly when used in combination with other therapeutic

entrained by light/dark cycles, whereas peripheral clocks regulating local metabolic rhythms are determined by feeding/fasting cycles.\n Nutrients reset peripheral circadian clocks and the local clock genes control downstream metabolic processes.\n Metabolic states also affect the clockworks in feedback manners.\n Because the circadian system organizes whole energy homeostasis, including food intake, fat accumulation, and caloric expenditure, the disruption of circadian clocks leads to metabolic disorders.\n Recent findings show that time-restricted feeding during the active phase amplifies circadian clocks and improves metabolic disorders induced by a high-fat diet without caloric reduction, whereas unusual/irregular food intake induces various metabolic dysfunctions.\n Such evidence from nutrition studies that consider circadian system (chrononutrition) has rapidly accumulated.\n We review molecular relationships between circadian clocks and nutrition as well as recent chrononutrition

widely identified and qualified in various foods from fungi to animals and plants.\n Eggs and fish are higher melatonin-containing food groups in animal foods, whereas in plant foods, nuts are with the highest content of melatonin.\n Some kinds of mushrooms, cereals and germinated legumes or seeds are also good dietary sources of melatonin.\n It has been proved that the melatonin concentration in human serum could significantly increase after the consumption of melatonin containing food.\n Furthermore, studies show that melatonin exhibits many bioactivities, such as antioxidant activity,

Capacities and Total Phenolic Contents of 56 Wild Fruits from South China","abstract":"In order to identify wild fruits possessing high nutraceutical potential, the antioxidant activities of 56 wild fruits from South China were systematically evaluated.\n The fat-soluble components were extracted with tetrahydrofuran, and the water-soluble ones were extracted with a 50:3.7:46.3 (v/v) methanol-acetic acid-water mixture.\n The antioxidant capacities of the extracts were evaluated using the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays, and their total phenolic contents were measured by the Folin–Ciocalteu method.\n Most of these wild fruits were analyzed for the first time for their antioxidant activities.\n Generally, these fruits had high antioxidant capacities and total phenolic contents.\n A significant correlation between the FRAP value and the TEAC value suggested that antioxidant components in these wild fruits were capable of reducing oxidants and scavenging free radicals.\n A high correlation between antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content indicated that phenolic compounds could be the main contributors to the measured antioxidant activity.\n The results showed that fruits of Eucalyptus robusta, Eurya nitida, Melastoma sanguineum, Melaleuca leucadendron, Lagerstroemia indica, Caryota

inhibits aromatase activity and expression.\n\n Our objective was to study the promoters through which melatonin modifies aromatase expression, evaluate the ability of melatonin to regulate cyclooxygenases and assess whether the effects of melatonin are related to its effects on intracellular cAMP, in MCF-7 cells.\n\n\nMethods:\nTotal aromatase mRNA, aromatase mRNA promoter regions and cyclooxygenases mRNA expression were determined by real-time RT–PCR.\n\n PGE2 and cAMP were measured by kits.\n\n\nResults:\nMelatonin downregulated the gene expression of the two major specific aromatase promoter regions, pII and pI.\n\n3, and also that of the aromatase promoter region pI.\n\n4. Melatonin 1?nM was able to counteract the stimulatory effect of tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate on PGE2 production and inhibit COX-2 and COX-1 mRNA expression.\n\n Melatonin 1?nM elicited a parallel time-dependent decrease in both cyclic AMP formation and aromatase mRNA expression.\n\n\nConclusions:\nThis study shows that melatonin inhibits aromatase activity and expression by regulating the gene expression of specific aromatase promoter regions.\n\n A possible mechanism for these effects would be the regulation by melatonin of intracellular cAMP levels, mediated by an inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity and expression.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2778514","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"C","surname":"Martínez-Campa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A","surname":"González","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M

COX-2/iNOS and NF-?B/p300 Signaling Pathways","abstract":"Melatonin is a hormone identified in plants and pineal glands of mammals and possesses diverse physiological functions.\n Fisetin is a bio-flavonoid widely found in plants and exerts antitumor activity in several types of human cancers.\n However, the combinational effect of melatonin and fisetin on antitumor activity, especially in melanoma treatment, remains unclear.\n Here, we tested the hypothesis that melatonin could enhance the antitumor activity of fisetin in melanoma cells and identified the underlying molecular mechanisms.\n The combinational treatment of melanoma cells with fisetin and melatonin significantly enhanced the inhibitions of cell viability, cell migration and clone formation, and the induction of apoptosis when compared with the treatment of fisetin alone.\n Moreover, such enhancement of antitumor effect by melatonin was found to be mediated through the modulation of the multiply signaling pathways in melanoma cells.\n The combinational treatment of fisetin with melatonin increased the cleavage of PARP proteins, triggered more release of cytochrome-c from the mitochondrial inter-membrane, enhanced the inhibition of COX-2 and iNOS expression, repressed the nuclear localization of p300 and NF-?B proteins, and abrogated the binding of NF-?B on COX-2 promoter.\n Thus, these results demonstrated that melatonin potentiated the anti-tumor effect of fisetin in melanoma cells by activating cytochrome-c-dependent apoptotic pathway and inhibiting COX-2/iNOS and NF-?B/p300 signaling pathways, and our study suggests the potential of such a combinational treatment of natural products in melanoma therapy.\n","id":"PMC4085069","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Canhui","surname":"Yi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenlong","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yao","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jingshu","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huijuan","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wendan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ranran","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuhui","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wuguo","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chunhong","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chunhong","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Melatonin

competent cells acts as a paracrine or autocrine mediator.\n The well-known immunomodulatory effect of melatonin is observed either as an endocrine, a paracrine or an autocrine response.\n In mammals, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor ?-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-?B) blocks noradrenaline-induced melatonin synthesis in pinealocytes, which induces melatonin synthesis in macrophages.\n In addition, melatonin reduces NF-?B activation in pinealocytes and immune competent cells.\n Therefore, pathogen- or danger-associated molecular patterns transiently switch the synthesis of melatonin from pinealocytes to immune competent cells, and as the response progresses melatonin inhibition of NF-?B activity leads these cells to a more quiescent state.\n The opposite effect of NF-?B in pinealocytes and immune competent cells is due to different NF-?B dimers recruited in each phase of the defense response.\n This coordinated shift of the source of melatonin driven by NF-?B is called the immune-pineal axis.\n Finally, we discuss how this concept might be relevant to a better understanding of pathological conditions with impaired melatonin rhythms and hope it opens new horizons for the research of side effects of melatonin-based therapies.\n","id":"PMC3709713","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Regina

Melatonin dysfunction is frequently related to deviations in amplitudes, phasing, and coupling of circadian rhythms.\n Gene polymorphisms of melatonin receptors and circadian oscillator proteins bear risks for several of the diseases mentioned.\n A common symptom of insufficient melatonin signaling is sleep disturbances.\n It is necessary to distinguish between symptoms that are curable by short

improving symptoms associated with poorly coupled circadian rhythms, including seasonal affective and bipolar disorders.\n For purposes of a replacement therapy based on longer-lasting melatonergic actions, melatonin prolonged release and synthetic agonists have been developed.\n Therapies with melatonin or synthetic melatonergic drugs have to consider that these agents do not only act on the

Gene <italic>Cry1</italic> in the Ovine Pars Tuberalis","abstract":"Seasonal mammals integrate changes in the duration of nocturnal melatonin secretion to drive annual physiologic cycles.\n Melatonin receptors within the proximal pituitary region, the pars tuberalis (PT), are essential in regulating seasonal neuroendocrine responses.\n In the ovine PT, melatonin is known to influence acute changes in transcriptional dynamics coupled to the onset (dusk) and offset (dawn) of melatonin secretion, leading to a potential interval-timing mechanism capable of decoding changes in day length (photoperiod).\n Melatonin offset at dawn is linked to cAMP accumulation, which directly induces transcription of the clock gene Per1.\n The rise of melatonin at dusk induces a separate and distinct cohort, including the clock-regulated genes Cry1 and Nampt, but little is known of the up-stream mechanisms involved.\n Here, we used next-generation sequencing of the ovine PT transcriptome at melatonin onset and identified Npas4 as a rapidly induced basic helix-loop-helix Per-Arnt-Sim domain transcription factor.\n In vivo we show nuclear localization of NPAS4 protein in presumptive melatonin target cells of the PT (?-glycoprotein hormone-expressing cells), whereas in situ hybridization studies identified acute and transient expression in the PT of Npas4 in response to melatonin.\n In vitro, NPAS4 forms functional dimers with basic helix loop helix-PAS domain cofactors aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), ARNT2, and ARNTL, transactivating both Cry1 and Nampt ovine promoter reporters.\n Using a combination of 5?-deletions and site-directed mutagenesis, we show NPAS4-ARNT transactivation to be codependent upon two conserved central midline elements within the Cry1 promoter.\n Our data thus reveal NPAS4 as a candidate immediate early-response gene in the ovine PT, driving molecular responses to melatonin.\n","id":"PMC3689899","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"A.","surname":"West","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.M.","surname":"Dupré","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L.","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"I.R.","surname":"Paton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"K.","surname":"Miedzinska","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.S.","surname":"McNeilly","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.R.E.","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.W.","surname":"Burt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.S.I.","surname":"Loudon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.5271/sjweh.3414","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Rotating-shift

post-transcription to control mRNA stability and protein translation.\n Though melatonin was known as an anti-angiogenic agent, the underlying mechanism of melatonin in PC-3 prostate cancer cells under hypoxia still remains unclear.\n Thus, in the current study, we elucidated the important roles of miRNAs in melatonin-induced anti-angiogenic activity in hypoxic PC-3 cells.\n miRNA array revealed that 33 miRNAs (&gt;2 folds) including miRNA3195 and miRNA 374b were significantly upregulated and 16 miRNAs were downregulated in melatonin-treated PC-3 cells under hypoxia compared to untreated control.\n Melatonin significantly attenuated the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at mRNA level in hypoxic PC-3 cells.\n Consistently, melatonin enhanced the expression of miRNA3195 and miRNA 374b in hypoxic PC-3 cells by qRT-PCR analysis.\n Of note, overexpression of miRNA3195 and miRNA374b mimics attenuated the mRNA levels of angiogenesis related genes such as HIF-1alpha, HIF-2 alpha and VEGF in PC-3 cells under hypoxia.\n Furthermore, overexpression of miRNA3195 and miRNA374b suppressed typical angiogenic protein VEGF at the protein level and VEGF production induced by melatonin, while antisense oligonucleotides against miRNA 3195 or miRNA 374b did not affect VEGF production induced by melatonin.\n Also, overexpression of miR3195 or miR374b reduced HIF-1 alpha immunofluorescent expression in hypoxic PC-3 compared to untreated control.\n Overall, our findings suggest that

Signaling in Platelets of Serotonin Transporter Deficient Mice","abstract":"Background\nSerotonin (5-hydroxytryptamin, 5-HT) is an indolamine platelet agonist, biochemically derived from tryptophan.\n\n 5-HT is secreted from the enterochromaffin cells into the gastrointestinal tract and blood.\n\n Blood 5-HT has been proposed to regulate hemostasis by acting as a vasoconstrictor and by triggering platelet signaling through 5-HT receptor 2A (5HTR2A).\n\n Although platelets do not synthetize 5-HT, they take 5-HT up from the blood and store it in their dense granules which are secreted upon platelet activation.\n\n\nObjective\nTo identify the molecular composite of the 5-HT uptake system in platelets and elucidate the role of platelet released 5-HT in thrombosis and ischemic stroke.\n\n Methods: 5-HT transporter knockout mice (5Htt-/-) were analyzed in different in vitro and in vivo assays and in a model of ischemic stroke.\n\n\nResults\nIn 5Htt-/- platelets, 5-HT uptake from the blood was completely abolished and agonist-induced Ca2+ influx through store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), integrin activation, degranulation and aggregation responses to glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) were reduced.\n\n These observed in vitro defects in 5Htt-/- platelets could be normalized by the addition of exogenous 5-HT.\n\n Moreover, reduced 5-HT levels in the plasma, an increased bleeding time and the formation of unstable thrombi were observed ex vivo under flow and in vivo in the abdominal aorta and carotid artery of 5Htt-/- mice.\n\n Surprisingly, in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model of ischemic stroke 5Htt-/- mice showed nearly normal infarct volume and the neurological outcome was comparable to control mice.\n\n\nConclusion\nAlthough secreted platelet 5-HT does not appear to play a crucial role in the development of reperfusion injury after stroke, it is essential to amplify the second phase of platelet activation through SOCE and plays an important role in thrombus stabilization.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4723080","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Karen","surname":"Wolf","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Attila","surname":"Braun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elizabeth

intraperitoneally at 0.1 ml/100 g), a vehicle group (n=8), which was subjected to occlusion of the left renal artery and vehicle treatment, and the MLT group (n=8), which was subjected to occlusion of the left renal artery and treated with MLT (10 mg/kg/day).\n Pathological features of the renal tissues were determined using hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson staining.\n Urine protein, serum creatinine (Scr), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined.\n Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to determine the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).\n Furthermore, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was conducted to determine the mRNA expression of HO-1, ICAM-1, eNOS and iNOS.\n A marked decrease in blood pressure was noticed in the MLT group at week 4 compared with that of the vehicle group (P&lt;0.01).\n Furthermore, MLT treatment attenuated the infiltration of inflammatory cells and oedema/atrophy of renal tubules.\n MLT attenuated hypertension-induced increases in urine protein excretion, serum creatinine and MDA as well as decreases in SOD activity in renal tissues.\n Furthermore, MLT attenuated hypertension-induced increases in iNOS and ICAM-1 as well as decreases in eNOS

participate in blood pressure regulation.\n The antihypertensive effect of melatonin was demonstrated in experimental and clinical hypertension.\n Receptor-dependent effects are mediated predominantly through MT1 and MT2 G-protein coupled receptors.\n The pleiotropic receptor-independent effects of melatonin with a possible impact on blood pressure involve the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging nature, activation and over-expression of several antioxidant enzymes or their protection from oxidative damage and the ability to increase the efficiency of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.\n Besides the interaction with the vascular system, this indolamine may exert part of its antihypertensive action through its interaction with the central nervous system (CNS).\n The imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic vegetative system is an important pathophysiological disorder and therapeutic target in hypertension.\n Melatonin is protective in CNS on several different levels: It reduces free radical burden, improves endothelial dysfunction, reduces inflammation and shifts the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic system in favor of the parasympathetic system.\n The increased level of serum melatonin observed in some types of hypertension may be a counter-regulatory adaptive mechanism against the sympathetic overstimulation.\n Since melatonin acts favorably on different levels of hypertension, including organ protection and with minimal side effects, it could become regularly involved in the struggle against this widespread

intraperitoneal (i.\n\np.\n\n) administration of 65 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ).\n\n Surgical bone defects were prepared in the tibia of each animal.\n\n Diabetic animals and those in control groups were treated either with daily melatonin (250 ?g/animal/day/i.\n\np.\n\n) diluted in ethanol, only ethanol, or sterile saline solution.\n\n Rats were humanely killed at the 10th and 30th postoperative days.\n\n Plasma levels of Advanced Oxidation Protein Products (AOPP), Malondialdehyde (MDA), and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) were measured.\n\n The number of osteoblasts, blood vessels and the area of new mineralized tissue formation were calculated in histologic sections.\n\n\nResults\n At the 10th day, DM+MEL (rats receiving both STZ and melatonin) group had significantly higher number of osteoblasts and blood vessels as well as larger new mineralized tissue surfaces (p&lt;0.05 for each) when compared with DM group.\n\n At the 30th day, DM group treated with melatonin had significantly lower levels of AOPP and MDA than those of DM group (p&lt;0.05).\n\n\nConclusion\n Melatonin administration in STZ induced diabetic rats reduced oxidative stress related biomarkers and showed

metabolism, type 2 diabetes, and the amplitude of daily rhythms in white adipose tissue (WAT).\n\n However, data interpretation is confounded by differences in genetic background and diet or limited sampling points.\n\n We have taken the novel approach of analyzing serial human WAT biopsies across a 24-h cycle in controlled laboratory conditions.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nLean (n = 8), overweight/obese (n = 11), or overweight/obese type 2 diabetic (n = 8) volunteers followed a strict sleep–wake and dietary regimen for 1 week prior to the laboratory study.\n\n They were then maintained in controlled light–dark conditions in a semirecumbent posture and fed hourly during wake periods.\n\n Subcutaneous WAT biopsies were collected every 6 h over 24 h, and gene expression was measured by quantitative PCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLean individuals exhibited significant (P &lt; 0.05) temporal changes of core clock (PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY2, BMAL1, and DBP) and metabolic (REVERB?, RIP140, and PGC1?) genes.\n\n The BMAL1 rhythm was in approximate antiphase with the other clock genes.\n\n It is noteworthy that there was no significant effect (P &gt; 0.05) of increased body weight or type 2 diabetes on rhythmic gene expression.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe robust nature of these rhythms and their relative phasing indicate that WAT now can be considered as a peripheral tissue suitable for the study of in vivo human rhythms.\n\n Comparison of data between subject groups clearly indicates that obesity and type 2 diabetes are not related to the amplitude of rhythmic WAT gene expression in humans maintained under controlled conditions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3292333","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniella

chronic kidney disease.\n Few studies have analyzed the consequence of obesity in the renal proximal convoluted tubules, which are the major tubules involved in reabsorptive processes.\n For optimal performance of the kidney, energy is primarily provided by mitochondria.\n Melatonin, an indoleamine and antioxidant, has been identified in mitochondria, and there is considerable evidence regarding its essential role in the prevention of oxidative mitochondrial damage.\n In this study we evaluated the mechanism(s) of mitochondrial alterations in an animal model of obesity (ob/ob mice) and describe the beneficial effects of melatonin treatment on mitochondrial morphology and dynamics as influenced by mitofusin-2 and the intrinsic apoptotic cascade.\n Melatonin dissolved in 1% ethanol was added to the drinking water from postnatal week 5–13; the calculated dose of melatonin intake was 100 mg/kg body weight/day.\n Compared to control mice, obesity-related morphological alterations were apparent in the proximal tubules which contained round mitochondria with irregular, short cristae and cells with elevated apoptotic index.\n Melatonin supplementation in obese mice changed mitochondria shape and cristae organization of proximal tubules, enhanced mitofusin-2 expression, which in turn modulated the progression of the mitochondria-driven intrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n These changes possibly aid in reducing renal failure.\n The melatonin-mediated changes indicate its potential protective use against renal morphological damage and dysfunction associated with obesity

disease.\n","id":"PMC4210266","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alessandra","surname":"Stacchiotti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gaia","surname":"Favero","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lorena","surname":"Giugno","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Lavazza","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Russel

36 weeks while groups C and D were fed with a regular diet (RD).\n\n During the last 12 weeks, Groups A and C were treated with 10 mg/kg melatonin while Groups B and D were treated with water in the same volume by intragastric administration.\n\n Body and liver weight, blood glucose, serum transaminases and lipid levels, and markers of hepatic inflammation were measured.\n\n Histological analyses were also performed on liver tissue.\n\n\nResults\nAfter 12 weeks of treatment with melatonin, body weights (Group A: before 53.11?±?0.72 vs after 12w treatment 39.48?±?0.74) and liver weights (A

plays a key role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis, and soluble A? oligomers are more cytotoxic than A? fibrils.\n\n Recent evidence suggests that Notch signaling is affected by AD and other brain diseases.\n\n Melatonin exerts beneficial effects on many aspects of AD and may protect against myocardial ischemia via Notch1 signaling regulation.\n\n Therefore, we hypothesized that the Notch1 signaling pathway is involved in the neuroprotective role of melatonin against soluble A?1–42.\n\n\nMethods\nAn AD rat model was established via repeated intracerebroventricular administration of soluble A?1–42.\n\n Melatonin treatment was administered 24 hours prior to A?1–42 administration via an intraperitoneal injection.\n\n The effects of melatonin on spatial learning and memory, synaptic plasticity, and astrogliosis were investigated.\n\n The expression of several Notch1 signaling components, including Notch1, the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), Hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1, a downstream effector of Notch), and Musashi1 (a positive regulator of Notch), were examined using immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and quantitative real-time PCR.\n\n In vitro studies were conducted to determine whether the melatonin-mediated protection against A?1–42 was inhibited by DAPT, an inhibitor of Notch signaling.\n\n\nResults\nMelatonin improved the A?1–42-induced impairment in spatial learning and memory, attenuated synaptic dysfunction, and reduced astrogliosis.\n\n Melatonin also ameliorated the effects of A?1–42 on Notch1, NICD, Hes1, and Musashi1. The in vitro studies demonstrated that DAPT effectively blocked the neuroprotective effect of melatonin against A?1–42.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings suggest that melatonin may improve the soluble A?1–42-induced impairment of spatial learning and memory, synaptic plasticity, and astrogliosis via the Musashi1/Notch1/Hes1 signaling pathway.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5024520","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shuman","surname":"Zhang","email":"zsm19900206@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pan","surname":"Wang","email":"panw1616@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"1505445414@qq.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chunli","surname":"Hu","email":"huchunli1017@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Bi","email":"bijing@lnmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/mds.26592","date":"2016-02-03","title":"Hypothalamic volume loss is associated with reduced melatonin output in Parkinson's disease","abstract":"Background\nRecent studies have suggested that melatonin—a hormone produced by the pineal gland under circadian control—contributes to PD?related sleep dysfunction.\n\n We hypothesized that degenerative changes to the neural structures controlling pineal function (especially the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus) may be responsible for reduced melatonin output in these patients.\n\n We compared hypothalamic volumes in PD patients with matched controls and determined whether volume loss correlated with reduced melatonin output in the PD group.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 12 PD patients and 12 matched controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging to determine hypothalamic volume.\n\n In addition, PD patients underwent 24?hour blood sampling in a controlled environment to determine serum melatonin concentrations using enzyme?linked immunosorbent assays.\n\n\nResults\nPD patients had significantly reduced hypothalamic gray matter volume when compared with matched controls.\n\n Melatonin levels were significantly associated with hypothalamic gray matter volume and disease severity in PD patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nMelatonin levels are associated with hypothalamic gray matter volume loss and disease severity in PD patients.\n\n This provides anatomical and physiological support for an intrinsic sleep and circadian phenotype in PD.\n\n © 2016 The Authors.\n\n Movement Disorders published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\n on behalf of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society\n","id":"PMC5025727","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David P.","surname":"Breen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cristina","surname":"Nombela","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Romina","surname":"Vuono","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.

expression of SIRT1, a silent information regulator that regulates stress responses, inflammation, cellular senescence and apoptosis.\n This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of melatonin on renal tissues of burned rats and the role of SIRT1 involving the effects.\n Rat severely burned model was established, with or without the administration of melatonin and SIRT1 inhibitor.\n The renal function and histological manifestations were determined to evaluate the severity of kidney injury.\n The levels of acetylated-p53 (Ac-p53), acetylated-p65 (Ac-p65), NF-?B, acetylated-forkhead box O1 (Ac-FoxO1), Bcl-2 and Bax were analyzed to study the underlying mechanisms.\n Our results suggested that severe burns could induce acute kidney injury, which could be partially reversed by melatonin.\n Melatonin attenuated oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis accompanied by the increased expression of SIRT1.

of obesity.\n\n\nRecent Findings\nid='Par2'>Possible causes of EE are high dietary restraint, poor interoceptive awareness, alexithymia, emotion dysregulation and a reversed hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) stress axis.\n\n EE may be the outcome of inadequate parenting or depressive feelings in interaction with genetic susceptibility.\n\n There is also robust evidence that EE is a mediator between depression and obesity.\n\n\nSummary\nid='Par3'>The association of EE with depression and poor emotion regulation skills suggests that the treatment of obese people with high EE should not focus on calorie-restricted diets but on emotion regulation skills.\n\n The DEBQ (Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire) enables such a matched treatment of

association with Body Mass Index in Dutch children aged 6–7","abstract":"Background\nThe Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) is a parent-report measure designed to assess variation in eating style among children.\n\n In the present study we translated the CEBQ and examined its factor structure in a sample of parents of 6- and 7-year-old children in the Netherlands.\n\n Additionally, associations between the mean scale scores of the instrument and children's body mass index (BMI) were assessed.\n\n\nMethods\nIn total, 135 parents of primary school children aged 6 and 7 completed the questionnaire (response rate 41.9%).\n\n Children's BMI was converted into standardised z-scores, adjusted for child gender and age to examine the association between mean scale scores and child weight status.\n\n\nResults\nResults generally confirmed the theoretical factor structure, with acceptable internal reliability and between-subscale correlations.\n\n Linear regression analyses revealed that BMI z-scores were positively associated with the 'food approach' subscales of the CEBQ (food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, emotional overeating) (?'s 0.15 to 0.22) and negatively with 'food avoidant' subscales (satiety responsiveness, slowness in eating, emotional undereating, and food fussiness) (?'s -0.09 to -0.25).\n\n Significant relations with child BMI z-scores were found for food responsiveness (p = 0.02), enjoyment of food (p = 0.03), satiety responsiveness (p = 0.01) and slowness in eating (p = 0.01).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe results support the use of the CEBQ as a psychometrically sound tool for assessing children's eating behaviours in Dutch children and the study demonstrates its applicability in overweight-related studies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2612017","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ester

Inter-individual variation of D2 receptor density is thought to influence disease risk and pharmacological response.\n Numerous molecular imaging studies have tested whether common genetic variants influence D2 receptor binding potential (BP) in humans, but demonstration of robust effects has been limited by small sample sizes.\n We performed a systematic search of published human in vivo molecular imaging studies to estimate effect sizes of common genetic variants on striatal D2 receptor BP.\n We identified 21 studies examining 19 variants in 11 genes.\n The most commonly studied variant was a single-nucleotide polymorphism in ANKK1 (rs1800497, Glu713Lys, also called ‘Taq1A').\n Fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses of this variant (5 studies, 194 subjects total) revealed that striatal BP was significantly and robustly lower among carriers of the minor allele (Lys713) relative to major allele homozygotes.\n The weighted standardized mean difference was ?0.57 under the fixed-effect model (95% confidence interval=(?0.87, ?0.27), P=0.0002).\n The normal relationship between rs1800497 and BP was not apparent among subjects with neuropsychiatric diseases.\n Significant associations with baseline striatal D2 receptor BP have been reported for four DRD2 variants (rs1079597, rs1076560, rs6277 and rs1799732) and a PER2 repeat polymorphism, but none have yet been tested in more than two independent samples.\n Our findings resolve apparent discrepancies in the literature and establish that rs1800497 robustly influences striatal D2 receptor availability.\n This genetic variant is likely to contribute to important individual differences in human striatal function, neuropsychiatric disease risk and pharmacological response.\n","id":"PMC4872447","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"B S","surname":"Gluskin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"B

population-based studies with 4·4 million participants","abstract":"Background\nOne of the global targets for non-communicable diseases is to halt, by 2025, the rise in the age-standardised adult prevalence of diabetes at its 2010 levels.\n\n We aimed to estimate worldwide trends in diabetes, how likely it is for countries to achieve the global target, and how changes in prevalence, together with population growth and ageing, are affecting the number of adults with diabetes.\n\n\nMethods\nWe pooled data from population-based studies that had collected data on diabetes through measurement of its biomarkers.\n\n We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends in diabetes prevalence—defined as fasting plasma glucose of 7·0 mmol/L or higher, or history of diagnosis with diabetes, or use of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs—in 200 countries and territories in 21 regions, by sex and from 1980 to 2014. We also calculated the posterior probability of meeting the global diabetes target if post-2000 trends continue.\n\n\nFindings\nWe used data from 751 studies including 4?372?000 adults from 146 of the 200 countries we make estimates for.\n\n Global age-standardised diabetes prevalence increased from 4·3% (95% credible interval 2·4–7·0) in 1980 to 9·0% (7·2–11·1) in 2014 in men, and from 5·0% (2·9–7·9) to 7·9% (6·4–9·7) in women.\n\n The number of adults with diabetes in the world increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 (28·5% due to the rise in prevalence, 39·7% due to population growth and ageing, and 31·8% due to interaction of these two factors).\n\n Age-standardised adult diabetes prevalence in 2014 was lowest in northwestern Europe, and highest in Polynesia and Micronesia, at nearly 25%, followed by Melanesia and the Middle East and north Africa.\n\n Between 1980 and 2014 there was little change in age-standardised diabetes prevalence in adult women in continental western Europe, although crude prevalence rose because of ageing of the population.\n\n By contrast, age-standardised adult prevalence rose by 15 percentage points in men and women in Polynesia and Micronesia.\n\n In 2014, American Samoa had the highest national prevalence of diabetes (&gt;30% in both sexes), with age-standardised adult prevalence also higher than 25% in some other islands in Polynesia and Micronesia.\n\n If post-2000 trends continue, the probability of meeting the global target of halting the rise in the prevalence of diabetes by 2025 at the 2010 level worldwide is lower than 1% for men and is 1% for women.\n\n Only nine countries for men and 29 countries for women, mostly in western Europe, have a 50% or higher probability of meeting the global target.\n\n\nInterpretation\nSince 1980, age-standardised diabetes prevalence in adults has increased, or at best remained unchanged, in every country.\n\n Together with population growth and ageing, this rise has led to a near quadrupling of the number of adults with diabetes worldwide.\n\n The burden of diabetes, both in terms of prevalence and number of adults affected, has increased faster in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome

emerge related to fat deposition and function of WAT.\n Thus, further research is warranted to more carefully define the strengths and limitations of rodent WAT as a model for humans, with a

critical VAT threshold (CVATT).\n Exceeding the CVATT may result in a number of metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance to glucose uptake by cells.\n Metabolic profiles of patients with visceral obesity may substantially improve after only modest weight loss.\n This could reflect a significant reduction in the amount of VAT relative to peripheral or subcutaneous fat depots, thereby maintaining VAT below the CVATT.\n The CVATT may be unique for each individual.\n This may help explain the phenomena of apparently lean individuals with metabolic syndrome, the so-called metabolically normal weight (MONW), as well as the obese with normal metabolic profiles, i.\ne.\n, metabolically normal obese (MNO), and those who are 'fit and fat.\n' The concept of CVATT may have implications for prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome, which may include controlling dietary carbohydrates.\n The identification of the CVATT is admittedly difficult and its anatomical

recent evidence suggests that PVAT develops from its own distinct precursors implying a closer link between PVAT and vascular system.\n Under physiological conditions, PVAT has potent anti-atherogenic properties mediated by its ability to secrete various biologically active factors that induce non-shivering thermogenesis and metabolize fatty acids.\n In contrast, under pathological conditions

promoting atherosclerosis development.\n Since PVAT plays crucial roles in regulating key steps of atherosclerosis development, it may constitute a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and

that primarily functions as a fat reservoir.\n For this reason, adipose tissue is considered as the primary site for initiation and aggravation of obesity and T2DM.\n As a key endocrine organ, the adipose tissue communicates with other organs, such as the brain, liver, muscle, and pancreas, for the maintenance of energy homeostasis.\n Two different types of adipose tissues—the white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT)—secrete bioactive peptides and proteins, known as “adipokines” and “batokines,” respectively.\n Some of them have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, while others have harmful inflammatory effects.\n Recently, “exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs)” were identified as novel adipokines, as adipose tissue-derived exosomal miRNAs can affect other organs.\n In the present review, we discuss the role of adipose-derived secretory factors—adipokines, batokines, and exosomal miRNA—in obesity and T2DM.\n It will provide new insights into the pathophysiological

the postnatal stage in response to chronic cold or PPAR? agonists.\n Beige cells’ inducible characteristics make them a promising therapeutic target for obesity treatment, however, the relevance of

fat-selective genes such as PRDM16 was strongly correlated with that of the newly identified beige cell-selective genes, but not with that of classical brown fat-selective genes.\n Furthermore,

remediation of type-2 diabetes; however, the mechanisms leading to these improvements are unclear.\n\n Additionally, adipocytes within white adipose tissue (WAT) depots can manifest characteristics of brown adipocytes.\n\n These ‘BRITE/beige’ adipocytes express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and are associated with improvements in glucose homeostasis and protection from obesity.\n\n Interestingly, atrial and B-type natriuretic peptides (NPs) promote BRITE/beige adipocyte enrichment of WAT depots, an effect known as “browning.\n\n” Here, we investigate the effect of RYGB surgery on NP, NP receptors, and browning in the gonadal adipose tissues of female mice.\n\n We propose that such changes may lead to improvements in metabolic homeostasis commonly observed following RYGB.\n\n\nMethods\nWild type, female, C57/Bl6 mice were fed a 60% fat diet ad libitum for six months.\n\n Mice were divided into three groups: Sham operated (SO), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and Weight matched, sham operated (WM-SO).\n\n Mice were sacrificed six weeks following surgery and evaluated for differences in body weight, glucose homeostasis, adipocyte morphology, and adipose tissue

Npr2, and ?3-adrenergic receptors in gonadal adipose tissue following RYGB was associated with increased markers of browning.\n\n This browning of gonadal adipose tissue may underpin the positive

linoleic acid (10,12 CLA) promotes fat loss in obese mice and humans, but has also been associated with insulin resistance.\n\n\nObjective\nWe therefore sought to directly compare weight loss by 10,12 CLA versus caloric restriction (CR, 15–25%), an acceptable healthy method of weight loss, to determine how 10,12 CLA-mediated weight loss fails to improve glucose metabolism.\n\n\nMethods\nObese mice with characteristics of human metabolic syndrome were either supplemented with 10,12 CLA or subjected to CR to promote weight loss.\n\n Metabolic endpoints such as energy expenditure, glucose and insulin tolerance testing, and trunk fat distribution were measured.\n\n\nResults\nBy design, 10,12 CLA and CR caused equivalent weight loss, with greater fat loss by 10,12 CLA accompanied by increased energy expenditure, reduced respiratory quotient, increased fat oxidation, accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages, and browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT).\n\n Moreover, 10,12 CLA-supplemented mice better defended their body temperature against a cold challenge.\n\n However, 10,12 CLA concurrently induced the detrimental loss of subcutaneous WAT without reducing visceral WAT, promoted reduced plasma and WAT adipokine levels, worsened hepatic steatosis, and failed to improve glucose metabolism.\n\n Obese mice undergoing CR were protected from subcutaneous-specific fat loss, had improved hepatic steatosis, and subsequently showed the expected improvements in WAT adipokines, glucose metabolism and WAT inflammation.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results suggest that 10,12 CLA mediates the preferential loss of subcutaneous fat that likely contributes to hepatic steatosis and maintained insulin resistance, despite significant weight loss and WAT browning in mice.\n\n Collectively, we have shown that weight loss due to 10,12 CLA supplementation or CR results in dramatically different metabolic phenotypes, with the latter promoting a healthier form of weight loss.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5330530","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura J.","surname":"den

scWAT.\n Consistent with the increase in UCP1, exercise training increases the presence of brown-like adipocytes in scWAT, also known as browning or beiging.\n Training results in changes in the gene expression of thousands of scWAT genes and an altered adipokine profile in both scWAT and vWAT.\n Transplantation of trained scWAT in sedentary recipient mice results in striking improvements in skeletal muscle glucose uptake and whole-body metabolic homeostasis.\n Human and rodent exercise studies have indicated that exercise training can alter circulating adipokine concentration as well as adipokine expression in adipose tissue.\n Thus, the profound changes to WAT in response to exercise training may be part of the mechanism by which exercise improves whole-body metabolic health.\n","id":"PMC4477356","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kristin I.","surname":"Stanford","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Roeland

this study was to examine whether resistin mRNA expression in human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and its corresponding plasma levels are altered in type 2 diabetes.\n Resistin mRNA levels were easily detectable in human PBMC, and found to be higher in DM2 compared to healthy women (P = .\n05).\n Similarly, mononuclear mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1?, TNF-?, and IL-6 were all significantly higher in DM2 compared to control women (P &lt; .\n001).\n The corresponding plasma resistin levels were slightly, but not significantly, increased in DM2 women (P = .\n051), and overall, they correlated significantly with BMI (r = 0.406, P = .\n010) and waist circumference (r = 0.516, P = .\n003), but not with fasting insulin levels or HOMA-IR.\n Resistin mRNA expression is increased in PBMC from DM2 women, together with increased expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1?, TNF-?, and IL-6, independent of obesity.\n These results suggest that resistin and cytokines might contribute to the low-grade inflammation and the increased atherogenic risk observed in these

by excess accumulation of lipids in adipose tissue and other organs, and chronic inflammation associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.\n Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases are major health concerns.\n Resistin was first discovered as an adipose-secreted hormone (adipokine) linked to obesity and insulin resistance in rodents.\n Adipocyte-derived resistin is increased in obese rodents and strongly related to insulin resistance.\n However, in contrast to rodents, resistin is expressed and secreted from macrophages in humans and is increased in inflammatory conditions.\n Some studies have also suggested an association between increased resistin levels and insulin resistance, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n Genetic studies have provided additional evidence for a role of resistin in insulin resistance and inflammation.\n Resistin appears to mediate the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by promoting endothelial dysfunction, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, arterial inflammation, and formation of foam cells.\n Indeed, resistin is predictive of atherosclerosis and poor clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke.\n There is also growing evidence that elevated resistin is associated with the development of heart failure.\n This review will focus on the biology of resistin in rodents and humans, and evidence linking resistin with type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular

adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, increased inflammation, impaired extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis together with an altered secretion of adipokines.\n This review describes the

State","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nFibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a key mediator of fatty acid oxidation and lipid metabolism.\n\n Pharmacological doses of FGF21 improve glucose tolerance, lower serum free fatty acids, and lead to weight loss in obese mice.\n\n Surprisingly, however, FGF21 levels are elevated in obese ob/ob and db/db mice and correlate positively with BMI in humans.\n\n However, the expected beneficial effects of endogenous FGF21 to increase glucose tolerance and reduce circulating triglycerides are absent in obesity.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nTo test the hypothesis that obesity is a state of FGF21 resistance, we evaluated the response of obese mice to exogenous FGF21 administration.\n\n In doing this, we assessed the impact of diet-induced obesity on FGF21 signaling and resultant transcriptional events in the liver and white adipose tissue.\n\n We also analyzed the physiologic impact of FGF21 resistance by assessing serum parameters that are acutely regulated by FGF21.\nRESULTS\nWhen obese mice are treated with FGF21, they display both a significantly attenuated signaling response as assessed by extracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation as well as an impaired induction of FGF21 target genes, including cFos and EGR1. These effects were seen in both liver and fat.\n\n Similarly, changes in serum parameters such as the decline in glucose and free fatty acids are attenuated in FGF21-treated DIO mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data demonstrate that DIO mice have increased endogenous levels of FGF21 and respond poorly to exogenous FGF21. We therefore propose that obesity is an FGF21-resistant state.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2963536","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"ffolliott

effects on obesity and diabetes.\n\n In humans, thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) was recently suggested as a source of FGF21 secretion during cold exposure.\n\n Here, we aim to clarify the role of UCP1 and ambient temperature in the regulation of FGF21 in mice.\n\n\nMethods\nWildtype (WT) and UCP1-knockout (UCP1 KO) mice, the latter being devoid of BAT-derived non-shivering thermogenesis, were exposed to different housing temperatures.\n\n Plasma metabolites and FGF21 levels were determined, gene expression was analyzed by qPCR, and tissue histology was performed with adipose tissue.\n\n\nResults\nAt thermoneutrality, FGF21 gene expression and serum levels were not different between WT and UCP1 KO mice.\n\n Cold exposure led to highly increased FGF21 serum levels in UCP1 KO mice, which were reflected in increased FGF21 gene expression in adipose tissues but not in liver and skeletal muscle.\n\n Ex vivo secretion assays revealed FGF21 release only from BAT, progressively increasing with decreasing ambient temperatures.\n\n In association with increased FGF21 serum levels in the UCP1 KO mouse, typical FGF21-related serum metabolites and inguinal white adipose tissue morphology and thermogenic gene expression were altered.\n\n\nConclusions\nHere we show that the genetic ablation of UCP1 increases FGF21 gene expression in adipose tissue.\n\n The removal of adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis renders BAT a significant source of endogenous FGF21 under thermal stress.\n\n Thus, the thermogenic competence of BAT is not a requirement for FGF21 secretion.\n\n Notably, high endogenous FGF21 levels in UCP1-deficient models and subjects may confound pharmacological FGF21

risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\n However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that link obesity to chronic inflammation and CVD are poorly understood.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nAcute-phase serum amyloid A (A-SAA) mRNA levels, and A-SAA adipose secretion and serum levels were measured in obese and nonobese individuals, obese participants who underwent weight-loss, and persons treated with the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone.\n\n Inflammation-eliciting activity of A-SAA was investigated in human adipose stromal vascular cells, coronary vascular endothelial cells and a murine monocyte cell line.\n\n We demonstrate that A-SAA was highly and selectively expressed in human adipocytes.\n\n Moreover, A-SAA mRNA levels and A-SAA secretion from adipose tissue were significantly correlated with body mass index (\nr = 0.47;\np = 0.028 and\nr = 0.80;\np = 0.0002, respectively).\n\n Serum A-SAA levels decreased significantly after weight loss in obese participants (\np = 0.006), as well as in those treated with rosiglitazone (\np = 0.033).\n\n The magnitude of the improvement in insulin sensitivity after weight loss was significantly correlated with decreases in serum A-SAA (\nr = ?0.74;\np = 0.034).\n\n SAA treatment of vascular endothelial cells and monocytes markedly increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, e.\n\ng.\n\n, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. In addition, SAA increased basal lipolysis in adipose tissue culture by 47%.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nA-SAA is a proinflammatory and lipolytic adipokine in humans.\n\n The increased expression of A-SAA by adipocytes in obesity suggests that it may play a critical role in local and systemic inflammation and free fatty acid production and could be a direct link between obesity and its comorbidities, such as insulin resistance and atherosclerosis.\n\n Accordingly, improvements in systemic inflammation and insulin resistance with weight loss and rosiglitazone therapy may in part be mediated by decreases in adipocyte A-SAA production.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1472697","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rong-Ze","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mi-Jeong","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Toni

baseline survey of a cohort study in Tokushima Prefecture, Japan.\n\n Systemic inflammation level was assessed by serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and the degree of insulin

as a body mass index (BMI) of 23.0–24.9 kg/m2 and ?25.0 kg/m2, respectively.\n\n Associations between serum hs-CRP (assessed as quartiles and additionally continuous values after log-transformation)

recently correlated with obesity and insulin resistance.\n\n Therefore, we first examined whether human recombinant SAA (rSAA) could affect the proliferation, differentiation and metabolism of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.\n\n\nDESIGN:\nPreadipocytes were treated with rSAA and analyzed for changes in viability and [3H-methyl]-thymidine incorporation as well as cell cycle perturbations using flow cytometry analysis.\n\n The mRNA expression profiles of adipogenic factors during the differentiation protocol were also analyzed using real-time PCR.\n\n After differentiation, 2-deoxy-[1,2-3H]-glucose uptake and glycerol release were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nrSAA treatment caused a 2.6-fold increase in cell proliferation, which was consistent with the results from flow cytometry showing that rSAA treatment augmented the percentage of cells in the S phase (60.9±0.54%) compared with the control cells (39.8±2.2%, ***\nP&lt;0.001).\n\n The rSAA-induced cell proliferation was mediated by the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which was assessed by pretreatment with the inhibitor PD98059. However, the exposure of 3T3-L1 cells to rSAA during the differentiation process resulted in attenuated adipogenesis and decreased expression of adipogenesis-related factors.\n\n During the first 72?h of differentiation, rSAA inhibited the differentiation process by altering the mRNA expression kinetics of adipogenic transcription factors and proteins, such as PPAR?2 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? 2), C/EBP? (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ?) and GLUT4. rSAA prevented the intracellular accumulation of lipids and, in fully differentiated cells, increased lipolysis and prevented 2-deoxy-[1,2-3H]-glucose uptake, which favors insulin resistance.\n\n Additionally, rSAA stimulated the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor ?, and upregulated SAA3 mRNA expression during adipogenesis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWe showed that rSAA enhanced proliferation and inhibited differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and altered insulin sensitivity in differentiated cells.\n\n These results highlight the complex role of SAA in the adipogenic process and support a direct link between obesity and its co-morbidities such as type II diabetes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3419975","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"F B","surname":"Filippin-Monteiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"E

Generation of Monocyte Adhesion and Chemotactic Factors by Adipocytes","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nObesity is associated with monocyte-macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue.\n\n Previously, we showed that glucose-stimulated production by adipocytes of serum amyloid A (SAA), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and hyaluronan (HA) facilitated monocyte accumulation.\n\n The current objective was to determine how the other major nutrient, free fatty acids (FFAs), affects these molecules and monocyte recruitment by adipocytes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nDifferentiated 3T3-L1, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome adipocytes, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were exposed to various FFAs (250 ?mol/l) in either 5 or 25 mmol/l (high) glucose for evaluation of SAA, MCP-1, and HA regulation in vitro.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSaturated fatty acids (SFAs) such as laurate, myristate, and palmitate increased cellular triglyceride accumulation, SAA, and MCP-1 expression; generated reactive oxygen species (ROS); and increased nuclear factor (NF) ?B translocation in both 5 and 25 mmol/l glucose.\n\n Conversely, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonate, eicosapentaenate, and docosahexaenate (DHA) decreased these events.\n\n Gene expression could be dissociated from triglyceride accumulation.\n\n Although excess glucose increased HA content, SFAs, oleate, and linoleate did not.\n\n Antioxidant treatment repressed glucose- and palmitate-stimulated ROS generation and NF?B translocation and decreased SAA and MCP-1 expression and monocyte chemotaxis.\n\n Silencing toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) markedly reduced SAA and MCP-1 expression in response to palmitate but not glucose.\n\n DHA suppressed NF?B translocation stimulated by both excess glucose and palmitate via a peroxisome prolifterator–activated receptor (PPAR) ?–dependent pathway.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nExcess glucose and SFAs regulate chemotactic factor expression by a mechanism that involves ROS generation, NF?B, and PPAR?, and which is repressed by PUFAs.\n\n Certain SFAs, but not excess glucose, trigger chemotactic factor expression via a TLR4-dependent pathway.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2809975","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chang","surname":"Yeop Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Atil

mice gained less weight on the HFHSC diet compared to Saa3+/+ littermate controls, with no differences in body composition or resting metabolism.\n Female Saa3\n?/? mice, but not males, had reduced HFHSC diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation and macrophage content.\n Both male and female Saa3\n?/? mice had reduced liver Saa1 and Saa2 expression in association with reduced plasma SAA.\n Additionally, female Saa3\n?/? mice, but not males, showed improved plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein profiles, with no changes in glucose metabolism.\n Taken together, these results suggest that the absence of Saa3 attenuates liver-specific SAA (i.\ne.\n, SAA1/2) secretion into plasma and blunts weight gain induced by an obesogenic diet.\n Furthermore, adipose tissue-specific inflammation and macrophage accumulation are attenuated in female Saa3\n?/? mice, suggesting a novel sexually dimorphic role for this protein.\n These results also suggest that Saa3 influences liver-specific SAA1/2 expression, and that SAA3 could play a larger role in the acute phase response than previously thought.\n","id":"PMC4177399","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura J.","surname":"den Hartigh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shari","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Leela","surname":"Goodspeed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilei","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"Averill","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Savitha","surname":"Subramanian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tomasz","surname":"Wietecha","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kevin D.","surname":"O'Brien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Chait","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"G.

Mechanisms of Ceramide Action on Insulin Signaling","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nCeramide is now recognized as a negative regulator of insulin signaling by impairing protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt activation.\n\n In different cells, two distinct mechanisms have been proposed to mediate ceramide inhibition of PKB/Akt: one involving atypical protein kinase C zeta (PKC?) and the other the protein phosphatase-2 (PP2A).\n\n We hypothesized that ceramide action through PKC? or PP2A might depend on plasma membrane (PM) structural organization and especially on caveolin-enriched domain (CEM) abundance.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe have used different PKC? mutant constructs or the PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid (OKA), to selectively inhibit PKC?- and PP2A-dependent pathways in cells expressing different caveolin-1 levels and evaluated the impact of insulin and ceramide on PKB/Akt activity in different PM subdomains.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough the PKC?-mediated negative effect of ceramide on insulin-stimulated PKB/Akt was dominant in adipocytes, a ceramide action through PP2A outside CEMs, prevented by OKA, was also unraveled.\n\n To test the importance of CEM to direct ceramide action through the PKC? pathway, we treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes devoid of CEMs with ceramide and we saw a shift of the lipid-negative action on PKB/Akt to a PP2A-mediated mechanism.\n\n In fibroblasts with low CEM abundance, the ceramide-activated PP2A pathway dominated, but could be shifted to a ceramide-activated PKC? pathway after caveolin-1 overexpression.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results show that ceramide can switch from a PKC?-dependent mechanism to a PP2A pathway, acting negatively on PKB/Akt, and hence revealing a critical role of CEMs of the PM in this process.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2828662","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cédric

a defect that is central to obesity-linked type 2 diabetes, remain inadequate.\n Adiponectin, an abundant adipocyte-secreted factor with a wide-range of biological activities, improves insulin sensitivity in major insulin target tissues, modulates inflammatory responses, and plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy metabolism.\n However, adiponectin as a promising therapeutic

potential crosstalk between the adiponectin and other signaling pathways involved in metabolic regulation.\n Understanding better just why and how adiponectin and its downstream effector molecules

mice without changing bodyweight","abstract":"Background and Purpose\nWe have recently shown that a reduced function of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contributes crucially to obesity?induced vascular dysfunction in mice.\n\n The current study was conducted to test the hypothesis that vascular dysfunction in obesity can be reversed by in vivo improvement of PVAT eNOS activity.\n\n\nExperimental Approach\nMale C57BL/6J mice were fed a high?fat diet (HFD) for 22 weeks to induce obesity.\n\n During the last 4 weeks of HFD feeding, the obese mice were treated p.\n\no.\n\n with the standardized Crataegus extract WS® 1442, which has been shown previously to improve eNOS activity.\n\n\nKey Results\nDiet?induced obesity in mice markedly reduced the vasodilator response of thoracic aorta to acetylcholine in wire myograph experiments.\n\n Strikingly, this vascular dysfunction was only evident in PVAT?containing aorta but not in PVAT?free aorta.\n\n In vivo treatment of obese mice with WS® 1442 had no effect on body weight or epididymal fat mass, but completely restored the vascular function of PVAT?containing aorta.\n\n Feeding a HFD led to a reduced phosphorylation and an enhanced acetylation of PVAT eNOS, both effects were reversed by WS® 1442 treatment.\n\n\nConclusion and Implications\nPVAT plays a key role in vascular dysfunction in diet?induced obese mice.\n\n Not obesity itself, but a PVAT dysfunction is responsible for obesity?induced vascular disorders.\n\n Improving PVAT function by pharmacological means (e.\n\ng.\n\n with WS® 1442) can ameliorate vascular function even without reducing body weight or fat mass.\n\n\nLinked Articles\nThis article is part of a themed section on Molecular

Adipose Tissue as a Relevant Fat Depot for Cardiovascular Risk in Obesity","abstract":"Obesity is associated with increased risk of premature death, morbidity, and mortality from several cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure.\n However, this is not a straightforward relationship.\n Although several studies have substantiated that obesity confers an independent and additive risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death, there is significant variability in these associations, with some lean individuals developing diseases and others remaining healthy despite severe obesity, the so-called metabolically healthy obese.\n Part of this variability has been attributed to the heterogeneity in both the distribution of body fat and the intrinsic properties of adipose tissue depots, including developmental origin, adipogenic and proliferative capacity, glucose and lipid metabolism, hormonal control, thermogenic ability, and vascularization.\n In obesity, these depot-specific differences translate into specific fat distribution patterns, which are closely associated with differential cardiometabolic risks.\n The adventitial fat layer, also known as perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), is of major importance.\n Similar to the visceral adipose tissue, PVAT has a pathophysiological role in CVDs.\n PVAT influences vascular homeostasis by releasing numerous vasoactive factors, cytokines, and adipokines, which can readily target the underlying smooth muscle cell layers, regulating the vascular tone, distribution of blood flow, as well as angiogenesis, inflammatory processes, and redox status.\n In this review, we summarize the current knowledge and discuss the role of PVAT within the scope of adipose tissue as a major contributing factor to obesity-associated cardiovascular risk.\n Relevant clinical studies documenting the relationship between PVAT dysfunction and CVD with a focus on potential mechanisms by which PVAT contributes to obesity-related CVDs are pointed

brown fat","abstract":"Activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans increase glucose and fatty acid clearance as well as resting metabolic rate, whereas a prolonged elevation of BAT activity improves insulin sensitivity.\n However, substantial reductions in body weight following BAT activation has not yet been shown in humans.\n This observation raise the possibility for feedback mechanisms in adult humans in terms of a brown fat-brain crosstalk, possibly mediated by batokines, factors produced by and secreted from brown fat.\n Batokines also seems to be involved in BAT recruitment by stimulating proliferation and differentiation of brown fat progenitors.\n Increasing human BAT capacity could thus include inducing brown fat biogenesis as well as identifying novel batokines.\n Another attractive approach would be to induce a brown fat phenotype, the so-called brite or beige fat, within the white fat depots.\n In adult humans, white fat tissue transformation into beige has been observed in patients with pheochromocytoma, a norepinephrine-producing tumor.\n Interestingly, human beige fat is predominantly induced in regions that were BAT during early

adiposity syndrome","abstract":"The association of anthropometric (waist circumference) and hemodynamic (blood pressure) changes with abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism has been motivation for a lot of discussions in the last 30 years.\n Nowadays, blood pressure, body mass index/abdominal circumference, glycemia, triglyceridemia, and HDL-cholesterol concentrations are considered in the definition of Metabolic syndrome, referred as Visceral adiposity syndrome (VAS) in the present review.\n However, more than 250 years ago an association between visceral and mediastinal obesity with hypertension, gout, and obstructive apnea had already been recognized.\n Expansion of visceral adipose tissue secondary to chronic over-consumption of calories stimulates the recruitment of macrophages, which assume an inflammatory phenotype and produce cytokines that directly interfere with insulin signaling, resulting in insulin resistance.\n In turn, insulin resistance (IR) manifests itself in various tissues, contributing to the overall phenotype of VAS.\n For example, in white adipose tissue, IR results in lipolysis, increased free fatty acids release and worsening of inflammation, since fatty acids can bind to Toll-like receptors.\n In the liver, IR results in increased hepatic glucose production, contributing to hyperglycemia; in the vascular endothelium and kidney, IR results in vasoconstriction, sodium retention and, consequently, arterial hypertension.\n Other players have been recognized in the development of VAS, such as genetic predisposition, epigenetic factors associated with exposure to an unfavourable intrauterine environment and the gut microbiota.\n More recently, experimental and clinical studies have shown the autonomic nervous system participates in modulating visceral adipose tissue.\n The sympathetic nervous system is related to adipose tissue function and differentiation through beta1, beta2, beta3, alpha1, and alpha2 adrenergic receptors.\n The relation is bidirectional: sympathetic denervation of adipose tissue blocks lipolysis to a variety of lipolytic stimuli and adipose tissue send inputs to the brain.\n An imbalance of sympathetic/parasympathetic and alpha2 adrenergic/beta3 receptor is related to visceral adipose tissue storage and insulin sensitivity.\n Thus, in addition to the well-known factors classically associated with VAS, abnormal autonomic activity also emerges as an important factor regulating white adipose tissue, which highlights complex role of adipose tissue in the VAS.\n","id":"PMC4950710","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Heno F.","surname":"Lopes","email":"hipheno@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria

Insulin Signaling","abstract":"Presence of thermogenically active adipose tissue in adult humans has been inversely associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n While it had been shown that insulin is crucial for the development of classical brown fat, its role in development and function of inducible brown-in-white (brite) adipose tissue is less clear.\n Here we show that insulin deficiency impaired differentiation of brite adipocytes.\n However, adrenergic stimulation almost fully induced the thermogenic program under these settings.\n Although brite differentiation of adipocytes as well as browning of white adipose tissue entailed substantially elevated glucose uptake by adipose tissue, the capacity of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake surprisingly was not higher in the brite

tissue to type 2 diabetes","abstract":"id='Par1'>Mammalian adipose tissue is traditionally categorized into white and brown relating to their function and morphology: while white serves as an energy storage, brown adipose tissue acts as the heat generator maintaining the core body temperature.\n The most recently identified type of fat, beige adipocyte tissue, resembles brown fat by morphology and function but is developmentally more related to white.\n The synthesis of beige fat, so-called browning of white fat, has developed into a topical issue in diabetes and metabolism research.\n This is due to its favorable effect on whole-body energy metabolism and the fact that it can be recruited during adult life.\n Indeed, brown and beige adipose tissues have been demonstrated to play a role in glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism—all factors related to pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.\n Many agents capable of initiating browning have been identified so far and tested widely in humans and animal models including in vitro and in vivo experiments.\n Interestingly, several agents demonstrated to have browning activity are in fact secreted as adipokines from brown and beige fat tissue, suggesting a physiological relevance both in beige adipocyte recruitment processes and in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis.\n The newest findings on agents driving

two decades, the understanding of adipose tissue has undergone radical change.\n The perception has evolved from an inert energy storage tissue to that of an active endocrine organ.\n Adipose tissue releases a cluster of active molecules named adipokines.\n The severity of obesity-related diseases does not necessarily correlate with the extent of body fat accumulation but is closely related to body fat distribution, particularly to visceral localization.\n There is a distinction between the metabolic function of central obesity (visceral abdominal) and peripheral obesity (subcutaneous) in the production of adipokines.\n Visceral fat accumulation, linked with levels of some adipokines, induces chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders, including glucose intolerance, hyperlipidaemia, and arterial hypertension.\n Together, these conditions contribute to a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, directly associated with the onset of cardiovascular disease.\n If it is well known that adipokines contribute to the inflammatory profile and appetite regulation, this review is novel in synthesising the current state of knowledge of the role of visceral adipose tissue and its secretion

Cross-Sectional Observational Study","abstract":"Background:\nThe association between visceral obesity and cardiovascular risk has been well described.\n\n Some studies show a proportional relationship between the presence of visceral obesity and epicardial fat.\n\n Measuring the amount of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) can be a novel parameter that is inexpensive and easy to obtain and may be helpful in cardiovascular risk stratification.\n\n However, the relationship between epicardial fat and cardiac function and that between epicardial fat and cardiac risk factors is less well described.\n\n\nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the association between echocardiographic epicardial fat and the morphologic and physiologic changes observed at echocardiography and to evaluate the association between epicardial fat and cardiac risk factors.\n\n A cross-sectional study of 97 echocardiographic studies (females, n = 42) was conducted.\n\n Two groups were identified: epicardial fat ? 5 mm (group I) and &lt;5 mm (group II).\n\n\nResults:\nEpicardial fat &gt;5 mm was associated with LA enlargement, with lower ejection fraction, increased left ventricular mass, and abnormal diastolic function.\n\n On a multivariable regression analysis, all these parameters also correlated individually with EAT thickness independent of age.\n\n Hyperglycemia (DM), systolic hypertension, and lipid parameters for metabolic syndrome showed a trend for positive association, but this was not statistically significant.\n\n The association was not significant even for higher cutoff limits of EAT thickness.\n\n\nConclusion:\nEpicardial fat &gt;5 mm is associated with cardiac abnormalities on echocardiography.\n\n This is a sensitive assessment of body fat distribution, is easily available at echocardiography, and is simple to acquire at no added cost.\n\n Further studies looking at the appropriate cut-off thickness of EAT and the sites of measurement to be used are needed.\n\n Comparison of this simple and inexpensive measure with other measures of obesity, such as waist-hip ratio, body mass index, Dexa scan of visceral fat, and magnetic resonance imaging of visceral, are needed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3089830","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Farouk","surname":"Mookadam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ramil","surname":"Goel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohsen

vasculature, and it was routinely removed for isolated blood vessel studies.\n In 1991, Soltis and Cassis demonstrated for the first time that PVAT reduced contractions to noradrenaline in rat aorta.\n Since then, an important number of adipocyte-derived factors with physiological and pathophysiological paracrine vasoactive effects have been identified.\n PVAT undergoes structural and functional changes in obesity.\n During early diet-induced obesity, an adaptative overproduction of vasodilator factors occurs in PVAT, probably aimed at protecting vascular function.\n However, in established obesity, PVAT loses its anticontractile properties by an increase of contractile, oxidative, and inflammatory factors, leading to endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease.\n The aim of this review is to focus on PVAT dysfunction mechanisms in obesity.\n","id":"PMC3838835","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria

Apoe?/? and Ldlr?/? mice expresses functional apoE and LDLR.\n BAT activation increases energy expenditure and decreases plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels.\n Mechanistically, we demonstrate that BAT activation enhances the selective uptake of fatty acids from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins into BAT, subsequently accelerating the hepatic clearance of the cholesterol-enriched remnants.\n These effects depend on a functional hepatic apoE-LDLR clearance pathway as BAT activation in Apoe?/? and Ldlr?/? mice does not attenuate hypercholesterolaemia and atherosclerosis.\n We conclude that

Dysregulated Expression of Adipokines in White Adipose Tissue","abstract":"Obesity is recognized as a risk factor for lifestyle-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n White adipose tissue (WAT) is not only a static storage site for energy; it is also a dynamic tissue that is actively involved in metabolic reactions and produces humoral factors, such as leptin and adiponectin, which are collectively referred to as adipokines.\n Additionally, because there is much evidence that obesity-induced inflammatory changes in WAT, which is caused by dysregulated expression of inflammation-related adipokines involving tumor necrosis factor-? and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, contribute to the development of insulin resistance, WAT has attracted special attention as an organ that causes diabetes and other lifestyle-related diseases.\n Exercise training (TR) not only leads to a decrease in WAT mass but also attenuates obesity-induced dysregulated expression of the inflammation-related adipokines in WAT.\n Therefore, TR is widely used as a tool for preventing and improving lifestyle-related diseases.\n This review outlines the impact of TR on the expression and secretory response of adipokines in WAT.\n","id":"PMC3867917","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Takuya","surname":"Sakurai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junetsu","surname":"Ogasawara","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Takako","surname":"Kizaki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shogo","surname":"Sato","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yoshinaga","surname":"Ishibashi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yoshinaga","surname":"Ishibashi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Motoko","surname":"Takahashi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Osamu","surname":"Kobayashi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuji","surname":"Oh-ishi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junichi","surname":"Nagasawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Junichi","surname":"Nagasawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kazuto","surname":"Takahashi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hitoshi","surname":"Ishida","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tetsuya","surname":"Izawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hideki","surname":"Ohno","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Hideki","surname":"Ohno","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.2337/diabetes.46.7.1159","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Voluntary

(adiponectin, leptin, resistin and visfatin) in pediatric obesity (6–18 years old).\n\n Fourteen randomized controlled trials (347 youths) were included.\n\n Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95%

homeostasis remains poorly understood.\n\n The FGF21–adiponectin axis participates in the regulation of glucose metabolism.\n\n Elevated levels of FGF21 and decreased levels of adiponectin in obesity indicate FGF21–adiponectin axis dysfunction.\n\n Hence, we investigated whether exercise could improve the FGF21–adiponectin axis impairment and ameliorate disturbed glucose metabolism in diet-induced obese mice.\n\n\nMethods\nEight-week-old C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to three groups: low-fat diet control group, high-fat diet group and high-fat diet plus exercise group.\n\n Glucose metabolic parameters, the ability of FGF21 to induce adiponectin, FGF21 receptors and co-receptor levels and adipose tissue inflammation were evaluated after 12 weeks of intervention.\n\n\nResults\nExercise training led to reduced levels of fasting blood glucose and insulin, improved glucose tolerance and better insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.\n\n Although serum FGF21 levels were not significantly changed, both total and high-molecular-weight adiponectin concentrations were markedly enhanced by exercise.\n\n Importantly, exercise protected against high-fat diet-induced impaired ability of FGF21 to stimulate adiponectin secretion.\n\n FGF21 co-receptor, ?-klotho, as well as receptors, FGFR1 and FGFR2, were upregulated by exercise.\n\n We also found that exercise inhibited adipose tissue inflammation, which may contribute to the improvement in the FGF21–adiponectin axis impairment.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data indicate exercise protects against high-fat diet-induced FGF21–adiponectin axis impairment, and may thereby exert beneficial effects on glucose

to training-induced improvements in glucose homeostasis, subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) from exercise-trained or sedentary donor mice was transplanted into the visceral cavity of sedentary

completely reversed if high-fat–fed recipient mice were transplanted with scWAT from exercise-trained mice.\n In additional experiments, voluntary exercise training by wheel running for only 11 days resulted in profound changes in scWAT, including the increased expression of ?1,550 genes involved in numerous cellular functions including metabolism.\n Exercise training causes adaptations to scWAT

Induces White Adipose Tissue Browning Across the Weight Spectrum in Humans","abstract":"While the effect of exercise on white adipose tissue browning and metabolic improvement in rodents is clear, there are few studies in humans with inconclusive results.\n Thus, the aim of the study was to assess whether an exercise intervention promotes subcutaneous adipose tissue browning in humans, and whether this response is associated with metabolic improvement in three groups of individuals defined by body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2).\n Sedentary adult subjects with different BMI were enrolled in a 12-week bicycle-training program (3 times per week, intensity 70–80% HRmax).\n Brown and beige gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue (scWAT) biopsies, and serum glucose, insulin, lipid, adipokine, and myokine levels were compared before and after the exercise intervention.\n Thirty-three non-diabetic subjects (mean age 30.4 ± 4.6 years; 57.57% female; 13 normal weight, 10 overweight and 10 with obesity) completed the exercise intervention.\n Without any significant change in body composition, exercise improved several metabolic parameters, most notably insulin resistance and particularly in the overweight group.\n Circulating adiponectin, apelin, and irisin exercise-induced changes predicted 60% of the insulin sensitivity improvement.\n After exercise UCP1, TBX1, CPT1B scWAT expression significantly increased, along with P2RX5 significant positive staining.\n These changes are compatible with scWAT browning, however, they were not associated with glucose metabolism improvement.\n In conclusion, 12-weeks of exercise training produced brown/beige gene expression changes in abdominal scWAT of non-diabetic individuals with different BMI, which did not contribute to the metabolic improvement.\n However, this result should not be interpreted as a lack of effect of browning on metabolic parameters.\n These findings suggest that a bigger effect is needed and should not preclude the development of more effective strategies of browning.\n Furthermore, exercise-induced changes in adiponectin, apelin, and irisin predicted insulin sensitivity improvement, supporting the important role of adipokines and myokines in metabolism homeostasis.\n","id":"PMC6297830","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Berenice","surname":"Otero-Díaz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marcela","surname":"Rodríguez-Flores","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Verónica","surname":"Sánchez-Muñoz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fernando","surname":"Monraz-Preciado","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Samuel","surname":"Ordoñez-Ortega","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vicente","surname":"Becerril-Elias","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guillermina","surname":"Baay-Guzmán","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rodolfo","surname":"Obando-Monge","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eduardo","surname":"García-García","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Berenice","surname":"Palacios-González","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"María

era of target-based drug discovery and its molecular mechanism of action remains an area of vigorous diabetes research.\n An improvement in our understanding of metformin’s molecular targets is likely to enable target-based identification of second-generation drugs with similar properties, a development that has been impossible up to now.\n The notion that 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mediates the anti-hyperglycaemic action of metformin has recently been challenged by genetic loss-of-function studies, thrusting the AMPK-independent effects of the drug into the spotlight for the first time in more than a decade.\n Key AMPK-independent effects of the drug include the mitochondrial actions that have been known for many years and which are still thought to be the primary site of action of metformin.\n Coupled with recent evidence of AMPK-independent effects on the counter-regulatory hormone glucagon, new paradigms of AMPK-independent drug action are beginning to take shape.\n In this review we summarise the recent research developments on the molecular action of metformin.\n","id":"PMC3737434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Graham","surname":"Rena","email":"g.rena@dundee.ac.uk","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ewan

beneficial effect on body weight and body composition, although the precise mechanism has not been elucidated yet.\n\n The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of metformin on energy metabolism and anthropometric factors in both human subjects and rats.\n\n\nMethods\nIn human studies, metformin (1500mg/day) was administered to 23 healthy subjects and 18 patients with type 2 diabetes for 2 weeks.\n\n Metabolic parameters and energy metabolism were measured during a meal tolerance test in the morning before and after the treatment of metformin.\n\n In animal studies, 13 weeks old SD rats were fed 25–26 g of standard chow only during 12-hours dark phase with either treated by metformin (2.5mg/ml in drinking water) or not for 2 weeks, and metabolic parameters, anthropometric factors and energy metabolism together with expressions related to fat oxidation and adaptive thermogenesis were measured either in fasting or post-prandial state at 15 weeks old.\n\n\nResults\nPost-prandial plasma lactate concentration was significantly increased after the metformin treatment in both healthy subjects and diabetic patients.\n\n Although energy expenditure (EE) did not change, baseline respiratory quotient (RQ) was significantly decreased and post-prandial RQ was significantly increased vice versa following the metformin treatment in both groups.\n\n By the administration of metformin to SD rats for 2 weeks, plasma levels of lactate and pyruvate were significantly increased in both fasting and post-prandial states.\n\n RQ during a fasting state was significantly decreased in metformin-treated rats compared to controls with no effect on EE.\n\n Metformin treatment brought about a significant reduction of visceral fat mass compared to controls accompanied by an up-regulation of fat oxidation-related enzyme in the liver, UCP-1 in the brown adipose tissue and UCP-3 in the skeletal muscle.\n\n\nConclusion\nFrom the results obtained, beneficial effects of metformin on visceral fat reduction has been demonstrated probably through a mechanism for a potential shift of fuel resource into fat oxidation and an upregulation of adaptive thermogenesis independent of an anorexigenic effect of this drug.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5291441","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ichiro","surname":"Tokubuchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuji","surname":"Tajiri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shimpei","surname":"Iwata","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kento","surname":"Hara","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nobuhiko","surname":"Wada","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Toshihiko","surname":"Hashinaga","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hitomi","surname":"Nakayama","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hiroharu","surname":"Mifune","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kentaro","surname":"Yamada","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.

first-line oral anti-diabetic drug, metformin, should be initiated to a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) early in the course of management in addition to lifestyle modifications.\n\n This study aims to evaluate the net effects of metformin monotherapy (MM) on the all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.\n\n\nMethods\nA retrospective 5-year follow-up cohort study was conducted on Chinese adult patients with T2DM and without any CVD history under public primary care.\n\n Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed to compare the risk of all-cause mortality

glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activity selectively in the LH can profoundly affect food reward behavior, ultimately leading to obesity.\n Progressive ratio operant responding for sucrose was examined in male and female rats, following GLP-1R activation and pharmacological or genetic GLP-1R blockade in the LH.\n Ingestive behavior and metabolic parameters, as well as molecular and efferent targets, of the LH GLP-1R activation were also evaluated.\n Food motivation was reduced by activation of LH GLP-1R.\n Conversely, acute pharmacological blockade of LH GLP-1R increased food motivation but only in male rats.\n GLP-1R activation also induced a robust reduction in food intake and body weight.\n Chronic knockdown of LH GLP-1R induced by intraparenchymal delivery of an adeno-associated virus-short hairpin RNA construct was sufficient to markedly and persistently elevate ingestive behavior and body weight and ultimately resulted in a doubling of fat mass in males and females.\n Interestingly, increased food reinforcement was again found only in males.\n Our data identify the LH GLP-1R as an indispensable element of normal food reinforcement, food intake and body weight regulation.\n These findings also show, for we believe the first time, that brain GLP-1R manipulation can result in a robust and chronic body weight gain.\n The broader implications of these findings are that the LH differs between females and males in its ability to control motivated and ingestive behaviors.\n","id":"PMC5984105","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"L","surname":"López-Ferreras","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J

additional important contributor to CVD risk in T2DM.\n Multiple lipid lowering medications effectively reduce fasting LDL cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations and several of them routinely reduce CVD risk.\n However, in contemporary Western societies the vasculature is commonly exposed to prolonged postprandial hyperlipidemia.\n Metabolism of these postprandial carbohydrates and lipids yields multiple proatherogenic products.\n Even a transient increase in these factors may worsen vascular function and induces impaired endothelial dependent vasodilatation, a predictor of atherosclerosis and future cardiovascular events.\n There is a recent increased appreciation for the role of gut-derived incretin hormones in controlling the postprandial metabolic milieu.\n Incretin-based medications have been developed and are now used to control postprandial hyperglycemia in T2DM.\n Recent data indicate that these medications may also have profound effects on postprandial lipid metabolism and may favorably influence several cardiovascular functions.\n This review discusses (1) the postprandial state with special emphasis on postprandial lipid metabolism and its role in endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk, (2) the ability of incretins to modulate postprandial hyperlipidemia and (3) the potential of incretin-based therapeutic strategies to

Key secondary end points were changes from baseline in weight and mean daily glucose (MDG) at week 24.\nRESULTS\nAt week 24, adjusted mean (SE) changes from baseline in HbA1c were ?0.17% (0.05) for placebo vs.\n\n ?0.82% (0.05) and ?0.77% (0.05) for empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively (both P &lt; 0.001).\n\n Empagliflozin significantly reduced MDG, weight, and systolic (but not diastolic) blood pressure versus placebo.\n\n Adverse events were reported in 62.7, 67.9, and 64.1% of patients on placebo and empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively.\n\n Events consistent with urinary tract infection were reported in 8.0, 10.3, and 8.3% of patients on placebo and empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively (females: 13.3, 18.0, and 17.5%, respectively; males: 2.7, 2.7, and 0%, respectively).\n\n Events consistent with genital infection were reported in 0.9, 2.7, and 2.3% of patients on placebo and empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively (females: 0.9, 4.5, and 3.9%, respectively; males: 0.9% in each group).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEmpagliflozin 10 and 25 mg for 24 weeks as add-on to metformin plus sulfonylurea improved glycemic control, weight, and systolic blood pressure and were well tolerated.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3816918","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hans-Ulrich","surname":"Häring","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ludwig","surname":"Merker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elke","surname":"Seewaldt-Becker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Weimer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Meinicke","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hans J.","surname":"Woerle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Uli C.","surname":"Broedl","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/dom.12188","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Empagliflozin improves glycaemic and weight control as add-on therapy to pioglitazone or pioglitazone plus metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes: A 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2337/dc13-3055","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Improved glucose control with weight loss, lower insulin doses, and no increased hypoglycemia with empagliflozin added to titrated multiple daily injections of insulin in obese inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.05.028","date":"2017-05-25","title":"SGLT2 Inhibition by Empagliflozin Promotes Fat Utilization and Browning and Attenuates Inflammation and Insulin Resistance by Polarizing M2 Macrophages in Diet-induced Obese Mice","abstract":"Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion (UGE), leading to blood glucose reductions and weight loss.\n However, the impacts of SGLT2 inhibition on energy homeostasis and obesity-induced insulin resistance are less well known.\n Here, we show that empagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, enhanced energy expenditure and attenuated inflammation and insulin resistance in high-fat-diet-induced obese (DIO) mice.\n C57BL/6J mice were pair-fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a HFD with empagliflozin for 16 weeks.\n Empagliflozin administration increased UGE in the DIO mice, whereas it suppressed HFD-induced weight gain, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis.\n Moreover, empagliflozin shifted energy metabolism towards fat utilization, elevated AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carbolxylase phosphorylation in skeletal muscle, and increased hepatic and plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 levels.\n Importantly, empagliflozin increased energy expenditure, heat production, and the expression of uncoupling protein 1 in brown fat and in inguinal and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT).\n Furthermore, empagliflozin reduced M1-polarized macrophage accumulation while inducing the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype of macrophages within WAT and liver, lowering plasma TNF?

pathophysiological cues","abstract":"White adipose tissue (WAT) has key metabolic and endocrine functions and plays a role in regulating energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.\n WAT is characterised by its capacity to adapt and expand in response to surplus energy through processes of adipocyte hypertrophy and/or recruitment and proliferation of precursor cells in combination with vascular and extracellular matrix remodelling.\n However, in the context of sustained obesity, WAT undergoes fibro-inflammation, which compromises its functionality, contributing to increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\n Conversely, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and browning of WAT represent potential therapeutic approaches, since dysfunctional white adipocyte-induced lipid overspill can be halted by BAT/browning-mediated oxidative anti-lipotoxic effects.\n Better understanding of the cellular and molecular pathophysiological mechanisms regulating adipocyte size, number and depot-dependent expansion has become a focus of interest over recent decades.\n Here, we summarise the mechanisms contributing to adipose tissue (AT) plasticity and function including characteristics and cellular complexity of the various adipose depots and we discuss recent insights into AT origins, identification of adipose precursors, pathophysiological regulation of

cholesterol: a meta-analysis of data from 170?000 participants in 26 randomised trials","abstract":"Background\nLowering of LDL cholesterol with standard statin regimens reduces the risk of occlusive vascular events in a wide range of individuals.\n\n We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol with statin therapy.\n\n\nMethods\nWe undertook meta-analyses of individual participant data from randomised trials involving at least 1000 participants and at least 2 years' treatment duration of more versus less intensive statin regimens (five trials; 39?612 individuals; median follow-up 5·1 years) and of statin versus control (21 trials; 129?526 individuals; median follow-up 4·8 years).\n\n For each type of trial, we calculated not only the average risk reduction, but also the average risk reduction per 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction at 1 year after randomisation.\n\n\nFindings\nIn the trials of more versus less intensive statin therapy, the weighted mean further reduction in LDL cholesterol at 1 year was 0·51 mmol/L.\n\n Compared with less intensive regimens, more intensive regimens produced a highly significant 15% (95% CI 11–18; p&lt;0·0001) further reduction in major vascular events, consisting of separately significant reductions in coronary death or non-fatal myocardial infarction of 13% (95% CI 7–19; p&lt;0·0001), in coronary revascularisation of 19% (95% CI 15–24; p&lt;0·0001), and in ischaemic stroke of 16% (95% CI 5–26; p=0·005).\n\n Per 1·0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, these further reductions in risk were similar to the proportional reductions in the trials of statin versus control.\n\n When both types of trial were combined, similar proportional reductions in major vascular events per 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction were found in all types of patient studied (rate ratio [RR] 0·78, 95% CI 0·76–0·80; p&lt;0·0001), including those with LDL cholesterol lower than 2 mmol/L on the less intensive or control regimen.\n\n Across all 26 trials, all-cause mortality was reduced by 10% per 1·0 mmol/L LDL reduction (RR 0·90, 95% CI 0·87–0·93; p&lt;0·0001), largely reflecting significant reductions in deaths due to coronary heart disease (RR 0·80, 99% CI 0·74–0·87; p&lt;0·0001) and other cardiac causes (RR 0·89, 99% CI 0·81–0·98; p=0·002), with no significant effect on deaths due to stroke (RR 0·96, 95% CI 0·84–1·09; p=0·5) or other vascular causes (RR 0·98, 99% CI 0·81–1·18; p=0·8).\n\n No significant effects were observed on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes (RR 0·97, 95% CI 0·92–1·03; p=0·3) or on cancer incidence (RR 1·00, 95% CI 0·96–1·04; p=0·9), even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations.\n\n\nInterpretation\nFurther reductions in LDL cholesterol safely produce definite further reductions in the incidence of heart attack, of revascularisation, and of ischaemic stroke, with each 1·0 mmol/L reduction reducing the annual rate of these major vascular events by just over a fifth.\n\n There was no evidence of any threshold within the cholesterol range studied, suggesting that reduction of LDL cholesterol by 2–3 mmol/L would reduce risk by about 40–50%.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Medical Research Council, British Heart Foundation, European Community Biomed Programme, Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, and

maintaining host homeostasis.\n The consumption of a high-fat (HF) diet has been shown to induce gut dysbiosis and reduce intestinal integrity.\n Recent studies have revealed that dysbiosis contributes to the progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) by promoting two major CVD risk factors—atherosclerosis and hypertension.\n Imbalances in host–microbial interaction impair homeostatic mechanisms that regulate health and can activate multiple pathways leading to CVD risk factor progression.\n Dysbiosis has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis through metabolism-independent and metabolite-dependent pathways.\n This review will illustrate how these pathways contribute to the various stages of atherosclerotic plaque progression.\n In addition, dysbiosis can promote hypertension through vascular fibrosis and an alteration of vascular tone.\n As CVD is the number one cause of death globally, investigating the gut microbiota as a locus of

activity in human serum is associated with the components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in type 1 diabetic patients with various degrees of kidney disease and patients with IgA glomerulonephritis (IgAGN).\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nSerum LPS activity was determined with the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate chromogenic end point assay in type 1 diabetic patients with a normal albumin excretion rate (n = 587), microalbuminuria (n = 144), macroalbuminuria (n = 173); patients with IgAGN (n = 98); and in nondiabetic control subjects (n = 345).\n\n The relationships of the LPS/HDL ratio and MetS-associated variables were evaluated with Pearson correlation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe MetS was more prevalent in type 1 diabetic patients (48%) than in patients with IgAGN (15%).\n\n Diabetic patients with macroalbuminuria had a significantly higher serum LPS/HDL ratio than patients with IgAGN.\n\n In the normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetic group, patients in the highest LPS/HDL quartile were

the epidemic development of the disease.\n\n In addition to evidence showing that a specific gut microbiota characterizes patients with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hepatic steatosis, the mechanisms causal to the disease could be related to the translocation of microbiota from the gut to the tissues, inducing inflammation.\n\n The mechanisms regulating such a process are based on the crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the host immune system.\n\n The hologenome theory of evolution supports this concept and implies that therapeutic strategies aiming to control glycemia should take into account both the gut microbiota and the host immune system.\n\n\nScope of review\nThis review discusses the latest evidence regarding the bidirectional impact of the gut microbiota on host immune system crosstalk for the control of metabolic disease, hyperglycemia, and obesity.\n\n To avoid redundancies with the literature, we will focus our attention on the intestinal immune system, identifying evidence for the generation of novel therapeutic strategies, which could be based on the control of the translocation of gut bacteria to tissues.\n\n Such novel strategies should hamper the role played by gut microbiota dysbiosis on the development of metabolic inflammation.\n\n\nMajor conclusions\nRecent evidence in rodents allows us to conclude that an impaired intestinal immune

obesity from 1975 to 2016: a pooled analysis of 2416 population-based measurement studies in 128·9 million children, adolescents, and adults","abstract":"Background\nUnderweight, overweight, and obesity in childhood and adolescence are associated with adverse health consequences throughout the life-course.\n\n Our aim was to estimate worldwide trends in mean body-mass index (BMI) and a comprehensive set of BMI categories that cover underweight to obesity in children and adolescents, and to compare trends with those of adults.\n\n\nMethods\nWe pooled 2416 population-based studies with measurements of height and weight on 128·9 million participants aged 5 years and older, including 31·5 million aged 5–19 years.\n\n We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2016 in 200 countries for mean BMI and for prevalence of BMI in the following categories for children and adolescents aged 5–19 years: more than 2 SD below the median of the WHO growth reference for children and adolescents (referred to as moderate and severe underweight hereafter), 2 SD to more than 1 SD below the median (mild underweight), 1 SD below the median to 1 SD above the median (healthy weight), more than 1 SD to 2 SD above the median (overweight but not obese), and more than 2 SD above the median (obesity).\n\n\nFindings\nRegional change in age-standardised mean BMI in girls from 1975 to 2016 ranged from virtually no change (?0·01 kg/m2 per decade; 95% credible interval ?0·42 to 0·39, posterior probability [PP] of the observed decrease being a true decrease=0·5098) in eastern Europe to an increase of 1·00 kg/m2 per decade (0·69–1·35, PP&gt;0·9999) in central Latin America and an increase of 0·95 kg/m2 per decade (0·64–1·25, PP&gt;0·9999) in Polynesia and Micronesia.\n\n The range for boys was from a non-significant increase of 0·09 kg/m2 per decade (?0·33 to 0·49, PP=0·6926) in eastern Europe to an increase of 0·77 kg/m2 per decade (0·50–1·06, PP&gt;0·9999) in Polynesia and Micronesia.\n\n Trends in mean BMI have recently flattened in northwestern Europe and the high-income English-speaking and Asia-Pacific regions for both sexes, southwestern Europe for boys, and central and Andean Latin America for girls.\n\n By contrast, the rise in BMI has accelerated in east and south Asia for both sexes, and southeast Asia for boys.\n\n Global age-standardised prevalence of obesity increased from 0·7% (0·4–1·2) in 1975 to 5·6% (4·8–6·5) in 2016 in girls, and from 0·9% (0·5–1·3) in 1975 to 7·8% (6·7–9·1) in 2016 in boys; the prevalence of moderate and severe underweight decreased from 9·2% (6·0–12·9) in 1975 to 8·4% (6·8–10·1) in 2016 in girls and from 14·8% (10·4–19·5) in 1975 to 12·4% (10·3–14·5) in 2016 in boys.\n\n Prevalence of moderate and severe underweight was highest in India, at 22·7% (16·7–29·6) among girls and 30·7% (23·5–38·0) among boys.\n\n Prevalence of obesity was more than 30% in girls in Nauru, the Cook Islands, and Palau; and boys in the Cook Islands, Nauru, Palau, Niue, and American Samoa in 2016. Prevalence of obesity was about 20% or more in several countries in Polynesia and Micronesia, the Middle East and north Africa, the Caribbean, and the USA.\n\n In 2016, 75 (44–117) million girls and 117 (70–178) million boys worldwide were moderately or severely underweight.\n\n In the same year, 50 (24–89) million girls and 74 (39–125) million boys worldwide were obese.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe rising trends in children's and adolescents' BMI have plateaued in many high-income countries, albeit at high levels, but have accelerated in parts of Asia, with trends no longer correlated with those of adults.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, AstraZeneca Young Health

altered immune response are important components of obesity and contribute greatly to the promotion of obesity-related metabolic complications, especially cancer development.\n Adipose tissue expansion is associated with increased infiltration of various types of immune cells from both the innate and adaptive immune systems.\n Thus, adipocytes and infiltrating immune cells secrete pro-inflammatory adipokines and cytokines providing a microenvironment favorable for tumor growth.\n Accumulation of B and T cells in adipose tissue precedes macrophage infiltration causing a chronic low-grade inflammation.\n Phenotypic switching toward M1 macrophages and Th1 T cells constitutes an important mechanism described in the obese state correlating with increased tumor growth risk.\n Other possible synergic mechanisms causing a dysfunctional adipose tissue include fatty acid-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and hypoxia.\n Recent investigations have started to unravel the intricacy of the cross-talk between tumor cell/immune cell/adipocyte.\n In this sense, future therapies should take into account the combination of anti-inflammatory

shown to be reduced in obesity, in relation to an increase in inflammation.\n The aim of the present work was to assess the effect of leptin replacement on adiponectin levels and expression as well as

adiponectin (P?&lt;?0.001), reduced circulating 8-isoprostane and serum amyloid A (SAA) levels (P?&lt;?0.05 for both), and significantly downregulated the increased gene expression of osteopontin

subutnit Nox2 expression was determined by Western-blot.\n The proliferative responses to Ang II were evaluated through enzymatic methods.\n Results.\n Leptin inhibited the Ang II-induced proliferative response of VSMCs from control rats.\n This inhibitory effect of leptin was abolished by NOS inhibitor, NMMA, and iNOS selective inhibitor, L-NIL, and was not observed in leptin receptor-deficient fa/fa rats.\n SHR showed increased serum leptin concentrations and lipid peroxidation.\n Despite a similar leptin-induced iNOS up-regulation, VSMCs from SHR showed an impaired NOS activity and NO production induced by leptin, and an increased basal Nox2 expression.\n The inhibitory effect of leptin on Ang II-induced VSMC proliferation was attenuated.\n Conclusion.\n Leptin blocks the proliferative response to Ang II through NO-dependent mechanisms.\n The attenuation of this inhibitory effect of leptin in spontaneous hypertension appears to be due to a reduced NO

highlighted to focus on the increasing recognition that AGT exerts effects beyond being a sole provider of angiotensin

Epidemiological and genetic studies indicate that increased resistin levels are associated with the development of insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n Resistin also appears to mediate the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by promoting endothelial dysfunction, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, arterial inflammation, and the formation of foam cells.\n Thus, resistin is predictive of atherosclerosis and poor clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease and heart failure.\n Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that resistin is associated with atherogenic

investigate the potential role of ghrelin isoforms in the resolution of hepatic steatosis after sleeve gastrectomy, a restrictive bariatric surgery procedure, in diet-induced obese rats.\n Male Wistar rats (n?=?161) were subjected to surgical (sham operation and sleeve gastrectomy) or dietary interventions [fed ad libitum a normal (ND) or a high-fat (HFD) diet or pair-fed].\n Obese rats developed hepatosteatosis and showed decreased circulating desacyl ghrelin without changes in acylated ghrelin.\n Sleeve gastrectomy induced a dramatic decrease of desacyl ghrelin, but increased the acylated/desacyl ghrelin ratio.\n Moreover, sleeve gastrectomy reduced hepatic triglyceride content and lipogenic enzymes Mogat2 and Dgat1, increased mitochondrial DNA amount and induced AMPK-activated mitochondrial FFA ?-oxidation and autophagy to a higher extent than caloric restriction.\n In primary rat hepatocytes, the incubation with both acylated and desacyl ghrelin (10, 100 and

Activity in Conditions of Extreme Body Mass Index","abstract":"FNDC5/irisin has been recently postulated as beneficial in the treatment of obesity and diabetes because it is induced in muscle by exercise, increasing energy expenditure.\n However, recent reports have shown that WAT also secretes irisin and that circulating irisin is elevated in obese subjects.\n The aim of this study was to evaluate irisin levels in conditions of extreme BMI and its correlation with basal metabolism and daily activity.\n The study involved 145 female patients, including 96 with extreme BMIs (30 anorexic (AN) and 66 obese (OB)) and 49 healthy normal weight (NW).\n The plasma irisin levels were significantly elevated in the OB patients compared with the AN and NW patients.\n Irisin also correlated positively with body weight, BMI, and fat mass.\n The OB patients exhibited the highest REE and higher daily physical activity compared with the AN patients but lower activity compared with the NW patients.\n The irisin levels were inversely correlated with daily physical activity and directly correlated with REE.\n Fat mass contributed to most of the variability of the irisin plasma levels independently of the other studied parameters.\n Conclusion.\n Irisin levels are influenced by energy expenditure independently of daily physical activity but fat mass is the main contributing factor.\n","id":"PMC4016898","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"María","surname":"Pardo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ana

awareness of the bored self","abstract":"Research indicates that being bored affectively marks an appraised lack of meaning in the present situation and in life.\n We propose that state boredom increases eating in an attempt to distract from this experience, especially among people high in objective self-awareness.\n Three studies were conducted to investigate boredom’s effects on eating, both naturally occurring in a diary study and manipulated in two experiments.\n In Study 1, a week-long diary study showed that state boredom positively predicted calorie, fat, carbohydrate, and protein consumption.\n In Study 2, a high (vs.\n low) boredom task increased the desire to snack as opposed to eating something healthy, especially amongst those participants high in objective self-awareness.\n In addition, Study 3 demonstrated that among people high in objective self-awareness, high (vs.\n low) boredom increased the consumption of less healthy foods and the consumption of more exciting, healthy foods.\n However, this did not extend to unexciting, healthy food.\n Collectively, these novel findings signify the role of boredom in predicting maladaptive and adaptive eating behaviors as a function of the need to distant from the experience of boredom.\n Further, our results suggest that more exciting, healthy food serves as alternative to maladaptive consumption following boredom.\n","id":"PMC4381486","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Andrew

inflammatory and debilitating skin disorder.\n The exacerbating factors of HS include nutrition and adiposity.\n We aimed to investigate the relationships between body composition and the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) with the severity of HS in a sample of naive-treatment patients with HS.\n In this case–controlled, cross-sectional study, we enrolled 41 HS patients and 41 control subjects.\n Body composition was evaluated by a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) phase-sensitive system.\n PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) and the 7-day food records were used to evaluate the degree of adherence to the MD and dietary pattern, respectively.\n The clinical severity was assessed by using the Sartorius HS score.\n HS patients had a worse body composition, in particular lower phase angle (PhA) (p &lt; 0.001), and a lower adherence to the MD than controls, in spite of no differences in energy intake between the two groups.\n The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis showing a value of PhA of ? 5.7 and a PREDIMED score of ? 5.0 identified HS patients with the highest clinical severity of the disease.\n After adjusting for sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and total energy intake, the HS Sartorius score maintained negative correlations with PhA (p &lt; 0.001), PREDIMED score, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (p = 0.005).\n The results of the multivariate analysis showed PhA and PREDIMED score were the major determinants of HS Sartorius score, explaining 82.0% and 30.4% of its variability, respectively (p &lt; 0.001).\n Novel associations were demonstrated between PhA and the degree of adherence to the MD with the HS severity.\n PhA and PREDIMED score might represent possible markers of severity of HS in a clinical

folliculopilosebaceous unit, followed by follicular rupture, and immune responses (perifollicular lympho-histiocytic inflammation), finally leading to the development of clinical HS lesions.\n HS has a destructive impact on the patient’s quality of life, being a very challenging disease.\n Available treatments are limited, mostly off-label and with high variability in the reported efficacy.\n Fortunately, a monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor alpha has been recently approved for treatment of moderate to severe HS, offering patients a promising new option.\n This review

driven by environmental factors, show multiple bidirectional associations, with important metabolic implications in psoriatic patients.\n\n Besides body mass index (BMI) as a measure of obesity, data on phase angle (PhA), a direct measure by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), used as a marker of cellular health and a predictor of morbidity and mortality in various diseases, are still lacking in psoriasis.\n\n In this case–control, cross-sectional study, we investigated the PhA in 180 pairs of adult psoriatic patients and healthy controls, evaluating also the potential use of the PhA as marker of the clinical severity, the quality of life, and the presence of the MetS in psoriatic patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAnthropometric measures, metabolic profile and bioelectrical variables were evaluated.\n\n The clinical severity was assessed by standardized psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score and c-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and the quality of life was evaluated by dermatology life quality index (DLQI).\n\n MetS was diagnosed according to Adult Treatment Panel III.\n\n\nResults\nPsoriatic patients presented smaller PhA (p &lt; 0.001) and higher prevalence MetS

nutrients on the development of psoriasis.\n\n However, only few studies have investigated the effect of a healthy eating pattern, such as the Mediterranean diet.\n\n In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet, the body composition and the severity of psoriasis in a group of naïve-treatment patients with psoriasis.\n\n\nMethods\nThis is a cross-sectional case–control observational study.\n\n Sixty-two patients (49 males and 13 females, mean age: 50.2±10.5yrs) affected with mild-to-severe psoriasis were consecutively enrolled.\n\n Sixty-two age-, sex- and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy subjects served as control group.\n\n A validated 14-item questionnaire (PREDIMED: PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) was used for the assessment of adherence to the Mediterranean diet.\n\n The severity of psoriasis was by assessed by standardized Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.\n\n Body composition was analyzed with bioelectrical impedance analysis.\n\n\nResults\nA higher percentage of psoriatic patients had a lower PREDIMED score compared to the control group (30.6% vs 4.8%).\n\n PASI score was significantly associated with the percentage of fat mass (FM%) and CRP levels.\n\n PASI score and CRP levels were significantly associated with the dietary components

question is which individual items of such a brief tool are responsible for this association.\n\n We examined these associations using a 14-item tool of adherence to the Mediterranean diet as exposure and body mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) as outcomes.\n\n\nDesign\nCross-sectional assessment of all participants in the “PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea” (PREDIMED)

(MD) has shown to prevent bone disease.\n\n Aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between bone health status and adherence the MD.\n\n\nMethods\nFour-hundred eighteen healthy people (105 males and 313 females, age 50 ± 14 years) were recruited in the outdoor hospital of the “Campus Salute Onlus” held in Piazza del Plebiscito in Naples, October 17–20th 2013 and 09–11th October 2014. All subjects underwent clinical assessment, calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS) scanner and PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire.\n\n\nResults\nGlobally, prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia were 7.7 and 46.0%, respectively.\n\n The majority of subjects (60.5%) had an average score (score 6–9) of adherence to MD.\n\n The T-score showed positive correlation with PREDIMED score (r = 0.250, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n The higher T-scores were positively associated with a higher consumption of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), vegetables, fruits, legumes, and fish and negatively associated with consumption of red meat.\n\n The higher T-scores were positively associated with the highest odds of PREDIMED scores (higher adherence) (OR 6.91, IC 6.27–7.61, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Multiple regression analysis models indicated that, among the single food items investigated, high T-score can be predicted by consumption of EVOO (p &lt; 0.001), fish (p &lt; 0.001) and fruit (p = 0.002) intake.\n\n A PREDIMED score of 3 was found to be predictive for a low T-score (? = 0.05, R-squared index = 0.417).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results demonstrate a positive correlation between bone health status and adherence to MD, suggesting that a high adherence to MD promotes bone health.\n\n The observations here reported confirmed that a specific dietary approach, such as MD, can represent a modifiable environmental factor for osteoporosis’ prevention.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5404307","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria

and cardio-metabolic risk in psoriatic male patients evaluated by 7-day food-frequency questionnaire","abstract":"Background\nWestern dietary pattern is included among the environmental dietary factors involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.\n\n Nutritional data collection methods and gender differences might affect the association between diet and psoriasis.\n\n The 7-day food records is considered the “gold standard” of self-administered food frequency questionnaires.\n\n In this study, we evaluated the differences in the dietary intake, anthropometric measurements and cardio-metabolic risk profile in a group of psoriatic patients compared with an age and Body Mass Index (BMI)-matched control group.\n\n In addition, in the group of psoriatic patients we investigated the association between the dietary intake and clinical severity of psoriasis.\n\n\nMethods\nCross-sectional case control observational study.\n\n A total of 82 adult males, 41 treatment-naïve patients with psoriasis and 41 healthy subjects matched for age and BMI were included in the study.\n\n The clinical severity of psoriasis was by assessed by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score.\n\n The dietary interview data were collected by a 7-day food records.\n\n Anthropometric measures, glucose and lipid profile, liver function tests and C-reactive protein levels were measured.\n\n Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HoMA-IR), Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) and the Fatty Liver Index (FLI) were calculated.\n\n\nResults\nPsoriatic patients consumed a higher percentage of total and simple carbohydrates, total fat, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio, and cholesterol, while the consumption of protein, complex carbohydrates, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), n-3 PUFA and fiber was lower than in the control group.\n\n In addition, psoriatic patients presented altered anthropometric measurements, glucose and lipid profile, liver function tests, and elevated values of HoMA-IR, VAI and FLI.\n\n PASI score well correlated with anthropometric measures, glucose and lipid profile, liver function tests, cardio-metabolic indices, and the dietary components, except for protein and total carbohydrates.\n\n At logistic regression analysis between PASI score and MUFA, MetS presence was well predicted only by higher PASI score (OR = 1.794; p = 0.002; CI 1.242–2.591).\n\n At multiple regression analysis, MUFA was the best predictor of PASI score (r2 = 0.387, ? = ?0.635, t = ?5.127, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nDifferences in dietary intake were observed in adult male psoriatic patients compared with the controls.\n\n These differences were associated to the severity of the psoriasis and cardio-metabolic risk.\n\n FLI represented an early indicator of the cardio-metabolic risk profile in psoriatic patients, and dietary MUFA were major predictor of the clinical severity of psoriasis, while the association between psoriasis and metabolic syndrome appeared to be independent of MUFA intake.\n\n The low MUFA consumption might act as a possible adjunctive mechanism in increasing the inflammation milieu of psoriatic patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4571062","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Luigi","surname":"Barrea","email":"luigi.barrea@unina.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paolo

example, conformity to the Mediterranean diet) is associated with lower obesity risk.\n\n It is unclear whether a brief dietary assessment tool, instead of full-length comprehensive methods, can also capture this association.\n\n In addition to reduced costs, a brief tool has the interesting advantage of allowing immediate feedback to participants in interventional studies.\n\n Another relevant question is which individual items of such a brief tool are responsible for this association.\n\n We examined these associations using a 14-item tool of adherence to the Mediterranean diet as exposure and body mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) as outcomes.\n\n\nDesign\nCross-sectional assessment of all participants in the “PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea” (PREDIMED)

pattern is included among the environmental dietary factors involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.\n\n Nutritional data collection methods and gender differences might affect the association between diet and psoriasis.\n\n The 7-day food records is considered the “gold standard” of self-administered food frequency questionnaires.\n\n In this study, we evaluated the differences in the dietary intake, anthropometric measurements and cardio-metabolic risk profile in a group of psoriatic patients compared with an age and Body Mass Index (BMI)-matched control group.\n\n In addition, in the group of psoriatic patients we investigated the association between the dietary intake and clinical severity of psoriasis.\n\n\nMethods\nCross-sectional case control observational study.\n\n A total of 82 adult males, 41 treatment-naïve patients with psoriasis and 41 healthy subjects matched for age and BMI were included in the study.\n\n The clinical severity of psoriasis was by assessed by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score.\n\n The dietary interview data were collected by a 7-day food records.\n\n Anthropometric measures, glucose and lipid profile, liver function tests and C-reactive protein levels were measured.\n\n Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HoMA-IR), Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) and the Fatty Liver Index (FLI) were calculated.\n\n\nResults\nPsoriatic patients consumed a higher percentage of total and simple carbohydrates, total fat, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio, and cholesterol, while the consumption of protein, complex carbohydrates, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), n-3 PUFA and fiber was lower than in the control group.\n\n In addition, psoriatic patients presented altered anthropometric measurements, glucose and lipid profile, liver function tests, and elevated values of HoMA-IR, VAI and FLI.\n\n PASI score well correlated with anthropometric measures, glucose and lipid profile, liver function tests, cardio-metabolic indices, and the dietary components, except for protein and total carbohydrates.\n\n At logistic regression analysis between PASI score and MUFA, MetS presence was well predicted only by higher PASI score (OR = 1.794; p = 0.002; CI 1.242–2.591).\n\n At multiple regression analysis, MUFA was the best predictor of PASI score (r2 = 0.387, ? = ?0.635, t = ?5.127, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nDifferences in dietary intake were observed in adult male psoriatic patients compared with the controls.\n\n These differences were associated to the severity of the psoriasis and cardio-metabolic risk.\n\n FLI represented an early indicator of the cardio-metabolic risk profile in psoriatic patients, and dietary MUFA were major predictor of the clinical severity of psoriasis, while the association between psoriasis and metabolic syndrome appeared to be independent of MUFA intake.\n\n The low MUFA consumption might act as a possible adjunctive mechanism in increasing the inflammation milieu of psoriatic

VAI has been proposed as a useful tool for early detection of a condition of cardiometabolic risk before it develops into an overt metabolic syndrome.\n The application of the VAI in particular populations of patients (women with polycystic ovary syndrome, patients with acromegaly, patients with NAFLD/NASH, patients with HCV hepatitis, patients with type 2 diabetes, and general population) has produced interesting results, which have led to the hypothesis that the VAI could be considered a marker of adipose tissue dysfunction.\n Unfortunately, in some cases, on the same patient population, there is conflicting evidence.\n We think that this could be mainly due to a lack of knowledge of the application limits of the index, on the part of various authors, and to having applied the VAI in non-Caucasian populations.\n Future prospective studies could certainly better define the possible usefulness of the VAI as a predictor of cardiometabolic

and waist circumference in a Dutch overweight working population","abstract":"Background\nIn population studies, body mass index (BMI) is generally calculated from self-reported body weight and height.\n\n The self-report of these anthropometrics is known to be biased, resulting in a misclassification of BMI status.\n\n The aim of our study is to evaluate the accuracy of self-reported weight, height and waist circumference among a Dutch overweight (Body Mass Index [BMI] ? 25 kg/m2) working population, and to determine to what extent the accuracy was moderated by sex, age, BMI, socio-economic status (SES) and health-related factors.\n\n\nMethods\nBoth measured and self-reported body weight and body height were collected in 1298 healthy overweight employees (66.6% male; mean age 43.9 ± 8.6 years; mean BMI 29.5 ± 3.4 kg/m2), taking part in the ALIFE@Work project.\n\n Measured and self-reported waist circumferences (WC) were available for a sub-group of 250 overweight subjects (70.4% male; mean age 44.1 ± 9.2 years; mean BMI 29.6 ± 3.0 kg/m2).\n\n Intra Class Correlation (ICC), Cohen's kappa and Bland Altman plots were used for reliability analyses, while linear regression analyses were performed to assess the factors that were (independently) associated with the reliability.\n\n\nResults\nBody weight was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) under-reported on average by 1.4 kg and height significantly (p &lt; 0.001) over-reported by 0.7 cm.\n\n Consequently, BMI was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) under-reported by 0.7 kg/m2.\n\n WC was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) over-reported by 1.1 cm.\n\n Although the self-reporting of anthropometrics was biased, ICC's showed high concordance between measured and self-reported values.\n\n Also, substantial agreement existed between the prevalences of BMI status and increased WC based on measured and self-reported data.\n\n The under-reporting of BMI and body weight was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) affected by measured weight, height, SES and smoking status, and the over-reporting of WC by age, sex and measured WC.\n\n\nConclusion\nResults suggest that self-reported BMI and WC are satisfactorily accurate for the assessment of the prevalence of overweight/obesity and increased WC in a middle-aged overweight working population.\n\n As the accuracy of self-reported anthropometrics is affected by measured weight, height, WC, smoking status and/or SES, results for these subgroups should be interpreted with caution.\n\n Due to the large power of our study, the clinical significance of our statistical significant findings may be limited.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nISRCTN04265725\n","id":"PMC2605752","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Johanna

implications in psoriatic patients.\n\n Besides body mass index (BMI) as a measure of obesity, data on phase angle (PhA), a direct measure by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), used as a marker of cellular health and a predictor of morbidity and mortality in various diseases, are still lacking in psoriasis.\n\n In this case–control, cross-sectional study, we investigated the PhA in 180 pairs of adult psoriatic patients and healthy controls, evaluating also the potential use of the PhA as marker of the clinical severity, the quality of life, and the presence of the MetS in psoriatic patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAnthropometric measures, metabolic profile and bioelectrical variables were evaluated.\n\n The clinical severity was assessed by standardized psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score and c-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and the quality of life was evaluated by dermatology life quality index (DLQI).\n\n MetS was diagnosed according to Adult Treatment Panel III.\n\n\nResults\nPsoriatic patients presented smaller PhA (p &lt; 0.001) and higher prevalence MetS compared with controls.\n\n The PhA was significantly associated with number of parameters of MetS in both groups (p &lt; 0.001).\n\n After adjusting for BMI, this association remained significant in psoriatic patients only (p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Among psoriatic patients, the PhA was the major index value for the diagnosis of MetS (OR 5.87, 95 % CI 5.07–6.79) and was inversely associated with both PASI score and DLQI, independently of BMI (p &lt; 0.001).\n\n At multiple regression analysis, the PhA well predicted the PASI score and DLQI.\n\n Based on ROC curves, the most sensitive and specific cutoffs of PhA to predict the highest PASI score and the lowest DQLI were ?4.8° and ?4.9°, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe reported that psoriatic patients presented small PhAs, with a novel association between PhA, clinical severity, quality of life in psoriatic patients, and MetS.\n\n Further studies are required to validate the PhA’s prognostic ability in assessing the clinical severity and MetS in psoriatic patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4863378","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Luigi","surname":"Barrea","email":"luigi.barrea@unina.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paolo

to generalized involvement.\n Moderate to severe psoriasis (&gt;10% of body surface area) is frequently associated with psoriatic arthritis and metabolic diseases, like abdominal obesity, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease.\n A common genetic background as well as several acquired risk factors links psoriasis to comorbidities.\n From a clinical prespective, the understanding of the patients in the context of these comorbidities is very important to ensure that treatment is tailored to meet the individual patient needs.\n Indeed, some pharmacological treatments may negatively affect cardio-metabolic comorbidities, and have important interactions with drugs that are commonly used to treat them.\n Non-pharmacological intervention such as diet, smoking cessation, and physical exercise could both improve the response to treatments for psoriasis and reduce the cardiovascular

analysis for the assessment of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity","abstract":"Purpose\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate whether bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) can be a suitable technique for the assessment of sarcopenia.\n\n We also investigate the potential use of specific BIVA as an indicator of sarcopenic obesity.\n\n\nSubjects and methods\nThe sample comprised 207 free-living elderly individuals of both sexes, aged 65 to 93 years.\n\n Anthropometric and bioelectrical measurements were taken according to standard criteria.\n\n The “classic” and “specific” BIVA procedures, which respectively correct bioelectrical values for body height and body geometry, were used.\n\n Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used as the reference method for identifying sarcopenic and obese sarcopenic individuals.\n\n Bioelectrical and DXA values were compared using Student’s t-test and Hotelling’s T2 test, as well as Pearson’s correlation coefficient.\n\n\nResults\nAccording to classic BIVA, sarcopenic individuals of both sexes showed higher values of resistance/height (R/H; p &lt; 0.01) and impedance/height (Z/H; p &lt; 0.01), and a lower phase angle (p &lt; 0.01).\n\n Similarly, specific BIVA showed significant differences between sarcopenic and nonsarcopenic individuals (men: T2 = 15.7, p &lt; 0.01; women: T2 = 10.7, p &lt; 0.01), with the sarcopenic groups showing a lower specific reactance and phase angle.\n\n Phase angle was positively correlated with the skeletal muscle mass index (men: r = 0.52, p &lt; 0.01; women: r = 0.31, p &lt; 0.01).\n\n Specific BIVA also recognized bioelectrical differences between sarcopenic and sarcopenic obese men (T2 = 13.4, p &lt; 0.01), mainly due to the higher values of specific R in sarcopenic obese individuals.\n\n\nConclusion\nBIVA detected muscle-mass variations in sarcopenic individuals, and specific BIVA was able to discriminate sarcopenic individuals from sarcopenic obese individuals.\n\n These procedures are promising tools for screening for presarcopenia, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity in routine practice.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3529635","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Elisabetta","surname":"Marini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roberto","surname":"Buffa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Saragat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alessandra","surname":"Coin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elena

disease","abstract":"Aims\nCoV-19/SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic virus that is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths and infected people.\n\n To contain the diffusion of infection, several governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population.\n\n The present commentary briefly analyzes the effects of quarantine on lifestyle, including nutrition and physical activity and the impact of new technologies in dealing with this situation.\n\n\nData synthesis\nQuarantine is associated with stress and depression leading to unhealthy diet and reduced physical activity.\n\n A diet poor in fruit and vegetables is frequent during isolation, with a consequent low intake of antioxidants and vitamins.\n\n However, vitamins have recently been identified as a principal weapon in the fight against the Cov-19 virus.\n\n Some reports suggest that Vitamin D could exert a protective effect on such infection.\n\n During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to encourage adherence to a healthy diet should be implemented.\n\n The WHO has just released guidance for people in self-quarantine, those without any symptoms or diagnosis of acute respiratory illness, which provides practical advice on how to stay active and reduce sedentary behavior while at home.\n\n\nConclusion\nQuarantine carries some long-term effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety.\n\n Following quarantine, a global action supporting healthy diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to a good lifestyle routine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7260516","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anna

and the duty of easy rescue in public health","abstract":"We address the issue of whether, why and under what conditions, quarantine and isolation are morally justified, with a particular focus on measures implemented in the developing world.\n We argue that the benefits of quarantine and isolation justify some level of coercion or compulsion by the state, but that the state should be able to provide the strongest justification possible for implementing such measures.\n While a constrained form of consequentialism might provide a justification for such public health interventions, we argue that a stronger justification is provided by a principle of State Enforced Easy Rescue: a state may permissibly compel individuals to engage in activities that entail a small cost to them but a large benefit to others, because individuals have a moral duty of easy rescue to engage in those activities.\n The principle of State Enforced Easy Rescue gives rise to an Obligation Enforcement Requirement: the state should create the conditions such that submitting to coercive or compulsive measures becomes a fundamental moral duty of individuals, i.\ne.\n a duty of easy rescue.\n When the state can create such conditions, it has the strongest justification possible for implementing coercive or compulsive measures, because individuals have a moral duty to temporarily relinquish the rights that such measures would infringe.\n Our argument has significant implications for how public health emergencies in the developing world should be tackled.\n Where isolation and quarantine measures are necessary, states or the international community have a moral obligation to provide certain benefits to those quarantined or isolated.\n","id":"PMC6001516","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alberto","surname":"Giubilini","email":"alberto.giubilini@philosophy.ox.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Douglas","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Douglas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hannah","surname":"Maslen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julian","surname":"Savulescu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"How

in geriatric research and clinical practice","abstract":"id='Par1'>Life-space mobility (LSM) is a holistic measure of resilience to physical decline and social isolation in later life.\n To promote its use as an outcome in geriatric studies and in clinical practice, this review paper explains the concept of LSM; outlines available questionnaires for LSM assessment, provides an overview of associations between LSM and other outcomes, and discusses emerging methods to measure LSM using wearable sensors.\n Based on performed activity around a central geographical anchor, LSM aims to quantify the observed contraction of daily activities associated with ageing.\n Several questionnaires are available to assess LSM in different contexts: the University of Alabama Life-Space Assessment and the Life-Space Questionnaire (community settings), the Nursing Home Life-Space Diameter (nursing home settings) and Life Space at Home (for house-bound populations).\n Some studies using GPS trackers to calculate life-space parameters reported promising results.\n Although these techniques reduce data collection burden, battery life and older people’s willingness to wear a tracker require further improvement before they can be used more widely.\n Regardless of the assessment method used, LSM was associated with measures of functional and cognitive abilities, nursing home admission and mortality.\n The current availability of instruments, the ongoing development of less burdensome data collection techniques, and evidence of construct validity support a case for promoting integration of LSM assessments into geriatric research studies and clinical practice.\n Ultimately, this will provide a more holistic view on older people’s health and wellbeing.\n","id":"PMC6439151","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joanne

COVID-19 are limited.\n\n\nObjective\nWe sought to evaluate the severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020, to February 5, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model.\n\n Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission.\n\n Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-?), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission.\n\n The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan.\n\n The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period.\n\n Survival analysis revealed that male sex, older age, leukocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19.\nConclusions\nPatients with older age, hypertension, and high lactate dehydrogenase level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19. Severe male patients with heart injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use may have a high risk of death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7152876","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaochen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuyun","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Muqing","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenyu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junqing","surname":"Yue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiguo","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Harald","surname":"Renz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiansheng","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Acute

to Mediterranean Diet and Risk of Cancer: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","abstract":"The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to gain further insight into the effects of adherence to Mediterranean Diet (MedD) on risk of overall cancer mortality, risk of different types of cancer, and cancer mortality and recurrence risk in cancer survivors.\n Literature search was performed using the electronic databases PubMed, and Scopus until 25 August 2017. We included randomized trials (RCTs), cohort (for specific tumors only incidence cases were used) studies, and case-control studies.\n Study-specific risk ratios, hazard ratios, and odds ratios (RR/HR/OR) were pooled using a random effects model.\n Observational studies (cohort and case-control studies), and intervention trials were meta-analyzed separately.\n The updated review process showed 27 studies that were not included in the previous meta-analysis (total number of studies evaluated: 83 studies).\n An overall population of 2,130,753 subjects was included in the present update.\n The highest adherence score to a MedD was inversely associated with a lower risk of cancer mortality (RRcohort: 0.86, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.91, I2 = 82%; n = 14 studies), colorectal cancer (RRobservational: 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.88, I2 = 73%; n = 11 studies), breast cancer (RRRCT: 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.88, n = 1 study) (RRobservational: 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.96, I2 = 22%, n = 16 studies), gastric cancer (RRobservational: 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.86, I2 = 55%; n = 4 studies), liver cancer (RRobservational: 0.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.73, I2 = 0%; n = 2 studies), head and neck cancer (RRobservational: 0.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.66, I2 = 87%; n = 7 studies), and prostate cancer (RRobservational: 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.00, I2 = 0%; n = 6 studies).\n Among cancer survivors, the association between the adherence to the highest MedD category and risk of cancer mortality, and cancer recurrence was not statistically significant.\n Pooled analyses of individual components of the MedD revealed that the protective effects appear to be most attributable to fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n The updated meta-analysis confirms an important inverse association between adherence to a MedD and cancer mortality and risk of several cancer types, especially colorectal cancer.\n These observed beneficial effects are mainly driven by higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n Moreover, we were able to report for the first time a small decrease in breast cancer risk (6%) by pooling seven cohort studies.\n","id":"PMC5691680","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lukas","surname":"Schwingshackl","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carolina","surname":"Schwedhelm","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cecilia","surname":"Galbete","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Georg","surname":"Hoffmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.4838","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Mediterranean

intervention based on this dietary pattern could provide the most definitive answer to the findings reported by observational studies.\n\n The aim of this study was to compare in a randomized trial the effects of two Mediterranean diets versus a low-fat diet on depression risk after at least 3 years of intervention.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a multicenter, randomized, primary prevention field trial of cardiovascular disease (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED Study)) based on community-dwelling men aged 55 to 80 years and women aged 60 to 80 years at high risk of cardiovascular disease (51% of them had type 2 diabetes; DM2) attending primary care centers affiliated with 11 Spanish teaching hospitals.\n\n Primary analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\n Cox regression models were used to assess the relationship between the nutritional intervention groups and the incidence of depression.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 224 new cases of depression during follow-up.\n\n There was an inverse association with depression for participants assigned to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts (multivariate hazard ratio (HR) 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.10) compared with participants assigned to the control group, although this was not significant.\n\n However, when the analysis was restricted to participants with DM2, the magnitude of the effect of the intervention with the Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts did reach statistical significance (multivariate HR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.98).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe result suggest that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts could exert a beneficial effect on the risk of depression in patients with DM2.\nTrial registration\nThis trial has been registered in the Current

inflammatory disease, but where does the inflammation come from?","abstract":"Background\nWe now know that depression is associated with a chronic, low-grade inflammatory response and activation of cell-mediated immunity, as well as activation of the compensatory anti-inflammatory reflex system.\n\n It is similarly accompanied by increased oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&amp;NS), which contribute to neuroprogression in the disorder.\n\n The obvious question this poses is ‘what is the source of this chronic low-grade inflammation?’\nDiscussion\nThis review explores the role of inflammation and oxidative and nitrosative stress as possible mediators of known environmental risk factors in depression, and discusses potential implications of these findings.\n\n A range of factors appear to increase the risk for the development of depression, and seem to be associated with systemic inflammation; these include psychosocial stressors, poor diet, physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, altered gut permeability, atopy, dental cares, sleep and vitamin D deficiency.\n\n\nSummary\nThe identification of known sources of inflammation provides support for inflammation as a mediating pathway to both risk and neuroprogression in depression.\n\n Critically, most of these factors are plastic, and potentially amenable to therapeutic and preventative interventions.\n\n Most, but not all, of the above mentioned sources of inflammation may play a role in other psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3846682","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Berk","email":"mikebe@barwonhealth.org.au","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lana

of protein, fat, and carbohydrate intakes with insomnia symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this cross-sectional analysis of 4435 non-shift workers, macronutrient intakes were assessed by the brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire, which requires the recall of usual intakes of 58 foods during the preceding month.\n\n Presence of insomnia symptoms, including difficulty initiating sleep (DIS), difficulty maintaining sleep (DMS), and poor quality of sleep (PQS) were self-reported.\n\n Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs adjusted for demographic, psychological, and behavioral factors, as well as medical histories.\n\n\nResults\nLow protein intake (&lt;16% vs ?16% of total energy) was associated with DIS (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99–1.56)

with higher morbidity, on diabetes risk.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nA total of 1,741 men and women randomly selected from Central Pennsylvania were studied in the sleep laboratory.\n\n Insomnia was defined by a complaint of insomnia with duration of ?1 year, whereas poor sleep was defined as a complaint of difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or early final awakening.\n\n Polysomnographic sleep duration was classified into three categories: ?6 h of sleep (top 50% of the sample); 5–6 h (approximately third quartile of the sample); and ?5 h (approximately the bottom quartile of the sample).\n\n Diabetes was defined either based on a fasting blood glucose &gt;126 mg/dl or use of medication.\n\n In the logistic regression model, we simultaneously adjusted for age, race, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, depression, sleep-disordered breathing, and periodic limb movement.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChronic insomnia but not poor sleep was associated with a higher risk for diabetes.\n\n Compared with the normal sleeping and ?6 h sleep duration group, the highest risk of diabetes was in individuals with insomnia and ?5 h sleep duration group (odds ratio [95% CI] 2.95 [1.2–7.0]) and in insomniacs who slept 5–6 h (2.07 [0.68–6.4]).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nInsomnia with short sleep duration is associated with increased odds of diabetes.\n\n Objective sleep duration may predict cardiometabolic morbidity of chronic insomnia, the medical impact of which has been underestimated.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2768214","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexandros

cholesterol in humans and animal models, the relationship of saturated fat intake to risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in humans remains controversial.\n A critical question is what macronutrient should be used to replace saturated fat.\n Substituting polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat reduces LDL cholesterol and the total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio.\n However, replacement of saturated fat by carbohydrates, particularly refined carbohydrates and added sugars, increases levels of triglyceride and small LDL particles and reduces high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, effects that are of particular concern in the context of the increased prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance.\n Epidemiologic studies and randomized clinical trials have provided consistent evidence that replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat, but not carbohydrates, is beneficial for coronary heart disease.\n Therefore, dietary recommendations should emphasize substitution of polyunsaturated fat and minimally processed grains for saturated fat.\n","id":"PMC2943062","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Patty

but also mood and cognitive disorders.\n Obese subjects often show deficits in memory, learning and executive functions compared to normal weight subjects.\n Epidemiological studies also indicate that obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing depression and anxiety, and vice versa.\n These associations between pathologies that presumably have different etiologies suggest shared pathological mechanisms.\n Gut microbiota is a mediating factor between the environmental pressures (e.\ng.\n, diet, lifestyle) and host physiology, and its alteration could partly explain the cross-link between those pathologies.\n Westernized dietary patterns are known to be a major cause of the obesity epidemic, which also promotes a dysbiotic drift in the gut microbiota; this, in turn, seems to contribute to obesity-related complications.\n Experimental studies in animal models and, to a lesser extent, in humans suggest that the obesity-associated microbiota may contribute to the endocrine, neurochemical and inflammatory alterations underlying obesity and its comorbidities.\n These include dysregulation of the HPA-axis with overproduction of glucocorticoids, alterations in levels of neuroactive metabolites (e.\ng.\n, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids) and activation of a pro-inflammatory milieu that can cause neuro-inflammation.\n This review updates current

compartment, has been considered not only as a simple energy depository tissue, but also as an active endocrine organ releasing a variety of biologically active molecules known as adipocytokines or adipokines.\n Based on the complex interplay between adipokines, obesity is also characterized by chronic low grade inflammation with permanently increased oxidative stress (OS).\n Over-expression of oxidative stress damages cellular structures together with under-production of anti-oxidant mechanisms, leading to the development of obesity-related complications.\n The aim of this review is to summarize what is known in the relationship between OS in obesity and obesity-related diseases.\n","id":"PMC4307252","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lucia","surname":"Marseglia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sara","surname":"Manti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabriella","surname":"D’Angelo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Nicotera","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eleonora","surname":"Parisi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabriella","surname":"Di

and food intake is a complex process.\n Reward and gratification associated with food consumption leads to dopamine (DA) production, which in turn activates reward and pleasure centers in the brain.\n An individual will repeatedly eat a particular food to experience this positive feeling of gratification.\n This type of repetitive behavior of food intake leads to the activation of brain reward pathways that eventually overrides other signals of satiety and hunger.\n Thus, a gratification habit through a favorable food leads to overeating and morbid obesity.\n Overeating and obesity stems from many biological factors engaging both central and peripheral systems in a bi-directional manner involving mood and emotions.\n Emotional eating and altered mood can also lead to altered food choice and intake leading to overeating and obesity.\n Research findings from human and animal studies support a two-way link between three concepts, mood, food, and obesity.\n The focus of this article is to provide an overview of complex nature of food intake where various biological factors link mood, food intake, and brain signaling that engages both peripheral and central nervous system

in last years as a valuable therapeutic option for obesity and related diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\n The complicated network of mechanisms involved in obesity and T2DM have not completely defined yet.\n There is still a debate on which would be the first metabolic defect leading to metabolic deterioration: insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia? Insight into the metabolic effects of bariatric/metabolic surgery has revealed that, beyond weight loss and food restriction, other mechanisms can be activated by the rearrangements of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the incretinic/anti-incretinic system, changes in bile acid composition and flow, and modifications of gut microbiota; all of them possibly involved in the remission of T2DM.\n The complete elucidation of these mechanisms will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease.\n Our aim was to review some of the metabolic mechanisms involved in the development of T2DM in obese patients as well as in the remission of this condition in patients submitted to bariatric/metabolic

regulation, and dilutes lipid soluble persistent organic pollutants.\n Recent literature shows that this protective role of adipose tissue is more solicited in a modern context in which unsuspected factors can affect energy balance to a much greater extent than what is generally perceived by health care professionals.\n These factors include short sleep duration, demanding mental work, and chemical pollution whose impact is more detectable in a context dominated by economic productivity and competitiveness.\n Since these factors might also include the increase in atmospheric CO2, it is likely that obesity prevention will need the support of a promotion in sustainable development, whether it is for human health, and well-being or global ecological

in the management of obstructive sleep apnoea and cardiovascular disease risk","abstract":"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality.\n It is accepted that OSA and obesity commonly coexist.\n The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends dietary-induced weight loss and exercise as lifestyle treatment options for OSA.\n However, most clinical trials upon which this recommendation is based have focused on establishing the effectiveness of calorie-restricted, often low-fat diets for improving OSA severity, whereas less attention has been given to the means through which weight loss is achieved (e.\ng.\n altered dietary quality) or whether diet or exercise mediates the associations between reduced weight, improved OSA severity and the CVD substrate.\n The current evidence suggests that the benefits of a low-carbohydrate or Mediterranean diet in overweight and obese individuals go beyond the recognised benefits of weight reduction.\n In addition, exercise has an independent protective effect on vascular health, which may counter the increased oxidative stress, inflammation and sympathetic activation that occur in OSA patients.\n This review aims to expand our understanding of the effects of diet and exercise on OSA and associated CVD complications, and sets the stage for continued research designed to explore optimal lifestyle strategies for reducing the CVD burden in OSA

0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nWe found that living in a polluted area plays a significant independent role in vitamin D deficiency and hence, residence can be one of the main reasons of vitamin D status of the women.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2940914","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Farhad","surname":"Hosseinpanah","email":"fhospanah@endocrine.ac.ir","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sima Hashemi","surname":"pour","email":"simahpr@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Motahare","surname":"Heibatollahi","email":"heibatollahi@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nilufar","surname":"Moghbel","email":"nm939nm@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saeed","surname":"Asefzade","email":"sasefzade@qums.ac.ir","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fereidoun","surname":"Azizi","email":"azizi@endocrine.ac.ir","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1210/jc.2012-1943","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Study group.

pollution is a serious worldwide problem due to its impact on human health.\n In the past 60?years, growing evidence established a correlation between exposure to air pollutants and the developing of severe respiratory diseases.\n Recently particulate matter (PM) is drawing more public attention to various aspects including historical backgrounds, physicochemical characteristics, and its pathological role.\n Therefore, this review is focused on these aspects.\n The most famous air pollution disaster happened in London on December 1952; it has been calculated that more than 4,000 deaths occurred during this event.\n Air pollution is a complex mix of gases and particles.\n Gaseous pollutants disseminate deeply into the alveoli, allowing its diffusion through the blood–air barrier to several organs.\n Meanwhile, PM is a mix of solid or liquid particles suspended in the air.\n PM is deposited at different levels of the respiratory tract, depending on its size: coarse particles (PM10) in upper airways and fine particles (PM2.5) can be accumulated in the lung parenchyma, inducing several respiratory diseases.\n Additionally to size, the composition of PM has been associated with different toxicological outcomes on clinical and epidemiological, as well as in vivo and in vitro animal and human studies.\n PM can be constituted by organic, inorganic, and biological compounds.\n All these compounds are capable of modifying several biological activities, including alterations in cytokine production, coagulation factors balance, pulmonary function, respiratory symptoms, and cardiac function.\n It can also generate different modifications during its passage through the airways, like inflammatory cells recruitment, with the release of cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS).\n These inflammatory mediators can activate different pathways, such as MAP kinases, NF-?B, and Stat-1, or induce DNA adducts.\n All these alterations can mediate obstructive or restrictive respiratory diseases like asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and even cancer.\n In 2013, outdoor air pollution was classified as Group 1 by IARC based on all research studies data about air pollution effects.\n Therefore, it is important to understand how PM composition can generate several pulmonary pathologies.\n","id":"PMC4719080","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carlos

is the key component for air pollution, and associated with significant mortality.\n The majority of the mortality following PM exposure is related to cardiovascular diseases.\n However, the mechanisms for the adverse effects of PM exposure on cardiovascular system remain largely unknown and under active investigation.\n Endothelial dysfunction or injury is considered one of the major factors that contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.\n Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a critical role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of vasculature.\n Particulate matter exposure significantly suppressed the number and function of EPCs in animals and humans.\n However, the mechanisms for the detrimental effects of PM on EPCs remain to be fully defined.\n One of the important mechanisms might be related to increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation.\n Bone marrow

Study","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nBecause vitamin D deficiency is associated with a variety of chronic diseases, understanding the characteristics that promote vitamin D deficiency in otherwise healthy adults could have important clinical implications.\n\n Few studies relating vitamin D deficiency to obesity have included direct measures of adiposity.\n\n Furthermore, the degree to which vitamin D is associated with metabolic traits after adjusting for adiposity measures is unclear.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe investigated the relations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations with indexes of cardiometabolic risk in 3,890 nondiabetic individuals; 1,882 had subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volumes measured by multidetector computed tomography (CT).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn multivariable-adjusted regression models, 25(OH)D was inversely associated with winter season, waist circumference, and serum insulin (P &lt; 0.005 for all).\n\n In models further adjusted for CT measures, 25(OH)D was inversely related to SAT (?1.1 ng/ml per SD increment in SAT, P = 0.016) and VAT (?2.3 ng/ml per SD, P &lt; 0.0001).\n\n The association of 25(OH)D with insulin resistance measures became nonsignificant after adjustment for VAT.\n\n Higher adiposity volumes were correlated with lower 25(OH)D across different categories of BMI, including in lean individuals (BMI &lt;25 kg/m2).\n\n The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D &lt;20 ng/ml) was threefold higher in those with high SAT and high VAT than in those with low SAT and low VAT (P &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVitamin D status is strongly associated with variation in subcutaneous and especially visceral adiposity.\n\n The mechanisms by which adiposity promotes vitamin D deficiency warrant further study.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2797928","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joseph

(TNI) is intake from food and supplements.\n\n This provides an assessment of nutrient adequacy and the prevalence of excessive intake, as well as the response with respect to biomarkers.\n\n Cod liver oil (CLO) is the most frequently consumed supplement in the UK, containing nutrients that might have varying influences on health.\n\n We calculated TNI for vitamins A, D and E, as well as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and assessed associations with the respective blood concentrations.\n\n\nMethods\nSeven-day diet diaries and blood samples were taken from two subsets of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC-Norfolk) cohort (age range 39–79 years; n = 1400 for vitamin D; n = 6656 for remaining nutrients).\n\n TNI was calculated for the subgroups: nonsupplement users, those consuming the nutrient in supplement form and those consuming a supplement without this nutrient.\n\n\nResults\nCLO-related nutrients were supplemented by 15%–33%, which approximately doubled median intakes.\n\n Almost everyone in the supplement + vitamin A group reached the estimated average requirement; however, guideline levels were likely to be exceeded.\n\n Partial correlations between intake of vitamins A and D and biomarkers were low and modestly strengthened by the inclusion of supplement sources (correlation = 0.01–0.13).\n\n Correlations between biomarker and TNI of vitamin E and EPA+DHA were in the range 0.40–0.46; however, vitamin E exceeding food intake resulted in attenuated coefficients.\n\n Linear associations between food or TNI EPA+DHA and plasma were weak but consistent across subgroups.\n\n\nConclusions\nCLO-related nutrients contribute substantially to nutrient intake, with a risk of over-consumption.\n\n Apart from EPA+DHA, biomarker data suggest that CLO-related nutrients in supplements are not linearly associated with vitamin

has been hypothesized that the intake of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients may ameliorate various respiratory and cardiovascular effects of air pollution through reductions in oxidative

obesity are two public health problems extensively exacerbated over the last years.\n Among the several mechanisms proposed to account for the complex interplay between vitamin D and obesity, one that has gained particular attention is related to the emerging role of obesity-related changes in gut microbiota and gut-derived metabolites, such as Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO).\n Vitamin D deficiency and high circulating TMAO levels are associated with body weight and the severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n Considering the link of obesity with vitamin D on the one hand and obesity with TMAO on the other hand, and the central role of the liver in both the vitamin D and TMAO metabolism, the aim of this cross-sectional observational study was first, to confirm the possible inverse association between vitamin D and TMAO across different body mass index (BMI) classes and second, to investigate if this association could be influenced by the presence of NAFLD.\n One hundred and four adult subjects (50 males and 54 females; 35.38 ± 7.49 years) were enrolled.\n The fatty liver index (FLI) was used as a proxy for the diagnosis of NAFLD.\n Vitamin D deficiency was found in 65 participants (62.5%), while 33 subjects (31.7%) had insufficient levels, and the remaining subjects had sufficient levels of vitamin D.\n Subjects with both vitamin D deficiency and FLI-NAFLD had the highest TMAO levels (p &lt; 0.001).\n By stratifying the sample population according to the BMI classes, vitamin D levels decreased significantly along with the increase of plasma TMAO concentrations, with the lowest vitamin D levels and highest TMAO, respectively, in class III obesity.\n Vitamin D levels showed significant opposite associations with circulating levels of TMAO (r = ?0.588, p &lt; 0.001), but this association was no longer significant after the adjustment for FLI values.\n The highest values of TMAO were significantly associated with the severity of obesity (OR 7.92; p &lt; 0.001), deficiency of vitamin D (OR 1.62; p &lt; 0.001), and FLI-NAFLD (OR 3.79; p &lt; 0.001).\n The most sensitive and specific cut-off for vitamin D to predict the circulating levels of TMAO was ?19.83 ng/mL (p &lt; 0.001).\n In conclusion, our study suggests that high TMAO levels are associated with vitamin D deficiency and NAFLD.\n Further studies are required to investigate if there is a causality link or whether all of them are simply the consequence of obesity.\n","id":"PMC6627576","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Luigi","surname":"Barrea","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giovanna","surname":"Muscogiuri","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giovanna","surname":"Muscogiuri","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Annunziata","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniela","surname":"Laudisio","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniela","surname":"Laudisio","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Giulia","surname":"de

gene-expression analysis and a wide-variety of other multi-omics approaches, demonstrates an interplay between gut microbiota and the regulation of plasma lipids.\n Gut microbial metabolism of choline and l-carnitine results in the formation of trimethylamine (TMA) and concomitant conversion into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by liver flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3).\n The plasma level of TMAO is determined by the genetic variation, diet and composition of gut microbiota.\n Multiple studies have demonstrated an association between TMAO plasma levels and the risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n We aimed to review the molecular pathways by which TMAO production and FMO3 exert their proatherogenic effects.\n TMAO may promote foam cell formation by upregulating macrophage scavenger receptors, deregulating enterohepatic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism and impairing macrophage reverse cholesterol transport (RCT).\n Furthermore, FMO3 may promote dyslipidemia by regulating multiple genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis.\n FMO3 also impairs multiple aspects of cholesterol homeostasis, including transintestinal cholesterol export and macrophage-specific RCT.\n At least part of these FMO3-mediated effects on lipid metabolism and atherogenesis seem to be independent of the TMA/TMAO formation.\n Overall, these findings have the potential to open a new era for the therapeutic manipulation of the gut microbiota to improve CVD risk.\n","id":"PMC6214130","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marina","surname":"Canyelles","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mireia","surname":"Tondo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lídia","surname":"Cedó","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lídia","surname":"Cedó","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marta","surname":"Farràs","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joan

severity, quality of life and metabolic syndrome","abstract":"Background\nObesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and psoriasis, largely driven by environmental factors, show multiple bidirectional associations, with important metabolic implications in psoriatic patients.\n\n Besides body mass index (BMI) as a measure of obesity, data on phase angle (PhA), a direct measure by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), used as a marker of cellular health and a predictor of morbidity and mortality in various diseases, are still lacking in psoriasis.\n\n In this case–control, cross-sectional study, we investigated the PhA in 180 pairs of adult psoriatic patients and healthy controls, evaluating also the potential use of the PhA as marker of the clinical severity, the quality of life, and the presence of the MetS in psoriatic patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAnthropometric measures, metabolic profile and bioelectrical variables were evaluated.\n\n The clinical severity was assessed by standardized psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score and c-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and the quality of life was evaluated by dermatology life quality index (DLQI).\n\n MetS was diagnosed according to Adult Treatment Panel III.\n\n\nResults\nPsoriatic patients presented smaller PhA (p &lt; 0.001) and higher prevalence MetS compared with controls.\n\n The PhA was significantly associated with number of parameters of MetS in both groups (p &lt; 0.001).\n\n After adjusting for BMI, this association remained significant in psoriatic patients only (p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Among psoriatic patients, the PhA was the major index value for the diagnosis of MetS (OR 5.87, 95 % CI 5.07–6.79) and was inversely associated with both PASI score and DLQI, independently of BMI (p &lt; 0.001).\n\n At multiple regression analysis, the PhA well predicted the PASI score and DLQI.\n\n Based on ROC curves, the most sensitive and specific cutoffs of PhA to predict the highest PASI score and the lowest DQLI were ?4.8° and ?4.9°, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe reported that psoriatic patients presented small PhAs, with a novel association between PhA, clinical severity, quality of life in psoriatic patients, and MetS.\n\n Further studies are required to validate the PhA’s prognostic ability in assessing the clinical severity and MetS in psoriatic patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4863378","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Luigi","surname":"Barrea","email":"luigi.barrea@unina.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paolo

chronic) are likely predicted by blood components, which are reported to be associated with the presence/severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n\n This study was aimed at determining which marker(s) derived from blood count, such as white blood cells, neutrophils, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, platelet count, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, hematocrit values were associated with ear or subclinical atherosclerosis, in obese patients of various classes suffering from NAFLD.\n\n\nMethods\nOne hundred consecutive obese patients presenting NAFLD at ultrasound, with low prevalence of co-morbidities and no history or instrumental features of CV diseases, underwent carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) assessment by Doppler ultrasonography.\n\n All of them were studied taking into account anthropometric parameters, the metabolic profile, and inflammatory markers.\n\n\nResults\nWhite blood cells and neutrophil count showed no statistical association with IMT, which was predicted by the amount of visceral adiposity, as appreciated by ultrasonography.\n\n After adjusting for visceral adiposity and smoking status, only age and hematocrit contextually predicted early atherosclerosis, evaluated as IMT.\n\n Visceral adiposity was a confounding factor in foreseeing IMT.\n\n\nConclusion\nHematocrit values along with the patient’s age suggest an initial atherosclerosis, evaluated as IMT, and if this finding is confirmed in larger cohorts, could be added to other canonical CV risk factors.\n\n Inferences can be enhanced by future prospective studies that aim to identify the relationships between incident cardio-metabolic cases and this hematologic parameter.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5937011","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Giovanni","surname":"Tarantino","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luigi","surname":"Barrea","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Domenico","surname":"Capone","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincenzo","surname":"Citro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Teresa","surname":"Mosca","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Silvia","surname":"Savastano","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1210/jc.2011-0385","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evaluation,

in humans for more than 90 % of the production of vitamin D.\n Among emerging factors influencing sunlight-induced synthesis of vitamin D, prospective and observational studies proved that air pollution constitutes an independent risk factor in the pathogenesis of vitamin D hypovitaminosis.\n In addition, environmental pollutants can affect risk of obesity when inhaled, in combination with unhealthy diet and lifestyle.\n In turn, obesity is closely associated with a low vitamin D status and many possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain this association.\n The associations of air pollution with low vitamin D status on the hand and with obesity on the other hand, could provide a rationale for considering obesity as a further link between air pollution and low vitamin D status.\n In this respect, a vicious cycle could operate among low vitamin D status, air pollution, and obesity, with additive detrimental effects on cardio-metabolic risk in obese individuals.\n Besides vitamin D supplementation, nutrient combination, used to maximize the protective effects against air pollution, might also contribute to improve the vitamin D status by attenuating the “obesogen” effects of air

Biomarker to Quantify Inflammation in Subjects with Obesity and 25(OH)D Deficiency","abstract":"Obesity is associated to chronic low-grade metabolic inflammation and hypovitaminosis D.\n Among extra-skeletal effects, an important role in inflammation has been described for vitamin D (25(OH)D).\n Phase angle (PhA) is a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) parameter that represents an indicator of cellular health in chronic inflammatory states.\n However, it is still unknown whether a low 25(OH)D levels might correlate with PhA in obesity.\n Considering the lack of evidence correlating the 25(OH)D levels with PhA in obesity, the aim of this study was to investigate their possible relationship in a group of patients with obesity stratified according to body mass index (BMI) categories.\n Four hundred and fifty-five adult subjects (219 males and 236 females; 36 ± 11 years) were enrolled.\n Body composition, including PhA, was assessed using a BIA phase-sensitive system.\n Serum levels of 25(OH)D was determined by a direct competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay.\n Most of the participants were affected by grade III obesity (24%) and had 25(OH)D deficiency (67%).\n Subjects with 25(OH)D deficiency had highest BMI (p &lt; 0.001).\n Stratifying the sample population according to the BMI classes, 25(OH)D levels decreased significantly along with the increase in BMI (p &lt; 0.001), with the lowest 25(OH)D levels in the class III obesity.\n In addition, stratifying the sample population according to 25(OH)D categories, BMI and fat mass (FM) decreased, while PhA increased significantly along with the 25(OH)D categories (p &lt; 0.001).\n The 25(OH)D levels showed significant positive associations with PhA (r = ?0.59, p &lt; 0.001), and this association remained significant also after adjusting for BMI and FM (r = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001).\n The lowest values of PhA were significantly associated with the severity of obesity (OR 0.3, p &lt; 0.001) and of 25(OH)D deficiency (OR 0.2, p &lt; 0.001).\n To compare the relative predictive power of body composition parameters associated with the 25(OH)D levels, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis.\n The most sensitive and specific cut-off for 25(OH)D levels to predict the PhA above the median was &gt;14 ng/mL (p &lt; 0.001).\n In conclusion, we provided preliminary insights into a novel link between 25(OH)D levels and PhA in the setting of obesity.\n This association uncovered a new potential usefulness of PhA as expression of cell membrane integrity and predictor of inflammation in low 25(OH)D status that might help in identifying high-risk patients with obesity who could benefit from careful 25(OH)D

New Light on Vitamin D in Obesity: A Novel Association with Trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO)","abstract":"Vitamin D deficiency and obesity are two public health problems extensively exacerbated over the last years.\n Among the several mechanisms proposed to account for the complex interplay between vitamin D and obesity, one that has gained particular attention is related to the emerging role of obesity-related changes in gut microbiota and gut-derived metabolites, such as Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO).\n Vitamin D deficiency and high circulating TMAO levels are associated with body weight and the severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n Considering the link of obesity with vitamin D on the one hand and obesity with TMAO on the other hand, and the central role of the liver in both the vitamin D and TMAO metabolism, the aim of this cross-sectional observational study was first, to confirm the possible inverse association between vitamin D and TMAO across different body mass index (BMI) classes and second, to investigate if this association could be influenced by the presence of NAFLD.\n One hundred and four adult subjects (50 males and 54 females; 35.38 ± 7.49 years) were enrolled.\n The fatty liver index (FLI) was used as a proxy for the diagnosis of NAFLD.\n Vitamin D deficiency was found in 65 participants (62.5%), while 33 subjects (31.7%) had insufficient levels, and the remaining subjects had sufficient levels of vitamin D.\n Subjects with both vitamin D deficiency and FLI-NAFLD had the highest TMAO levels (p &lt; 0.001).\n By stratifying the sample population according to the BMI classes, vitamin D levels decreased significantly along with the increase of plasma TMAO concentrations, with the lowest vitamin D levels and highest TMAO, respectively, in class III obesity.\n Vitamin D levels showed significant opposite associations with circulating levels of TMAO (r = ?0.588, p &lt; 0.001), but this association was no longer significant after the adjustment for FLI values.\n The highest values of TMAO were significantly associated with the severity of obesity (OR 7.92; p &lt; 0.001), deficiency of vitamin D (OR 1.62; p &lt; 0.001), and FLI-NAFLD (OR 3.79; p &lt; 0.001).\n The most sensitive and specific cut-off for vitamin D to predict the circulating levels of TMAO was ?19.83 ng/mL (p &lt; 0.001).\n In conclusion, our study suggests that high TMAO levels are associated with vitamin D deficiency and NAFLD.\n Further studies are required to investigate if there is a causality link or whether all of them are

likely cause is an increased synthesis of vitamin D binding protein (VDBP).\n Discrepant results are reported on whether the use of HC affects free concentrations of vitamin D metabolites.\n Aim: In a cross-sectional study, plasma concentrations of vitamin D metabolites, VDBP, and the calculated free vitamin D index in users and non-users of HC were compared and markers of calcium and bone metabolism investigated.\n Results: 75 Caucasian women aged 25–35 years were included during winter season.\n Compared with non-users (n = 23), users of HC (n = 52) had significantly higher plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) (median 84 interquartile range: [67-111] vs.\n 70 [47-83] nmol/L, p = 0.01), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) (198 [163-241] vs.\n 158 [123-183]

pregnancy","abstract":"Pregnancy represents a dynamic period with physical and physiological changes in both the mother and her developing fetus.\n The dramatic 2–3 fold increase in the active hormone 1,25(OH)2D concentrations during the early weeks of pregnancy despite minimal increased calcium demands during that time of gestation and which are sustained throughout pregnancy in both the mother and fetus suggests an immunomodulatory role in preventing fetal rejection by the mother.\n While there have been numerous observational studies that support the premise of vitamin D's role in maintaining maternal and fetal well-being, until recently, there have been few randomized clinical trials with vitamin D supplementation.\n One has to exhibit caution, however, even with RCTs, whose results can be problematic when analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis and when there is high non-adherence to protocol (as if often the case), thereby diluting the potential good or harm of a given treatment at higher doses.\n As such, a biomarker of a drug or in this case “vitamin” or pre-prohormone is better served.\n For these reasons, the effect of vitamin D therapies using the biomarker circulating 25(OH)D is a far better indicator of true “effect.\n” When pregnancy outcomes are analyzed using the biomarker 25(OH)D instead of treatment dose, there are notable differences in maternal and fetal outcomes across diverse racial/ethnic groups, with improved health in those women who attain a circulating 25(OH)D concentration of at least 100?nmol·L?1 (40?ng·mL?1).\n Because an important issue is the timing or initiation of vitamin D treatment/supplementation, and given the potential effect of vitamin D on placental gene expression and its effects on inflammation within the placenta, it appears crucial to start vitamin D treatment before placentation (and trophoblast invasion); however, this question remains unanswered.\n Additional work is needed to decipher the vitamin D requirements of pregnant women and the optimal timing of supplementation, taking into account a variety of lifestyles, body types, baseline vitamin D status, and maternal and fetal vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) genotypes.\n Determining the role of vitamin D in nonclassical, immune pathways continues to be a challenge that once answered will substantiate recommendations and public health policies.\n","id":"PMC5573964","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Bruce

nutrient-rich maternal diet before and during pregnancy is associated with improved fetal health, more appropriate birth weight, and increased rates of maternal and infant survival.\n\n Physicians need a better understanding of the role of diet in shaping fetal outcomes.\n\n Given this background, we reviewed and summarized articles on maternal nutrition found in MEDLINE since 1981, written in English, and limited to human subjects.\n\n\nFor the Offspring\nMaternal diets high in sugar and fat lead to an increased incidence of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease later in life.\n\n Folic acid should be supplemented prior to conception and continued through at least the first 28 days of fetal life to prevent neural tube defects, and vitamin C should be given to women who smoke to lower the incidence of asthma and wheezing in the children.\n\n Iodine deficiency is increasing, and iodine should be included in prenatal supplements.\n\n If the maternal hemoglobin is 7 g/dL or more, there is no evidence that iron supplementation is needed.\n\n Fish intake during pregnancy is protective against atopic outcomes, whereas high-meat diets contribute to elevated adult blood pressure and hypersecretion of cortisol.\n\n\nFor the Mother\nCalcium supplementation lowers the risk of preeclampsia and hypertensive disease in pregnancy.\n\n\nConclusions\nGiven the limits of our current knowledge, a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and selected fish is desirable for the best outcomes.\n\n Diets high in sugar and fat lead to higher rates of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease.\n\n Folic acid, iodine, and calcium in all pregnant women and vitamin C in smokers are the only supplements so far shown to be of value for routine use.\n\n The physician treating a pregnant woman should be ready to advise a healthy diet for the benefit of the fetus.\n\n\nTarget Audience\nObstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians\nLearning Objectives\nAfter participating in this activity, the obstetricians, gynecologists, and family physicians should be better able to discuss the role of various diets in helping with healthy fetal development; understand the role of diet prior to conception and throughout the pregnancy; and develop knowledge of the role of the maternal diet in affecting the risk for

part, this can be achieved by maintaining muscle mass and strength as people age.\n New evidence suggests that current dietary recommendations for protein intake may be insufficient to achieve this goal and that individuals might benefit by increasing their intake and frequency of consumption of high-quality protein.\n However, the environmental effects of increasing animal-protein production are a concern, and alternative, more sustainable protein sources should be considered.\n Protein is known to be more satiating than other macronutrients, and it is unclear whether diets high in plant proteins affect the appetite of older adults as they should be recommended for individuals at risk of malnutrition.\n The review considers the protein needs of an ageing population (&gt;40 years old), sustainable protein sources, appetite-related implications of diets high in plant proteins, and related areas for future research.\n","id":"PMC5872778","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marta","surname":"Lonnie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emma","surname":"Hooker","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Emma","surname":"Hooker","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeffrey

pregnancy outcomes is more recent.\n This paper critically evaluates the current evidence regarding the effect of dietary GI on maternal and fetal nutrition.\n \nMethods.\n A systematic literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, and ISI Web of Science, from 1980 through September 2010, was conducted.\n \nResults.\n Eight studies were included in the systematic review.\n Two interventional studies suggest that a low-GI diet can reduce the risk of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants in healthy pregnancies, but one epidemiological study reported an increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants.\n Evidence in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), though limited (n = 3), consistently supports the advantages of a low-GI diet.\n \nConclusion.\n There is insufficient evidence to recommend a low-GI diet during normal pregnancy.\n In pregnancy complicated by GDM, a low-GI diet may reduce the need for insulin without adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes.\n Until larger-scale intervention trials are completed, a low-GI diet should not replace the current recommended pregnancy diets from government and health agencies.\n Further research regarding the optimal time to start a low-GI diet for maximum protection against adverse pregnancy outcomes is warranted.\n","id":"PMC3022194","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jimmy Chun Yu","surname":"Louie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jennie

most harmful and it is associated with high rates of long and short term morbidity and mortality for mother and child.\n A variety of adverse pregnancy outcomes are linked with cigarette consumption before and during pregnancy.\n Maternal prenatal cigarette smoke disturbs the equilibrium among the oxidant and antioxidant system, has negative impact on the genetic and cellular level of both mother and fetus and causes a large quantity of diseases in the unborn child.\n These smoking-induced damages for the unborn offspring manifest themselves at various times in life and for most only a very limited range of causal treatment exists.\n Education, support and assistance are of high importance to decrease maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, as there are few other avoidable factors

dietary sources in Spain.\n The purpose was to examine free and intrinsic sugar intake and food and beverage sources.\n The ANIBES Study (Anthropometry, Intake and Energy Balance in Spain), a cross-sectional study of a representative sample of the Spanish population (9–75 years old; n = 2009) carried out in 2013, was used.\n Food and beverage records were obtained by a three-day dietary record by using a tablet device.\n The median total sugar intake was 71.5 g/day (17% Total Energy, TE), the intrinsic sugar intake was 38.3 g/day (9.6% TE), and the free sugar was 28.8 g/day (7.3% TE).\n Total sugar intake (free and intrinsic) was higher in men than in women for all age groups, although in terms of the contribution to total energy intake, the opposite was observed.\n Differences were observed for free sugar consumption dependent on age and marked differences (up to two-fold) were observed when considering the percent TE, which was much higher in children and adolescents.\n For the intrinsic sugar, however, a higher contribution to TE was observed in the elderly.\n The major sources of intrinsic sugars were fruits (31.8%), milks (19.6%), juices and nectars (11.1%), vegetables (9.89%), yogurt and fermented milk (7.18%), low-alcohol-content beverages (4,94%), bread (2.91%), and sugar soft drinks (2.24%), greater than 90% from diet contribution.\n As for free sugars, sources were sugar soft drinks (25.5%), sugar (17.8%), bakery and pastry items (15.2%), chocolates (11.4%), yogurt and fermented milk (6.44%), other dairy products (5.99%), jams (3.58%), juices and nectars (2.91%), and breakfast cereals and cereal bars (2.78%), summing up to 90% of the contribution.\n The present study demonstrates that only a moderate percentage of the Spanish population adhered to the present recommendations for total sugar intake, and urgent efforts are needed to improve diet quality in the youngest populations.\n","id":"PMC5372938","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emma","surname":"Ruiz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paula","surname":"Rodriguez","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Teresa","surname":"Valero","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"José

Sweeteners in the Packaged Food Supply—An Assessment across 4 Countries","abstract":"Increased interest among consumers in the reduction of dietary sugar intake has led to the wider availability of food products containing non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS).\n However, the extent to which NNS are currently being used by manufacturers to sweeten processed food and beverage products, and how NNS may be displacing added sugars as a sweetener is unknown.\n The current study utilized branded food composition databases from Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and the US to determine the percentage of processed food and beverage products for which there are nutrition data containing NNS and to compare total sugar density (g per 100 mL for beverages and g per 100 g for foods) between products with and without NNS.\n Ordinary least squares regression at the country-product level was performed to examine associations between presence of NNS and total sugar.\n Across all countries, 5% of products contained at least one NNS, with the highest prevalence among beverages (22%).\n Mexico had the highest percentage of products with NNS (11%), as compared to the United States (US) (4%), New Zealand (1%), and Australia (&lt;1%).\n The presence of NNS was associated with lower mean total sugar density among beverages (range across countries: 7.5 to 8.7 g per 100 mL) and among foods (23.2 to 25.5 g per 100 g).\n Products with both added sugar ingredients and NNS had a lower overall mean total sugar density when compared to products containing only added sugar ingredients.\n Due to paucity of data on sales and market shares across these countries, our results do not reflect the extent to which consumers purchase NNS containing products.\n Continued monitoring of NNS in the food supply, extension of work from these data, and inclusion of market shares of products will be important as more countries introduce policies to reduce sugar.\n","id":"PMC5852833","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Elizabeth K.","surname":"Dunford","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lindsey

Low- and No-Calorie Sweeteners: Safety, Nutritional Aspects and Benefits in Food and Beverages","abstract":"International scientific experts in food, nutrition, dietetics, endocrinology, physical activity, paediatrics, nursing, toxicology and public health met in Lisbon on 2–4 July 2017 to develop a Consensus on the use of low- and no-calorie sweeteners (LNCS) as substitutes for sugars and other caloric sweeteners.\n LNCS are food additives that are broadly used as sugar substitutes to sweeten foods and beverages with the addition of fewer or no calories.\n They are also used in medicines, health-care products, such as toothpaste, and food supplements.\n The goal of this Consensus was to provide a useful, evidence-based, point of reference to assist in efforts to reduce free sugars consumption in line with current international public health recommendations.\n Participating experts in the Lisbon Consensus analysed and evaluated the evidence in relation to the role of LNCS in food safety, their regulation and the nutritional and dietary aspects of their use in foods and beverages.\n The conclusions of this Consensus were: (1) LNCS are some of the most extensively evaluated dietary constituents, and their safety has been reviewed and confirmed by regulatory bodies globally including the World Health Organisation, the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Food Safety Authority; (2) Consumer education, which is based on the most robust scientific evidence and regulatory processes, on the use of products containing LNCS should be strengthened in a comprehensive and objective way; (3) The use of LNCS in weight reduction programmes that involve replacing caloric sweeteners with LNCS in the context of structured diet plans may favour sustainable weight reduction.\n Furthermore, their use in diabetes management programmes may contribute to a better glycaemic control in patients, albeit with modest results.\n LNCS also provide dental health benefits when used in place of free sugars; (4) It is proposed that foods and beverages with LNCS could be included in dietary guidelines as alternative options to products sweetened with free sugars; (5) Continued education of health professionals is required, since they are a key source of information on issues related to food and health for both the general population and patients.\n With this in mind, the publication of position statements and consensus documents in the academic literature are extremely desirable.\n","id":"PMC6073242","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lluis","surname":"Serra-Majem","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"António","surname":"Raposo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"António","surname":"Raposo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Javier","surname":"Aranceta-Bartrina","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Javier","surname":"Aranceta-Bartrina","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gregorio","surname":"Varela-Moreiras","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Caomhan","surname":"Logue","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hugo","surname":"Laviada","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susana","surname":"Socolovsky","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carmen","surname":"Pérez-Rodrigo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jorge

total water intake (TWI) are scarce.\n There is a clear need for a national study that quantifies water and beverage intakes and explores associations between the types of beverages and energy intakes.\n Methods: The Anthropometry, Intake and Energy Balance Study ANIBES is a national survey of diet and nutrition conducted among a representative sample of 2285 healthy participants aged 9–75 years in Spain.\n Food and beverage intakes were assessed in a food diary over three days.\n Day and time of beverage consumption were also recorded.\n Results: On average, TWI was 1.7 L (SE 21.2) for men and 1.6 L (SE 18.9) for women.\n More than 75% of participants had inadequate TWI, according to European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommendations.\n Mean total energy intake (EI) was 1810 kcal/day (SE 11.1), of which 12% was provided by beverages.\n Water was the most consumed beverage, followed by milk.\n The contribution of alcoholic drinks to the EI was near 3%.\n For caloric soft drinks, a relatively low contribution to the EI was obtained, only 2%.\n Of eight different types of beverages, the variety score was positively correlated with TWI (r = 0.39) and EI (r = 0.23), suggesting that beverage variety is an indicator of higher consumption of food and drinks.\n Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that well-conducted surveys such as the ANIBES study have the potential to yield rich contextual value data that can emphasize the need to undertake appropriate health and nutrition policies to increase the total water intake at the population level promoting a healthy Mediterranean hydration

2015. Together, 52.6% of all analyzed products contained free sugar, which accounted for an average of 57.5% of the total sugar content.\n Food categories with the highest median free sugar content were: honey and syrups (78.0 g/100 g), jellies (62.9 g/100 g), chocolate and sweets (44.6 g/100 g), jam and spreads (35.9 g/100 g), and cereal bars (23.8 g/100 g).\n Using year-round sales data provided by the retailers, the data showed that chocolate, sweets, and soft drinks alone accounted for more than 50% of all free sugar sold on the Slovenian market.\n The results of this study can be used to prepare more targeted interventions and efficient dietary recommendations.\n","id":"PMC5852727","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nina","surname":"Zupani?","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Krista","surname":"Miklavec","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Krista","surname":"Miklavec","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anita","surname":"Kušar","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Anita","surname":"Kušar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Katja","surname":"Žmitek","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Katja","surname":"Žmitek","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nataša","surname":"Fidler Mis","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nataša","surname":"Fidler Mis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Igor","surname":"Pravst","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Igor","surname":"Pravst","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601426","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Selection of methodology to assess food intake","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3148/73.3.2012.e253","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Dietary assessment and self-monitoring: With nutrition applications for mobile devices","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.1093/humupd/dmp050","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Maternal metabolism and obesity: Modifiable determinants of pregnancy outcome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1515/jpm-2018-0431","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Maternal abdominal subcutaneous fat thickness as a simple predictor for gestational diabetes mellitus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJM199801153380302","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prepregnancy weight and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1155/2017/6073167","date":"2017-03-20","title":"Do miRNAs Play a Role in Fetal Growth Restriction?

increasing evidences on the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in a variety of pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia and FGR.\n More than 1880 miRNAs have been reported in humans and most of them are expressed in placenta.\n In this paper, we aimed to review the current evidence about the topic.\n According to retrieved data, controversial results about placental expression of miRNAs could be due (at least in part) to the different experimental methods used by different groups.\n Despite the fact that several authors have demonstrated a relatively easy and feasible detection of some miRNAs in maternal whole peripheral blood, costs of these tests should be reduced in order to increase cohorts and have stronger evidence.\n In this regard, we take the opportunity to solicit future studies on large cohort and adequate statistical power, in order to identify a panel of biomarkers on maternal peripheral blood for early diagnosis of

hypoxia and growth restriction.\n We sought to investigate the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in regulating vasomotor tone in the fetoplacental vasculature.\n H2S is produced endogenously by catalytic activity of cystathionine ?-synthase and cystathionine ?-lyase (CSE).\n Immunohistochemical analysis localized CSE to smooth muscle cells encircling arteries in stem villi.\n Immunoreactivity was reduced in placentas from pregnancies with severe early-onset growth-restriction and preeclampsia displaying abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveforms compared with preeclamptic placentas with normal waveforms and controls.\n These findings were confirmed at the protein and mRNA levels.\n MicroRNA-21, which negatively regulates CSE expression, was increased in placentas with abnormal Doppler waveforms.\n Exposure of villus explants to hypoxia-reoxygenation significantly reduced CSE protein and mRNA and increased microRNA-21 expression.\n No changes were observed in cystathionine ?-synthase expression, immunolocalized principally to the trophoblast, in pathologic placentas or in vitro.\n Finally, perfusion of normal placentas with an H2S donor, after preconstriction with a thromboxane mimetic, resulted in dose-dependent vasorelaxation.\n Glibenclamide and NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester partially blocked the effect, indicating that H2S acts through ATP-sensitive K+ channels and nitric oxide synthesis.\n These results demonstrate that H2S is a powerful vasodilator of the placental vasculature and that expression of CSE is reduced in placentas associated with increased vascular

in patients with established preeclampsia (n = 63), fetal growth restriction (n = 27), and gestational hypertension (n = 23).\n We examined the correlation between plasmatic concentrations and

quantification approaches, increased extracellular C19MC microRNA levels (miR-516-5p, P = 0.037, P = 0.009; miR-517?, P = 0.033, P = 0.043; miR-520a?, P = 0.001, P = 0.009; miR-525, P = 0.026, P =

that low birth weight (LBW) offspring, from UPI-induced IUGR pregnancies, would display a visceral adipose lipogenic molecular signature involving altered gene expression, phosphorylation status of proteins of the lipid synthesis pathway and microRNA (miR) expression profile, occurring in association with increased visceral adiposity.\n Normal birth weight (NBW) and LBW (obtained by uterine artery ablation) male guinea pig pups were fed a control diet from weaning to 145 days and sacrificed.\n Despite being lighter at birth, LBW pups displayed body weights similar to NBW offspring at 145 days.\n At this age, which represents young adulthood, the relative weights of LBW epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) and lipid content were increased; which was consistent with adipocyte hypertrophy in the LBW offspring.\n Additionally, the mRNA expression of lipid synthesis-related genes including acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), diglyceride acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 1 (PPAR?1), was increased in LBW EWAT.\n Further, LBW EWAT displayed decreased phospho-ACC (Ser79) and phospho-PPAR? (Ser273) proteins.\n Moreover, the mRNA expression of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), both involved in promoting adipose lipid storage, was increased in LBW EWAT.\n Finally, miR-24 and miR-103-2, miRs related to adipocyte development, were both increased in LBW EWAT.\n These findings indicate that, following an adverse in utero environment, lipid synthesis-related genes and miR expression, along with phosphorylation status of key regulators of lipid synthesis, appear to be chronically altered and occur in association with increased visceral adiposity in young adult IUGR male offspring.\n","id":"PMC4057084","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ousseynou","surname":"Sarr","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jennifer A.","surname":"Thompson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ting-Yim","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Timothy R.

for Fetal Hypoxia In-Utero","abstract":"Stillbirth affects 1 in 200 pregnancies and commonly arises due to a lack of oxygen supply to the fetus.\n Current tests to detect fetal hypoxia in-utero lack the sensitivity to identify many babies at risk.\n Emerging evidence suggests that microRNAs derived from the placenta circulate in the maternal blood during pregnancy and may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for pregnancy complications.\n In this study, we examined the expression of miRs known to be regulated by hypoxia in two clinical settings of significant fetal hypoxia: 1) labour and 2) fetal growth restriction.\n Six miRs (miR 210, miR 21, miR 424, miR 199a, miR 20b, and miR 373) were differentially expressed in pregnancies complicated by fetal hypoxia.\n In healthy term pregnancies there was a 4.2 fold increase in miR 210 (p&lt;0.01), 2.7 fold increase in miR 424 (p&lt;0.05), 2.6 fold increase in miR 199a (p&lt;0.01) and 2.3 fold increase in miR 20b (p&lt;0.05) from prior to labour to delivery of the fetus.\n Furthermore, the combined expression of miR 21 and miR 20b correlated with the degree of fetal hypoxia at birth determined by umbilical cord lactate delivery (r?=?0.79, p?=?0.03).\n In pregnancies complicated by severe preterm fetal growth restriction there was upregulation of the hypoxia-regulated miRs compared to gestation-matched controls: 3.6 fold in miR 210 (p&lt;0.01), 3.6 fold in miR 424 (p&lt;0.05), 5.9 fold in miR 21 (p&lt;0.01), 3.8 fold in miR 199a (p&lt;0.01) and 3.7 fold in miR 20b (p&lt;0.01).\n Interestingly, the expression of miR 373 in gestation matched controls was very low, but was very highly expressed in FGR (p&lt;0.0001).\n Furthermore, the expression increased in keeping with the degree of in-utero hypoxia estimated by fetal Doppler velocimetry.\n We conclude quantifying hypoxia-regulated miRs in the maternal blood may identify pregnancies at risk of fetal hypoxia, enabling early intervention to improve perinatal outcomes.\n","id":"PMC3839903","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Clare L.","surname":"Whitehead","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wan

place in fatty acid, amino acid and nucleic acid metabolic pathways.\n The deficiency of vitamin B12 is clinically manifested in the blood and nervous system where the cobalamin plays a key role in cell replication and in fatty acid metabolism.\n Hypovitaminosis arises from inadequate absorption, from genetic defects that alter transport through the body, or from inadequate intake as a result of diet.\n With the growing adoption of vegetarian eating styles in Western countries, there is growing focus on whether diets that exclude animal foods are adequate.\n Since food availability in these countries is not a problem, and therefore plant foods are sufficiently adequate, the most delicate issue remains the contribution of cobalamin, which is poorly represented in plants.\n In this review, we will discuss the status of vitamin B12 among vegetarians, the diagnostic markers for the detection of cobalamin deficiency and appropriate sources for sufficient intake, through the description of

calcium-phosphorus homeostasis but recently a lot of in vitro and in vivo studies recognized several “noncalcemic” effects of vitamin D metabolites.\n Accumulating evidence suggests that the metabolic pathways of this vitamin may play a key role in the developing of gynaecological/obstetric diseases.\n VDR-mediated signalling pathways and vitamin D levels seem to (deeply) affect the risk of several gynaecological diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and ovarian and even breast cancer.\n On the other hand, since also the maternal-fetal unit is under the influence of vitamin D, a breakdown in its homeostasis may underlie infertility, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).\n According to our literature review, the relationship between vitamin D and gynaecological/obstetric diseases must be replicated in future studies which could clarify the molecular machineries behind their development.\n We suggest that further investigation should take into account the different serum levels of this vitamin, the several actions which arise from the binding between it and its receptor (taking into account its possible polymorphism), and finally the interplay between vitamin D metabolism and other hormonal and metabolic

development.\n Their identification in specific physiological processes, like angiogenesis, a key pathway in placental vascular development in pregnancy, suggests an important role of miRNAs that regulate angiogenesis (angiomiRs).\n Many complications of pregnancy have in common placental vascular alterations, involving an imbalance in the angiogenesis process in the development of conditions such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and gestational diabetes, complications with the highest rates of morbimortality in pregnancy.\n Many studies have identified angiomiRs with differential expression profiles in each of these diseases; however, this evidence requires further studies focused on evaluating their potential as biomarkers of risk for the angiomiRs detected, to establish correlations between placental tissue and serum/plasma expression profiles.\n Therefore, the objective of this review is to highlight the best angiomiRs detected in placental tissue and serum/plasma in each of these three pathologies to show the current data available for potential biomarkers and to propose future research strategies on this

psychomotor stimulant drug: the moderating effect of “food-addiction”","abstract":"There is mounting evidence that many highly processed foods have addictive properties, and that some cases of compulsive overeating resemble an addiction disorder.\n While support for the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) as a valid diagnostic tool has been impressive and continues to increase, to date, no research has examined the food-addiction construct in response to an actual food stimulus, and in relation to direct measures of appetite and food consumption.\n As part of a larger community-based study of overeating in healthy adults who were predominately overweight and obese (aged 25–50 years), 136 participants completed the YFAS, of whom 23 met the diagnostic criteria for food-addiction.\n They took part in a 2-day, double-blind, cross-over, single-dose drug challenge using a psychomotor stimulant (methylphenidate) and placebo.\n Participants were first assessed on ratings of appetite and food cravings after holding and tasting their favorite snack food, after which they were able to eat all or part of the snack, as they wished.\n Three separate repeated-measures analysis-of-variance procedures were carried out, each with two between-subjects factors (Diagnosis: food-addiction vs.\n non-food addiction) and (Sex: male vs.\n female) and 1 within-subjects factor (Days: drug vs.\n placebo).\n As anticipated, for all three dependent variables, there was a significant main effect for Days with a response decrease from placebo to the drug condition.\n With respect to food cravings and appetite ratings, results indicated that the food addiction group had significantly higher scores on both variables.\n For food consumption, there was a significant Days × Diagnosis interaction whereby the food-addiction group showed no food-intake suppression across days compared to the non-food-addiction group who demonstrated a significant decrease in snack-food consumption with methylphenidate.\n The finding that the food-addiction group was resistant to the food-intake suppression typically induced by a dopamine agonist supports evidence of dopamine signaling-strength differences in individuals with compulsive overeating compared to those without this disorder.\n This represents the first demonstration that individuals defined by their food-addiction status have a unique pattern of food-intake following a pharmacologic challenge with such agents.\n","id":"PMC4021123","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Caroline","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert

trait (FCQ-T; 39 items) and state (FCQ-S; 15 items) version.\n Scores on the FCQ-T have been found to be positively associated with eating pathology, body mass index (BMI), low dieting success and increases in state food craving during cognitive tasks involving appealing food stimuli.\n The current studies evaluated reliability and validity of a reduced version of the FCQ-T consisting of 15 items only (FCQ-T-r).\n Study 1 was a questionnaire study conducted online among students (N = 323).\n In study 2, female students (N = 70) performed a working memory task involving food and neutral pictures.\n Study 1 indicated a one-factorial structure and high internal consistency (? = 0.94) of the FCQ-T-r.\n Scores of the FCQ-T-r were positively correlated with BMI and negatively correlated with dieting success.\n In study 2, participants reported higher state food craving after the task compared to before.\n This increase was positively correlated with the FCQ-T-r.\n Hours since the last meal positively predicted food craving before the task when controlling for FCQ-T-r scores and the interaction of both variables.\n Contrarily, FCQ-T-r scores positively predicted food craving after the task when controlling for food deprivation and the interaction term.\n Thus, trait food craving was specifically associated with state food craving triggered by palatable food-cues, but not with state food craving related to plain hunger.\n Results indicate high reliability of the FCQ-T-r.\n Replicating studies that used the long version, small-to-medium correlations with BMI and dieting success could be found.\n Finally, scores on the FCQ-T-r predicted cue-elicited food craving, providing further support of its validity.\n The FCQ-T-r constitutes a succinct, valid and reliable

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died

to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nWhen an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered.\n\n Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities.\n\n The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities.\n At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down.\n It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities.\n Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma.\n The severity of this epidemic and its long-lasting repercussions

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire.\n\n Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access.\n\n\nIn addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6).\n\n The total Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n The perceived dangerous Pollutant

predictors of psychological problems among methadone maintenance treatment patients in difference types of settings in Vietnam","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Methadone, a long-acting opioid agonist maintenance treatment (MMT) is used to treat opioid addiction by preventing opioid withdrawal and reducing cravings.\n\n However, it is important to note that mental conditions may persist, or even remain undetected while methadone maintenance treatment is ongoing.\n\n This study aimed to examine the level of psychological problems among MMT patients at public and private health facilities and identify associated factors.\n\n\nMethod\nid='Par2'>From January to September 2018, a cross-sectional study was performed in Nam Dinh province, one of the largest epicenters providing HIV/AIDS surveillance and treatment services in the North of Vietnam.\n\n 395 male respondents currently receiving MMT agreed to participate in a face-to-face interview.\n\n Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were used to assess psychological problems among patients.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The percentage of patients suffering from mild to extremely severe anxiety was the highest among psychological problems (18%).\n\n 2.8% of participants had mild depressive symptoms and the percentage of those having mild or moderate stress was approximately 4%.\n\n In addition, the longer treatment duration, the lower mental health scores regarding three types of psychological problems.\n\n Respondents who received MMT services in public health facilities were more likely to have a higher score of all psychological problems.\n\n Participants who lived with partners or spouse, having higher monthly family income had a lower likelihood of having severe depression and stress

patients receiving treatment in public health facilities might have higher rate of psychological problems, including depression, anxiety, and stress than that of those in the private health facility.\n\n These results highlight the necessity of taking psychological counseling adequately for MMT patients and psychological assessment should be prioritized in the early stage of treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6751619","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tuan Anh","surname":"Le","email":"lat@nihe.org.vn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mai

Participants were recruited by an online recruitment post and snowball sampling techniques.\n\n Participants were required to complete an online survey which was composed of demographics questionnaire, physical symptom checklist, perceived dangerous Pollutant Standard Index (PSI) value and views on the N-95 mask and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R).\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 participants returned the completed study questionnaire.\n\n The respondents reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (S.\n\nD.\n\n = 2.6).\n\n The five most common physical symptoms include mouth or throat discomfort (68.8%), nose discomfort (64.1%), eye discomfort (60.7%), headache (50.3%) and breathing difficulty (40.3%).\n\n The total IES-R score was 18.47 (S.\n\nD.\n\n = 11.69) which indicated that the study population experienced mild psychological stress but not to the extent of acute stress reaction syndrome.\n\n The perceived dangerous PSI level and number of physical symptoms were significantly associated with the mean intrusion score, mean hyper-arousal score, total mean IES-R score and total IES-R score (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that a haze crisis is associated with acute physical symptoms and mild psychological stress.\n\n The number of physical symptoms and the perceived dangerous PSI values are important factors associated with psychological stress.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3995317","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Roger C","surname":"Ho","email":"hocmroger@yahoo.com.sg","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Melvyn W","surname":"Zhang","email":"melvynzhangweibin@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S","surname":"Ho","email":"cyrushosh@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fang","surname":"Pan","email":"pan_fang2003@hotmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanxia","surname":"Lu","email":"yanxialu@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vijay K","surname":"Sharma","email":"vijay_kumar_sharma@nuhs.edu.sg","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.032","date":"2020-03-29","title":"The emotional impact of COVID-19: From medical staff to common people","abstract":"","id":"PMC7138159","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Montemurro","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1017/dmp.2015.38","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Is there a case for quarantine?

associated with adverse perinatal outcomes and high risk for chronic disease both for the mother and for the child.\n\n Physical exercise is feasible for diabetic pregnant women and contributes to better glycemic control and to a decrease in adverse perinatal outcomes.\n\n However, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the effects of aquatic physical exercise on GDM control and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.\n\n\nMethods/Design\nAn RCT will be conducted at Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof Fernando Figueira (IMIP), Brazil.\n\n A total of 72 pregnant women will be studied; 36 gestational diabetics will undergo an aquatic physical exercise program in a thermal pool, 3 times per week over 2 months.\n\n The primary endpoint will be glucose level control and use of insulin; secondary endpoints will be the following maternal and fetal outcomes: weight gain during pregnancy, blood pressure, pre-eclampsia diagnosis, intrauterus growth restriction, preterm birth, Cesarean section, macrosomia and maternal or neonatal intensive care admission.\n\n Endpoints between intervention and control group will analyzed by t test for unpaired data and ?2 test, and the level of significance will set at &lt;0.05.\nDiscussion\nThe physical proprieties of water make aquatic exercises ideal for pregnant women.\n\n An aquatic physical exercise program developed for GDM women will be trialed in a thermal pool and under the supervision of physiotherapist to ensure compliance.\n\n It is expected that this study will provide evidence as to the effect of aquatic physical

outcomes in women with diabetes","abstract":"Pregnancy affects both the maternal and fetal metabolism and even in nondiabetic women exerts a diabetogenic effect.\n Among pregnant women, 2 to 17.8% develop gestational diabetes.\n Pregnancy can also occur in women with preexisting diabetes, that can predispose the fetus to many alterations in organogenesis, growth restriction and the mother to some diabetes-related complications like retinopathy and nephropathy or accelerate the course of these complications if they are already present.\n Women with gestational diabetes generally start their treatment with diet and lifestyle modification; when these changes fail in keeping an optimal glycemic control, then insulin therapy must be considered.\n Women with type 2 diabetes in use of oral hypoglycemic agents are advised to change to insulin therapy.\n Those with preexisting type 1 diabetes must start an intensive glycemic control, preferably before conception.\n All these procedures are performed aiming to keep glycemic levels normal or near-normal as possible to avoid the occurrence of adverse perinatal outcomes to the mother and to the fetus.\n The aim of this review is to reinforce the need to improve the knowledge on reproductive health of women with diabetes during gestation and to understand what are the reasons for them failing to attend for prepregnancy care programs, and to understand the underlying mechanisms of adverse fetal and maternal outcomes, which in turn may lead to strategies for its prevention.\n","id":"PMC3514247","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carlos

Studies assessing the relationship between physical activity and subsequent development of GDM were included.\n\n Characteristics including study design, country, GDM diagnostic criteria, ascertainment of physical activity, timing of exposure (prepregnancy or early pregnancy), adjusted relative risks, CIs, and statistical methods were extracted independently by two reviewers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur search identified seven prepregnancy and five early pregnancy studies, including five prospective cohorts, two retrospective case-control studies, and two cross-sectional study designs.\n\n Prepregnancy physical activity was assessed in 34,929 total participants, which included 2,813 cases of GDM, giving a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.45 (95% CI 0.28–0.75) when the highest versus lowest categories were compared.\n\n Exercise in early pregnancy was assessed in 4,401 total participants, which included 361 cases of GDM, and was also significantly protective (0.76 [95% CI 0.70–0.83]).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigher levels of physical activity before pregnancy or in early pregnancy are associated with a significantly lower risk of developing

and obese pregnant women","abstract":"Background\nWhilst there has been increasing research interest in interventions which promote physical activity during pregnancy few studies have yielded detailed insights into the views and experiences of overweight and obese pregnant women themselves.\n\n The qualitative study described in this paper aimed to: (i) explore the views and experiences of overweight and obese pregnant women; and (ii) inform interventions which could promote the adoption of physical activity during pregnancy.\n\n\nMethods\nThe study was framed by a combined Subtle Realism and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) approach.\n\n This enabled us to examine the hypothetical pathway between beliefs and physical activity intentions within the context of day to day life.\n\n The study sample for the qualitative study was chosen by stratified, purposive sampling from a previous study of physical activity measurements in pregnancy.\n\n Research participants for the current study were recruited on the basis of Body Mass Index (BMI) at booking and parity.\n\n Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 14 overweight and obese pregnant women.\n\n Data analysis was undertaken using a Framework Approach and was informed by TPB.\n\n\nResults\nHealthy eating was often viewed as being of greater importance for the health of mother and baby than participation in physical activity.\n\n A commonly cited motivator for maintaining physical activity during pregnancy is an aid to reducing pregnancy-related weight gain.\n\n However, participants often described how they would wait until the postnatal period to try and lose weight.\n\n A wide range of barriers to physical activity during pregnancy were highlighted including both internal (physical and psychological) and external (work, family, time and environmental).\n\n The study participants also lacked access to consistent information, advice and support on the benefits of physical activity during pregnancy.\n\n\nConclusions\nInterventions to encourage recommended levels of physical activity in pregnancy should be accompanied by accessible and consistent information about the positive effects for mother and baby.\n\n More research is required to examine how to overcome barriers to physical activity and to understand which interventions could be most effective for overweight/obese pregnant women.\n\n Midwives should be encouraged to do more to promote activity in pregnancy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2879230","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zoe","surname":"Weir","email":"mcdowellzoe@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Judith","surname":"Bush","email":"judith.bush@ncl.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephen

A qualitative study","abstract":"Background\nNational guidelines recommend that healthy pregnant women take 30 minutes or more of moderate exercise a day.\n\n Most women reduce the level of physical activity during pregnancy but only a few studies of women's experiences of physical activity during pregnancy exist.\n\n The aim of the present study was to elucidate experiences and views of leisure time physical activity during pregnancy in nulliparous women who were physically active prior to their pregnancy.\n\n\nMethods\nA qualitative study was conducted by means of personal interviews.\n\n Nineteen women, all with a moderate pre-pregnancy level of physical activity but with different levels of physical activity during pregnancy, participated in the study.\n\n Content analysis was applied.\n\n\nResults\nIn the analyses of experiences and views of physical activities during pregnancy, four categories and nine sub-categories were developed: Physical activity as a lifestyle (Habit and Desire to continue), Body awareness (Pregnancy-related discomfort, Having a complicated pregnancy and A growing body), Carefulness (Feelings of worry and Balancing worry and sense of security) and Sense of benefit (Feelings of happiness and Physical well-being).\n\n\nConclusion\nAs other studies have also shown, women find that the discomfort and complications associated with pregnancy, the growing body, and a sense of insecurity with physical activity are barriers to maintaining former levels of physical activity.\n\n This study adds a new perspective by describing women's perceptions of these barriers and of overcoming them - thus, when pregnant, the majority of the women do not cease to be physically active but continue to be so.\n\n Barriers are overcome by applying one's own experience, looking to role models, mirroring the activities of other pregnant women and following the advice of experts (midwives/physiotherapists).\n\n Women then continue to be physically active during pregnancy, most often to a lesser extent or in alternative activities, and derive considerable enjoyment and physical well-being from this.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2913936","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hanne

the GT3X, it would be of tremendous value to know if these accelerometers give similar information about intensities of PA.\n\n Knowing if output is similar would have implications for cross-examination of studies.\n\n The purpose of the study was to assess the validity of the GT1M and the GT3X Actigraph accelerometers for the assessment of physical activity against oxygen consumption in laboratory conditions.\n\n\nMethods\nForty-two college-aged participants aged 18-25 years wore the GT1M and the GT3X on their right hip during treadmill exercise at three different speeds, slow walking 4.8 km.\n\nh-1, fast walking 6.4 km.\n\nh-1, and running 9.7 km.\n\nh-1).\n\n Oxygen consumption was measured minute-by minute using a metabolic system.\n\n Bland-Altman plots were used to assess agreement between activity counts from the GT3X and GT1M, and correlations were assessed the ability of the accelerometers to assess physical activity.\n\n\nResults\nBias for 4.8 km.\n\nh-1 was 2814.4 cpm (limits 1211.3 to 4417.4), for 6.4 km.\n\nh-1 was 3713.6 cpm (limits 1573.2 to 5854.0), and for 9.7 km.\n\nh-1 was?3811.2 cpm (limits 842.1 to 6780.3).\n\n Correlations between counts per minute for the GT1M and the GT3X were significantly correlated with VO2 (r?=?0.881, p?&lt;?0.001; r?=?0.810, p?&lt;?0.001 respectively).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe present study showed that both the GT1M and the GT3X accurately measure physical activity when compared to oxygen

of anxiety and depressive symptoms among obese pregnant and postpartum women: an intervention study","abstract":"Background\nAlthough studies have shown an association between anxiety and depression and obesity, psychological health among obese women during and after pregnancy has not been carefully studied.\n\n The aim of this study was to investigate psychological well-being using symptoms of depression and/or anxiety among obese pregnant women attending a weight gain restriction program and to then compare this group with a control group receiving traditional antenatal care.\n\n\nMethods\n151 obese pregnant women in an intervention group and 188 obese pregnant women in a control group answered the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).\n\n Group differences between the two groups were estimated by using the ?2 - test on categorical variables.\n\n The Student's t-test on continuous, normally distributed variables measuring changes in mean score on BAI and EPDS over time was used.\n\n To make a more comprehensive assessment of group differences, between as well as within the two groups, logistic regressions were performed with the BAI and EPDS as dependent variables, measured at gestational weeks 15 and 35 and 11 weeks postnatal.\n\n The grouping variable has been adjusted for socio-demographic variables and complications.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of symptoms of anxiety during pregnancy varied between 24% and 25% in the intervention group and 22% and 23% in the control group.\n\n The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety postnatally was 9% in the intervention group and 11% in the control group.\n\n Five percent of the women in the intervention group and 4% of the women in the control group showed symptoms of anxiety during the course of pregnancy and at the postpartum assessment.\n\n The prevalence of symptoms of depression during pregnancy varied between 19% and 22% in the intervention group but was constant at 18% in the control group.\n\n Postnatal prevalence was 11% in both groups.\n\n Six percent of the women in the intervention group and 4% in the control group showed symptoms of depression during the course of pregnancy and at the postpartum assessment.\n\n We found no differences between the two groups as concerns demographic characteristics, weight gain in kg, or the distribution of scores on anxiety and depressive symptoms nor did we find differences in the fluctuation of anxiety and depressive symptoms over time between the women in the intervention group and in the control group.\n\n\nConclusion\nObese pregnant women attending an intervention program seem to have the same risk of experiencing anxiety and/or depressive symptoms as do obese pregnant and postnatal women in general.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3016389","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ing-Marie","surname":"Claesson","email":"Ing-Marie.Claesson@liu.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ann","surname":"Josefsson","email":"Ann.Josefsson@lio.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gunilla","surname":"Sydsjö","email":"Gunilla.Sydsjo@lio.se","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1192/bjp.150.6.782","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection

increasing urgency for clear, common and accepted terminology and definitions.\n\n Such standardization is difficult to achieve, especially across multi-disciplinary researchers, practitioners, and industries.\n\n The Sedentary Behavior Research Network (SBRN) undertook a Terminology Consensus Project to address this need.\n\n\nMethod\nFirst, a literature review was completed to identify key terms in sedentary behavior research.\n\n These key terms were then reviewed and modified by a Steering Committee formed by SBRN.\n\n Next, SBRN members were invited to contribute to this project and interested participants reviewed and provided feedback on the proposed list of terms and draft definitions through an online survey.\n\n Finally, a conceptual model and consensus definitions (including caveats and examples for all age groups and functional abilities) were finalized based on the feedback received from the 87 SBRN member participants who responded to the original invitation and survey.\n\n\nResults\nConsensus definitions for the terms physical inactivity, stationary behavior, sedentary behavior, standing, screen time, non-screen-based sedentary time, sitting, reclining, lying, sedentary behavior pattern, as well as how the terms bouts, breaks, and interruptions should be used in this context are provided.\n\n\nConclusion\nIt is hoped that the definitions resulting from this comprehensive, transparent, and broad-based participatory process will result in standardized terminology that is widely supported and adopted, thereby advancing future research, interventions, policies, and practices related to sedentary behaviors.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12966-017-0525-8) contains supplementary

physical activity guidelines in mid-pregnancy does not reduce sedentary time: an observational study","abstract":"Background\nPhysical activity (PA) interventions designed to prevent prenatal complications have focused on increasing moderate PA yielding conflicting results.\n\n Minimal attention has focused on the evaluation of sleep, sedentary behavior (SB), light activity or total daily PA during pregnancy.\n\n The purpose of this prospective, longitudinal study was to 1) objectively quantify and compare habitual PA and SB during the 2nd and 3rd trimester; and 2) evaluate differences in activity patterns for women meeting prenatal PA guidelines versus those that did not.\n\n\nMethods\nForty-six participants wore 2 PA monitors (SenseWear® Mini and activPAL™) during week 18 and week 35 of pregnancy.\n\n We compared differences in sleep duration, postural allocation, daily steps, and PA between the 2nd and 3rd trimester and for women who met and did not meet PA guidelines.\n\n\nResults\nDuring the 2nd trimester, 30% of the women’s day (24-hours) was total sleep; 52% SB; 13% light; 3% moderate; and 0% vigorous PA.\n\n Light (P?=?0.05), vigorous (P?=?0.02), and moderate-vigorous PA (MET-minutes; P?=?0.02), decreased with a trend in increased SB (P?=?0.07).\n\n Activity of other intensities and sleep duration did not significantly change.\n\n Only 39% and 37% of participants slept between 7–9 hours/night at week 18 and 35, respectively.\n\n Forty-six percent (n?=?21) and 28% (n?=?13) of participants met prenatal PA guidelines during the 2nd and 3rd trimester, respectively.\n\n At week 18, no differences in total sleep, SB, or light PA existed for women who met PA guidelines versus those who did not; total PA was significantly greater for women who met guidelines.\n\n At week 35, women that met PA guidelines had significantly less SB (P?&lt;?0.005) than women who did not.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates that pregnant women spend the majority of their day in SB.\n\n Significant reductions in total activity across pregnancy may be attributed, in part to shifts in light PA and increased SB.\n\n Based on the lifestyle of our sample, regardless of meeting PA guidelines in mid-pregnancy, no significant difference exists in time spent in SB, however meeting PA recommendations in late pregnancy may reduce SB.\n\n Future interventions should target reducing SB by increasing light and moderate PA beyond volitional exercise.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4345024","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Diana R","surname":"Di

important determinants of excessive fetal growth.\n\n The aim of the study was to evaluate the independent role of pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), gestational weight gain and gestational diabetes on the risk of macrosomia.\n\n\nMethods\nA prospective study collected data on mode of delivery and maternal/neonatal outcomes in eleven Hospitals in Italy.\n\n Multiple pregnancies and preterm deliveries were excluded.\n\n The sample included 14109 women with complete records.\n\n Associations between exposure variables and newborn macrosomia were analyzed using Pearson’s chi squared test.\n\n Multiple logistic regression models were built to assess the independent association between potential predictors and macrosomia.\n\n\nResults\nMaternal obesity (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-2.2), excessive gestational weight gain (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.6-2.2) and diabetes (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-3.0 for gestational; adjusted OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2-7.6 for pre-gestational) resulted to be independent predictors of macrosomia, when adjusted for other recognized risk factors.\n\n Since no significant interaction was found between pre-gestational BMI and gestational weight gain, excessive weight gain should be considered an independent risk factor for macrosomia.\n\n In the sub-group of women affected by gestational or pre-gestational diabetes, pre-gestational BMI was not significantly associated to macrosomia, while excessive pregnancy weight gain, maternal height and gestational age at delivery were significantly associated.\n\n In this sub-population, pregnancy weight gain less than recommended was not significantly associated to a reduction in macrosomia.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings indicate that maternal obesity, gestational weight gain excess and diabetes should be considered as independent risk factors for newborn macrosomia.\n\n To adequately evaluate the clinical evolution of pregnancy all three variables need to be carefully assessed and monitored.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3898774","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Salvatore","surname":"Alberico","email":"salvatore.alberico@burlo.trieste.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marcella","surname":"Montico","email":"marcella.montico@burlo.trieste.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Valentina","surname":"Barresi","email":"v.barresi.ts@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lorenzo","surname":"Monasta","email":"lorenzo.monasta@burlo.trieste.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Caterina","surname":"Businelli","email":"catebusinelli@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Valentina","surname":"Soini","email":"valentina.soini@tin.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Erenbourg","email":"annaerenbourg@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luca","surname":"Ronfani","email":"luca.ronfani@burlo.trieste.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gianpaolo","surname":"Maso","email":"gianpaolo.maso@burlo.trieste.it","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181607421","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Television

impact of increased structured physical activity on glucose control.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nPhysical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and glucose levels (continuous glucose monitoring) were measured in 10 pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (age 33.2 years, gestation 20 weeks, BMI 27.9 kg/m2, diabetes duration 16.6 years, HbA1c 6.5% [48 mmol/mol], insulin pump duration 2.4 years) during a day at home (free-living) and during a 24-h visit incorporating controlled diet and structured physical activity with light intensity activity (three 20-min self-paced walks) and moderate intensity activity (two 50-min sessions of brisk treadmill walking).\n\n PAEE was evaluated through individually calibrated combined heart rate and movement sensing.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFree-living PAEE was comparable to that under controlled study conditions (3.8 and 5.1 kcal/kg/day, P = 0.241), with women achieving near to the recommended 30 min of moderate physical activity (median 27 min [interquartile range 14–68]).\n\n During the free-living period, more time was spent in light activity (10.3 vs.\n\n 7.2 h, P = 0.005), with less sedentary time (13.0 vs.\n\n 14.9 h, P = 0.047) and less moderate activity (27 vs.\n\n 121 min, P = 0.022).\n\n The free-living 24-h mean glucose levels by continuous glucose monitoring were significantly higher (7.7 vs.\n\n 6.0 mmol/L, P = 0.028).\n\n The effect of controlled diet and exercise persisted overnight, with significantly less time spent hyperglycemic (19 vs.\n\n 0%, P = 0.028) and less glucose variability (glucose SD 1.3 vs.\n\n 0.7

aims: To prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID19) total lockdown is in place in India from March 24, 2020 for 21 days.\n\n In this study, we aim to assess the impact of the duration of the lockdown on glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nA systematic search was conducted using Cochrane library.\n\n A simulation model was created using glycemic data from previous disasters (taken as similar in impact to current lockdown) taking baseline HBA1c and diabetes-related complications data from India-specific database.\n\n A multivariate regression analysis was conducted to analyse the relationship between the duration of lockdown and glycaemic targets &amp; diabetes-related complications.\n\n\nResults\nThe predictive model was extremely robust (R2 = 0.99) and predicted outcomes for period of lockdown up to 90 days.\n\n The predicted increment in HBA1c from baseline at the end of 30 days and 45 days lockdown was projected as 2.26% &amp; 3.68% respectively.\n\n Similarly, the annual predicted percentage increase in complication rates at the end of 30-day lockdown was 2.8% for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 2.9% for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.5% for retinal photocoagulation, 9.3% for microalbuminuria, 14.2% for proteinuria, 2.9% for peripheral neuropathy, 10.5% for lower extremity amputation, 0.9% for myocardial infarction, 0.5% for stroke and 0.5% for infections.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe duration of lockdown is directly proportional to the worsening of glycaemic control and diabetes-related

strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes and the health of the child.\n\n The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a behavioral intervention of diet and physical activity advice on dietary patterns in obese pregnant woman participating in the UPBEAT study, and to explore associations of dietary patterns with pregnancy outcomes.\n\n\nMethods\nIn the UPBEAT randomized controlled trial, pregnant obese women from eight UK multi-ethnic, inner-city populations were randomly assigned to receive a diet/physical activity intervention or standard antenatal care.\n\n The dietary intervention aimed to reduce glycemic load and saturated fat intake.\n\n Diet was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline (15+0-18+6 weeks’ gestation), post intervention (27+0-28+6 weeks) and in late pregnancy (34+0-36+0 weeks).\n\n Dietary patterns were characterized using factor analysis of the baseline FFQ data, and changes compared in the control and intervention arms.\n\n Patterns were related to pregnancy outcomes in the combined control/intervention cohort (n?=?1023).\n\n\nResults\nFour distinct baseline dietary patterns were defined; Fruit and vegetables, African/Caribbean, Processed, and Snacks, which were differently associated with social and demographic factors.\n\n The UPBEAT intervention significantly reduced the Processed (?0.14; 95% CI ?0.19, ?0.08, P &lt;0.0001) and Snacks (?0.24; 95% CI ?0.31, ?0.17, P &lt;0.0001) pattern scores.\n\n In the adjusted model, baseline scores for the African/Caribbean (quartile 4 compared with quartile 1:

Effects of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Gestational Diabetes: Consequences in Macrosomia and Adulthood Obesity","abstract":"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are increasingly being used to prevent cardiovascular diseases, including diabetes and obesity.\n In this paper, we report data on the observed effects of omega-3 PUFA on major metabolic disorders and immune system disruption during gestational diabetes and their consequences on macrosomia.\n While controversies still exist about omega-3 PUFA effects on antioxidant status regarding the level of omega-3 PUFA in diet supplementation, their lipid-lowering effects are unanimously recognized by researchers.\n Animal studies have shown that omega-3 PUFA contributes to the maintenance of the immune defense system by promoting the differentiation of T helper (Th) cell to a Th2 phenotype in diabetic pregnancy and by shifting the Th1/Th2 ratio from a deleterious proinflammatory Th1 phenotype to a protective anti-inflammatory Th2 phenotype in macrosomia and in adulthood obesity that results from macrosomia at birth.\n Based on the available evidence, international nutritional and food agencies recommend administration of omega-3 PUFA as triglyceride-lowering agents, for the prevention of cardiovascular disease risk and during human pregnancy and lactation.\n Furthermore, studies targeting humans are still required to explore application of the fatty acids as supplement in the management of gestational diabetes and inflammatory and immune diseases.\n","id":"PMC4415737","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Akadiri","surname":"Yessoufou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Magloire

Polyphenols, Mediterranean Diet, Prediabetes, and Type 2 Diabetes: A Narrative Review of the Evidence","abstract":"Dietary polyphenols come mainly from plant-based foods including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, coffee, tea, and nuts.\n Polyphenols may influence glycemia and type 2 diabetes (T2D) through different mechanisms, such as promoting the uptake of glucose in tissues, and therefore improving insulin sensitivity.\n This review aims to summarize the evidence from clinical trials and observational prospective studies linking dietary polyphenols to prediabetes and T2D, with a focus on polyphenol-rich foods characteristic of the Mediterranean diet.\n We aimed to describe the metabolic biomarkers related to polyphenol intake and genotype-polyphenol interactions modulating the effects on T2D.\n Intakes of polyphenols, especially flavan-3-ols, and their food sources have demonstrated beneficial effects on insulin resistance and other cardiometabolic risk factors.\n Several prospective studies have shown inverse associations between polyphenol intake and T2D.\n The Mediterranean diet and its key components, olive oil, nuts, and red wine, have been inversely associated with insulin resistance and T2D.\n To some extent, these associations may be attributed to the high amount of polyphenols and bioactive compounds in typical foods conforming this traditional dietary pattern.\n Few studies have suggested that genetic predisposition can modulate the relationship between polyphenols and T2D risk.\n In conclusion, the intake of polyphenols may be beneficial for both

Beginnings Trial conducted in southwestern Sydney, Australia.\n\n Dietary behaviours, including consumption of vegetables, fruit, water, milk, soft drinks, processed meat products, fast foods/take away and chips, were assessed using the New South Wales Health Survey questionnaire through face-to-face interviews.\n\n Factors associated with dietary behaviours were determined by logistic regression modeling.\n\n Log-binomial regression was used to calculate adjusted risk ratios (ARR).\n\n\nResults\nOnly 7% of mothers reported meeting the recommended vegetable consumption and 13% reported meeting the recommended fruit consumption.\n\n Mean and median intakes per day were 2.3 (SD 1.3) and 2 serves of vegetables, and 2.1 (SD 1.4) and 2 serves of fruit respectively.\n\n About one

Recent Evidence","abstract":"Nutritional status during pregnancy can have a significant impact on maternal and neonatal health outcomes.\n Requirements for macronutrients such as energy and protein increase during pregnancy to maintain maternal homeostasis while supporting foetal growth.\n Energy restriction can limit gestational weight gain in women with obesity; however, there is insufficient evidence to support energy restriction during pregnancy.\n In undernourished women, balanced energy/protein supplementation may increase birthweight whereas high protein supplementation could have adverse effects on foetal growth.\n Modulating carbohydrate intake via a reduced glycaemic index or glycaemic load diet may prevent gestational diabetes and large-for-gestational-age infants.\n Certain micronutrients are also vital for improving pregnancy outcomes, including folic acid to prevent neural tube defects and iodine to prevent cretinism.\n Newly published studies support the use of calcium supplementation to prevent hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly in women at high risk or with low dietary calcium intake.\n Although gaps in knowledge remain, research linking nutrition during pregnancy to maternofoetal outcomes has made dramatic advances over the last few years.\n In this review, we provide an overview of the most recent evidence pertaining to macronutrient and micronutrient requirements during pregnancy, the risks and consequences of deficiencies and the effects of supplementation on pregnancy outcomes.\n","id":"PMC6413112","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Aya","surname":"Mousa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amreen","surname":"Naqash","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amreen","surname":"Naqash","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Siew","surname":"Lim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Siew","surname":"Lim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"valor

were compared using multivariate analyses controlling for confounding variables.\n\n\nResults\nCompared to normoweight, overweight and obese women have greater risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (RR?=?2.13 (95% CI: 1.52–2.98) and (RR?=?2.85 (95% CI: 2.01–4.04), gestational hypertension (RR?=?2.01 (95% CI: 1.27–3.19) and (RR?=?4.79 (95% CI: 3.13–7.32) and preeclampsia (RR?=?3.16 (95% CI:

positively associated with risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pregnancy-induced hypertension, caesarean delivery, preterm delivery, large-for-gestational age infant (LGA), and macrosomia, and inversely associated with risks of small-for-gestational age infant (SGA) and low birth weight.\n\n Maternal excessive GWG was associated with increased risks of pregnancy-induced hypertension,

of smoking during pregnancy in a five-year period and the determinants of smoking cessation during pregnancy in Cantabria.\n\n\nMethods\nA 1/6 random sample of all women delivering at the reference hospital of the region for the period 1998–2002 was drawn, 1559 women.\n\n Information was obtained from personal interview, clinical chart, and prenatal care records.\n\n In the analysis relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated.\n\n Multivariable analysis was carried out using stepwise logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nSmoking prior to pregnancy decreased from 53.6% in 1998 to 39.4% in 2002. A decrease in smoking cessation among women smoking at the beginning of pregnancy was observed, from 37.3% in 1998 to 20.6% in 2002. The mean number of cigarettes/day (cig/d) before pregnancy remained constant, around 16 cig/d, whereas a slight trend to increase over time was seen, from 7.7 to 8.9 cig/d.\n\n In univariate analysis two variables favoured significantly smoking cessation, although they were not included in the stepwise logistic regression analysis, a higher education level and to be married.\n\n The logistic regression model included five significant predictors (also significant in univariate analysis): intensity of smoking, number of previous pregnancies, partner's smoking status, calendar year of study period (these four variables favoured smoking continuation), and adequate prenatal care (which increased smoking cessation).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe frequency of smoking among pregnant women is very high in Cantabria.\n\n As smoking cessation rate has decreased over time, a change in prenatal care programme on smoking counseling is needed.\n\n Several determinants of smoking cessation, such as smoking before pregnancy and partner's smoking, should be also addressed by community programmes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1868717","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Silvia","surname":"Palma","email":"spalma@ujaen.es","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rocio","surname":"Pérez-Iglesias","email":"perez-iglesias@telefonica.net","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rosa","surname":"Pardo-Crespo","email":"erodrigoc@ono.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Javier","surname":"Llorca","email":"llorcaj@unican.es","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marcial","surname":"Mariscal","email":"mariscal@ujaen.es","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Miguel","surname":"Delgado-Rodríguez","email":"mdelgado@ujaen.es","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Socio-cultural,

misclassification in pregnant women from INMA (INfancia y Medio Ambiente, Environment and Childhood) project, Spain, and to assess the optimal cut-offs for urinary cotinine (UC) that best distinguish daily and occasional smokers with varying levels of second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure.\n\n\nDesign\nWe used logistic regression models to study the relationship between sociodemographic variables and self-reported smoking and misclassification (self-reported non-smokers with UC &gt;50?ng/ml).\n\n Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to calculate the optimal cut-off point for discriminating smokers.\n\n The cut-offs were also calculated after stratification among non-smokers by the number of sources of SHS exposure.\n\n The cut-off points used to discriminate smoking status were the level of UC given by Youden's index and for 50 and 100?ng/ml for daily smokers, or 25 and 50?ng/ml for occasional smokers.\n\n\nParticipants\nAt the third trimester of pregnancy, 2263 pregnant women of the INMA Project were interviewed between 2004 and 2008 and a urine sample was collected.\n\n\nResults\nPrevalence of self-reported smokers at the third trimester of pregnancy was 18.5%, and another 3.9% misreported their smoking status.\n\n Variables associated with self-reported smoking and misreporting were similar, including born in Europe, educational level and exposure to SHS.\n\n The optimal cut-off was 82?ng/ml (95% CI 42 to 133), sensitivity 95.2% and specificity 96.6%.\n\n The area under the ROC curve was 0.986 (95% CI 0.982 to 0.990).\n\n The cut-offs varied according to the SHS exposure level being 42 (95% CI 27 to 57), 82 (95% CI 46 to 136) and 106?ng/ml (95% CI 58 to 227) for not being SHS exposed, exposed to one, and to two or more sources of SHS, respectively.\n\n The optimal cut-off for discriminating occasional smokers from non-smokers was 27?ng/ml (95% CI 11 to 43).\n\n\nConclusions\nPrevalence of smoking during pregnancy in Spain remains

Mortality?","abstract":"Background\nLittle is known about the effect of physical exercise on influenza-associated mortality.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nWe collected information about exercise habits and other lifestyles, and socioeconomic and demographic status, the underlying cause of death of 24,656 adults (21% aged 30–64, 79% aged 65 or above) who died in 1998 in Hong Kong, and the weekly proportion of specimens positive for influenza A (H3N1 and H1N1) and B isolations during the same period.\n\n We assessed the excess risks (ER) of influenza-associated mortality due to all-natural causes, cardiovascular diseases, or respiratory disease among different levels of exercise: never/seldom (less than once per month), low/moderate (once per month to three times per week), and frequent (four times or more per week) by Poisson regression.\n\n We also assessed the differences in ER between exercise groups by case-only logistic regression.\n\n For all the mortality outcomes under study in relation to each 10% increase in weekly proportion of specimens positive for influenza A+B, never/seldom exercise (as reference) was associated with 5.8% to 8.5% excess risks (ER) of mortality (P&lt;0.0001), while low/moderate exercise was associated with ER which were 4.2% to 6.4% lower than those of the reference (P&lt;0.001 for all-natural causes; P?=?0.001 for cardiovascular; and P?=?0.07 for respiratory mortality).\n\n Frequent exercise was not different from the reference (change in ER ?0.8% to 1.7%, P?=?0.30 to 0.73).\n\n\nConclusion\nWhen compared with never or seldom exercise, exercising at low to moderate frequency is beneficial with lower influenza-associated mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2329855","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chit-Ming","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hak-Kan","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chun-Quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sai-Yin","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"King-Pan","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thuan-Quoc","surname":"Thach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuen-Kwan","surname":"Chau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tai-Hing","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anthony

first, holistic immunological model of COVID?19: Implications for prevention, diagnosis, and public health measures","abstract":"The natural history of COVID?19 caused by SARS?CoV?2 is extremely variable, ranging from asymptomatic or mild infection, mainly in children, to multi?organ failure, eventually fatal, mainly in the eldest.\n We propose here the first model explaining how the outcome of first, crucial 10?15 days after infection, depends on the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, mannose?binding lectin).\n If SARS?CoV?2 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens.\n The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high?affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm), leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal.\n Low?moderate physical activity can still be recommended.\n However, extreme physical activity and oral breathing with hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID?19 facilitates re?inhalation and early direct penetration of high numbers of own virus particles in the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airway’s mucosae covered by neutralizing antibodies ('viral auto?inhalation' phenomenon).\n This allows the virus to bypass the efficient immune barrier of the upper airway mucosa in already infected, young, and otherwise healthy athletes.\n In conclusion, whether the virus or the adaptive immune response reaches the lungs first is a crucial factor deciding the fate of the patient.\n This “quantitative and time?/sequence?dependent” model has several implications for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID?19 at all ages.\n","id":"PMC7267459","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paolo

Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point.\n\n The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms.\n\n Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups.\n\n\nResults\nPregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.\n\n02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration.\n\n These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.\n\n005).\n\n The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.\n\n003), suspected infections (P=.\n\n004), and deaths per day (P=.\n\n001).\n\n Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak.\n\n\nConclusion\nMajor life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm.\n\n Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7211756","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yanting","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Han","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chenchi","surname":"Duan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cheng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianxia","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hualin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiangjuan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeping","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiufeng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yiping","surname":"You","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongmei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuangqi","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoling","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yajuan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haihong","surname":"Lao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Wen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junying","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuhua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Diyun","surname":"Meng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jingli","surname":"Zhai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Youchun","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qinwen","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiuping","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xifeng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cindy-Lee","surname":"Dennis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"He-feng","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References

Controlled Trial","abstract":"Background\nInternet-based interventions are a promising strategy for promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors.\n\n These have a tremendous potential for delivering electronic health interventions in scalable and cost-effective ways.\n\n There is strong evidence that the use of these programs can lead to weight loss and can lower patients’ average blood pressure (BP) levels.\n\n So far, few studies have investigated the effects of internet-based programs on patients who are obese with hypertension (HTN).\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the short- and long-term efficacy, in terms of body composition and BP parameters, of a self-administered internet-based intervention involving different modules and learning techniques aimed at promoting lifestyle changes (both physical activity and healthy eating) in patients who are obese with HTN.\n\n\nMethods\nA randomized wait-list controlled trial design was used.\n\n We recruited 105 adults with HTN who were overweight or obese and randomly assigned them to either a 3-month internet-based intervention group (n=55) or the wait-list control group (n=50).\n\n We assessed BMI (primary outcome), body fat mass (BFM), systolic (S)BP and diastolic (D)BP, blood glucose and insulin levels, physical activity levels, and functional capacity for aerobic exercise at Time 0 (preintervention) and Time 1 (postintervention).\n\n All the patients in the wait-list control group subsequently received the intervention, and a secondary within-group analysis, which also included these participants, was conducted at Time 2 (12-month follow-up).\n\n\nResults\nA 2-way mixed analysis of covariance showed a significant decrease in BMI, BFM, and blood glucose at 3 months in the internet-based intervention group; the effect size for the BMI and BFM parameters was moderate to large, and there was also a borderline significant trend for DBP and insulin.\n\n These results were either maintained or improved upon at Time 2 and showed significant changes for BMI (mean difference ?0.4, 95% CI ?0.1 to ?0.6; P=.\n\n005), BFM (mean difference ?2.4, 95% CI ?1.1 to ?3.6;

index and cause-specific mortality in 900?000 adults: collaborative analyses of 57 prospective studies","abstract":"Background\nThe main associations of body-mass index (BMI) with overall and cause-specific mortality can best be assessed by long-term prospective follow-up of large numbers of people.\n\n The Prospective Studies Collaboration aimed to investigate these associations by sharing data from many studies.\n\n\nMethods\nCollaborative analyses were undertaken of baseline BMI versus mortality in 57 prospective studies with 894?576 participants, mostly in western Europe and North America (61% [n=541?452] male, mean recruitment age 46 [SD 11] years, median recruitment year 1979 [IQR 1975–85], mean BMI 25 [SD 4] kg/m2).\n\n The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and study.\n\n To limit reverse causality, the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded, leaving 66?552 deaths of known cause during a mean of 8 (SD 6) further years of follow-up (mean age at death 67 [SD 10] years): 30?416 vascular; 2070 diabetic, renal or hepatic; 22?592 neoplastic; 3770 respiratory; 7704 other.\n\n\nFindings\nIn both sexes, mortality was lowest at about 22·5–25 kg/m2.\n\n Above this range, positive associations were recorded for several specific causes and inverse associations for none, the absolute excess risks for higher BMI and smoking were roughly additive, and each 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was on average associated with about 30% higher overall mortality (hazard ratio per 5 kg/m2 [HR] 1·29 [95% CI 1·27–1·32]): 40% for vascular mortality (HR 1·41 [1·37–1·45]); 60–120% for diabetic, renal, and hepatic mortality (HRs 2·16 [1·89–2·46], 1·59 [1·27–1·99], and 1·82 [1·59–2·09], respectively); 10% for neoplastic mortality (HR 1·10 [1·06–1·15]); and 20% for respiratory and for all other mortality (HRs 1·20 [1·07–1·34] and 1·20 [1·16–1·25], respectively).\n\n Below the range 22·5–25 kg/m2, BMI was associated inversely with overall mortality, mainly because of strong inverse associations with respiratory disease and lung cancer.\n\n These inverse associations were much stronger for smokers than for non-smokers, despite cigarette consumption per smoker varying little with BMI.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAlthough other anthropometric measures (eg, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) could well add extra information to BMI, and BMI to them, BMI is in itself a strong predictor of overall mortality both above and below the apparent optimum of about 22·5–25 kg/m2.\n\n The progressive excess mortality above this range is due mainly to vascular disease and is probably largely causal.\n\n At 30–35 kg/m2, median survival is reduced by 2–4 years; at 40–45 kg/m2, it is reduced by 8–10 years (which is comparable with the effects of smoking).\n\n The definite excess mortality below 22·5 kg/m2 is due mainly to smoking-related diseases, and is not fully explained.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Medical Research Council, British Heart

African Americans and could be reduced through diet and physical activity interventions.\n\n Our objective was to systematically review the literature on clinical outcomes of diet and physical activity interventions conducted among adult African American populations in the United States.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta Analysis construct in our review.\n\n We searched Medline (PubMed and Ovid), Cochrane, and DARE databases and restricted our search to articles published in English from January 2000 through December 2011. We included studies of educational interventions with clinically relevant outcomes and excluded studies that dealt with nonadult populations or populations with pre-existing catabolic or other complicated disorders, that did not focus on African Americans, that provided no quantitative baseline or follow-up data, or that included no diet or physical activity education or intervention.\n\n We report retention and attendance rates, study setting, program sustainability, behavior theory, and education components.\n\n\nResults\nNineteen studies were eligible for closer analysis.\n\n These studies described interventions for improving diet or physical activity as indicators of health promotion and disease prevention and that reported significant improvement in clinical outcomes.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur review suggests that nutrition and physical activity educational interventions can be successful in improving clinically relevant outcomes among African Americans in the United States.\n\n Further research is needed to study the cost and sustainability of lifestyle interventions.\n\n Further studies should also include serum biochemical parameters to substantiate more specifically the effect of interventions on preventing chronic disease and reducing its incidence and

overweight and obesity is on the rise worldwide with severe physical and psychosocial consequences.\n\n One of the most dangerous is hypertension.\n\n Lifestyle changes related to eating behaviour and physical activity are the critical components in the prevention and treatment of hypertension and obesity.\n\n Data indicates that the usual procedures to promote these healthy habits in health services are either insufficient or not efficient enough.\n\n Internet has been shown to be an effective tool for the implementation of lifestyle interventions based on this type of problem.\n\n This study aims to assess the efficacy of a totally self-administered online intervention programme versus the usual medical care for obese and overweight participants with hypertension (from the Spanish public health care system) to promote healthy lifestyles (eating behaviour and physical activity).\n\n\nMethod\nA randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 100 patients recruited from the hypertension unit of a public hospital.\n\n Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a) SII: a self-administered Internet-based intervention protocol; and b) MUC-medical usual care.\n\n The online intervention is an Internet-delivered, multimedia, interactive, self-administered programme, composed of nine modules designed to promote healthy eating habits and increase physical activity.\n\n The first five modules will be activated at a rate of one per week, and access for modules 5 to 9 will open every two weeks.\n\n Patients will be assessed at four points: before the intervention, after the intervention (3 months), and at 6 and 12 months (follow-up).\n\n The outcome variables will include blood pressure, and Body Mass Index, as primary outcome measures, and quality of life and other lifestyle and anthropometrical variables as secondary outcome measures.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe literature highlights the need for more studies on the benefits of using the Internet to promote lifestyle interventions.\n\n This study aims to investigate the efficiency of a totally self-administered Internet???+based programme for promoting healthy habits and improving the

(CV) wellness interventions though little is known about the cardiovascular health outcomes of these programs.\n\n In this review, we examined the effectiveness of internet-based employee cardiovascular wellness and prevention programs.\n\n\nEvidence Acquisition\nWe conducted a systematic review by searching PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane library for all published studies on internet-based programs aimed at improving CV health among employees up to November 2012. We grouped the outcomes according to the American Heart Association (AHA) indicators of cardiovascular wellbeing – weight, BP, lipids, smoking, physical activity, diet, and blood glucose.\n\n\nEvidence Synthesis\nA total of 18 randomized trials and 11 follow-up studies met our inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\n Follow-up duration ranged from 6 – 24 months.\n\n There were significant differences in intervention types and number of components in each intervention.\n\n Modest improvements were observed in more than half of the studies with weight related outcomes while no improvement was seen in virtually all the studies with physical activity outcome.\n\n In general, internet-based programs were more successful if the interventions also included some physical contact and environmental modification, and if they were targeted at specific disease entities such as hypertension.\n\n Only a few of the studies were conducted in persons at-risk for CVD, none in blue-collar workers or low-income earners.\n\n\nConclusion\nInternet based programs hold promise for improving the cardiovascular wellness among employees however much work is required to fully understand its utility and long term impact especially in special/at-risk populations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3885454","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ehimen

of Internet-Based Interventions on Waist Circumference Reduction: A Meta-Analysis","abstract":"Background\nInternet-based interventions are more cost-effective than conventional interventions and can provide immediate, easy-to-access, and individually tailored support for behavior change.\n\n Waist circumference is a strong predictor of an increased risk for a host of diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, independent of body mass index.\n\n To date, no study has examined the effect of Internet-based lifestyle interventions on waist circumference change.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aimed to systematically review the effect of Internet-based interventions on waist circumference change among adults.\n\n\nMethods\nThis meta-analysis reviewed randomized controlled trials (N=31 trials and 8442 participants) that used the Internet as a main intervention approach and reported changes in waist circumference.\n\n\nResults\nInternet-based interventions showed a significant reduction in waist circumference (mean change –2.99 cm, 95% CI ?3.68 to ?2.30, I2=93.3%) and significantly better effects on waist circumference loss (mean loss 2.38 cm, 95% CI 1.61-3.25, I2=97.2%) than minimal interventions such as information-only groups.\n\n Meta-regression results showed that baseline waist circumference, gender, and the presence of social support in the intervention were significantly associated with waist circumference reduction.\n\n\nConclusions\nInternet-based interventions have a significant and promising effect on waist circumference change.\n\n Incorporating social support into an Internet-based intervention appears to be useful in reducing waist circumference.\n\n Considerable heterogeneity exists among the effects of Internet-based interventions.\n\n The design of an intervention may have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the

Search terms included cardiovascular risk factors and diseases (specified), Web-based interventions (and synonyms) and randomized controlled trial.\n\n Two authors independently performed study

Older Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial","abstract":"Background\nLack of physical activity leads to detrimental changes in body composition and metabolism, functional decline, and increased risk of disease in old age.\n\n The potential of Web-assisted interventions for increasing physical activity and improving metabolism in older individuals holds great promise but to our knowledge it has not been studied.\n\n\nObjective\nThe goal of our study was to assess whether a Web-based intervention increases physical activity and improves metabolic health in inactive older adults.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a 3-month randomized, waitlist-controlled trial in a volunteer sample of 235 inactive adults aged 60-70 years without diabetes.\n\n The intervention group received the Internet program Philips DirectLife, which was directed at increasing physical activity using monitoring and feedback by accelerometer and digital coaching.\n\n The primary outcome was relative increase in physical activity measured objectively using ankle- and wrist-worn accelerometers.\n\n Secondary outcomes of metabolic health included anthropometric measures and parameters of glucose metabolism.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 226 participants (97%) completed the study.\n\n At the ankle, activity counts increased by 46% (standard error [SE] 7%) in the intervention group, compared to 12% (SE 3%) in the control group (P\ndifference&lt;.\n\n001).\n\n Measured at the wrist, activity counts increased by 11% (SE 3%) in the intervention group and 5% (SE 2%) in the control group (P\ndifference=.\n\n11).\n\n After processing of the data, this corresponded to a daily increase of 11 minutes in moderate-to-vigorous activity in the intervention group versus 0 minutes in the control group (P\ndifference=.\n\n001).\n\n Weight decreased significantly more in the intervention group compared to controls (?1.5 kg vs ?0.8 kg respectively, P=.\n\n046), as did waist circumference (?2.3 cm vs ?1.3 cm respectively, P=.\n\n036) and fat mass (?0.6% vs 0.07% respectively, P=.\n\n025).\n\n Furthermore, insulin and HbA1c levels were significantly more reduced in the intervention group compared to controls (both P&lt;.\n\n05).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis was the first study to show that in inactive older adults, a 3-month Web-based physical activity intervention was effective in increasing objectively measured daily physical activity and improving metabolic health.\n\n Such Web-based interventions provide novel opportunities for large scale prevention of metabolic

Literature","abstract":"Background\n Nowadays people are extensively encouraged to become more physically active.\n\n The Internet has been brought forward as an effective tool to change physical activity behavior.\n\n However, little is known about the evidence regarding such Internet-based interventions.\n\n\nObjective\n The aim of the study was to systematically assess the methodological quality and the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote physical activity by means of the Internet as evaluated by randomized controlled trials.\n\n\nMethods\n A literature search was conducted up to July 2006 using the databases PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library.\n\n Only randomized controlled trials describing the effectiveness of an Internet-based intervention, with the promotion of physical activity among adults being one of its major goals, were included.\n\n Data extracted included source and year of publication, country of origin, targeted health behaviors, participants’ characteristics, characteristics of the intervention, and effectiveness data.\n\n In addition, the methodological quality was assessed.\n\n\nResults\n The literature search resulted in 10 eligible studies of which five met at least nine out of 13 general methodological criteria.\n\n The majority of the interventions were tailored to the characteristics of the participants and used interactive self-monitoring and feedback tools.\n\n Six studies used one or more theoretical models to compose the contents of the interventions.\n\n One study used an objective measure to assess the amount of physical activity (activity monitor), and six studies used multiple subjective measures of physical activity.\n\n Furthermore, half of the studies employed measures of physical fitness other than physical activity.\n\n In three studies, an Internet-based physical activity intervention was compared with a waiting list group.\n\n Of these three studies, two reported a significantly greater improvement in physical activity levels in the Internet-based intervention than in the control group.\n\n Seven studies compared two types of Internet-based physical activity interventions in which the main difference was either the intensity of contact between the participants and supervisors (4 studies) or the type of treatment procedures applied (3 studies).\n\n In one of these studies, a significant effect in favor of an intervention with more supervisor contact was seen.\n\n\nConclusions\n There is indicative evidence that Internet-based physical activity interventions are more effective than a waiting list strategy.\n\n The added value of specific components of Internet-based physical activity interventions such as increased supervisor contact, tailored information, or theoretical fidelity remains to be established.\n\n Methodological quality as well as the type of physical activity outcome measure varied, stressing the need for standardization of these measures.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2047289","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marleen H","surname":"van den

Is eHealth (4): A Scoping Exercise to Map the Field","abstract":"Background\n Lack of consensus on the meaning of eHealth has led to uncertainty among academics, policymakers, providers and consumers.\n\n This project was commissioned in light of the rising profile of eHealth on the international policy agenda and the emerging UK National Programme for Information Technology (now called Connecting for Health) and related developments in the UK National Health Service.\n\n\nObjectives\n To map the emergence and scope of eHealth as a topic and to identify its place within the wider health informatics field, as part of a larger review of research and expert analysis pertaining to current evidence, best practice and future trends.\n\n\nMethods\n Multiple databases of scientific abstracts were explored in a nonsystematic fashion to assess the presence of eHealth or conceptually related terms within their taxonomies, to identify journals in which articles explicitly referring to eHealth are contained and the topics covered, and to identify published definitions of the concept.\n\n The databases were Medline (PubMed), the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Science Citation Index (SCI), the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), the Cochrane Database (including Dare, Central, NHS Economic Evaluation Database [NHS EED], Health Technology Assessment [HTA] database, NHS EED bibliographic) and ISTP (now known as ISI proceedings).\n\nWe used the search query, “Ehealth OR e-health OR e*health”.\n\n The timeframe searched was 1997-2003, although some analyses contain data emerging subsequent to this period.\n\n This was supplemented by iterative searches of Web-based sources, such as commercial and policy reports, research commissioning programmes and electronic news pages.\n\n Definitions extracted from both searches were thematically analyzed and compared in order to assess conceptual heterogeneity.\n\n\nResults\n The term eHealth only came into use in the year 2000, but has since become widely prevalent.\n\n The scope of the topic was not immediately discernable from that of the wider health informatics field, for which over 320000 publications are listed in Medline alone, and it is not explicitly represented within the existing Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) taxonomy.\n\n Applying eHealth as narrative search term to multiple databases yielded 387 relevant articles, distributed across 154 different journals, most commonly related to information technology and telemedicine, but extending to such areas as law.\n\n Most eHealth articles are represented on Medline.\n\n Definitions of eHealth vary with respect to the functions, stakeholders, contexts and theoretical issues targeted.\n\n Most encompass a broad range of medical informatics applications either specified (eg, decision support, consumer health information) or presented in more general terms (eg, to manage, arrange or deliver health care).\n\n However the majority emphasize the communicative functions of eHealth and specify the use of networked digital technologies, primarily the Internet, thus differentiating eHealth from the field of medical informatics.\n\n While some definitions explicitly target health professionals or patients, most encompass applications for all stakeholder groups.\n\n The nature of the scientific and broader literature pertaining to eHealth closely reflects these conceptualizations.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe surmise that the field – as it stands today – may be characterized by the global definitions suggested by Eysenbach and Eng.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1550637","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Claudia","surname":"Pagliari","email":"claudia.pagliari@ed.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Sloan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Gregor","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frank","surname":"Sullivan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Don","surname":"Detmer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James

Adherence in an Internet-Mediated Walking Program. Part 1: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial","abstract":"Background\n Approximately half of American adults do not meet recommended physical activity guidelines.\n\n Face-to-face lifestyle interventions improve health outcomes but are unlikely to yield population-level improvements because they can be difficult to disseminate, expensive to maintain, and inconvenient for the recipient.\n\n In contrast, Internet-based behavior change interventions can be disseminated widely at a lower cost.\n\n However, the impact of some Internet-mediated programs is limited by high attrition rates.\n\n Online communities that allow participants to communicate with each other by posting and reading messages may decrease participant attrition.\n\n\nObjective\n Our objective was to measure the impact of adding online community features to an Internet-mediated walking program on participant attrition and average daily step counts.\n\n\nMethods\n This randomized controlled trial included sedentary, ambulatory adults who used email regularly and had at least 1 of the following: overweight (body mass index [BMI] ? 25), type 2 diabetes, or coronary artery disease.\n\n All participants (n = 324) wore enhanced pedometers throughout the 16-week intervention and uploaded step-count data to the study server.\n\n Participants could log in to the study website to view graphs of their walking progress, individually-tailored motivational messages, and weekly calculated goals.\n\n Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 versions of a Web-based walking program.\n\n Those randomized to the “online community” arm could post and read messages with other participants while those randomized to the “no online community' arm could not read or post messages.\n\n The main outcome measures were participant attrition and average daily step counts over 16 weeks.\n\n Multiple regression analyses assessed the effect of the online community access controlling for age, sex, disease status, BMI, and baseline step counts.\n\n\nResults\n Both arms significantly increased their average daily steps between baseline and the end of the intervention period, but there were no significant differences in increase in step counts between arms using either intention-to-treat or completers analysis.\n\n In the intention-to-treat analysis, the average step count increase across both arms was 1888 ± 2400 steps.\n\n The percentage of completers was 13% higher in the online community arm than the no online community arm (online community arm, 79%, no online community arm, 66%, P = .\n\n02).\n\n In addition, online community arm participants remained engaged in the program longer than no online community arm participants (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.25 - 0.90, P = .\n\n02).\n\n Participants with lower baseline social support posted more messages to the online community (P &lt; .\n\n001) and viewed more posts (P &lt; .\n\n001) than participants with higher baseline social support.\n\n\nConclusion\n Adding online community features to an Internet-mediated walking program did not increase average daily step counts but did reduce participant attrition.\n\n Participants with low baseline social support used the online community features more than those with high baseline social support.\n\n Thus, online communities may be a promising approach to reducing attrition from online health behavior change interventions, particularly in populations with low social support.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nNCT00729040;

and public health problems of our time: it increases the risk of many health complications such as hypertension, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes, needs long-lasting treatment for effective results and involves high public and private costs.\n\n Therefore, it is imperative that enduring and low-cost clinical programs for obesity and related co-morbidities are developed and evaluated.\n\n\nMethods/Design\nTECNOB (TEChnology for OBesity) is a comprehensive two-phase stepped down program enhanced by telemedicine for the long-term treatment of obese people with type 2 diabetes seeking intervention for weight loss.\n\n Its core features are the hospital-based intensive treatment (1-month), that consists of diet therapy, physical training and psychological counseling, and the continuity of care at home using new information and communication technologies (ICT) such as internet and mobile phones.\n\n The effectiveness of the TECNOB program compared with usual care (hospital-based treatment only) will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 12-month follow-up.\n\n The primary outcome is weight in kilograms.\n\n Secondary outcome measures are energy expenditure measured using an electronic armband, glycated hemoglobin, binge eating, self-efficacy in eating and weight control, body satisfaction, healthy habit formation, disordered eating-related behaviors and cognitions, psychopathological symptoms and weight-related quality of life.\n\n Furthermore, the study will explore what behavioral and psychological variables are predictive of treatment success among those we have considered.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe TECNOB study aims to inform the evidence-based knowledge of how telemedicine may enhance the effectiveness of clinical interventions for weight loss and related type-2 diabetes, and which type of obese patients may benefit the most from such interventions.\n\n Broadly, the study aims also to have a effect on the theoretical model behind the traditional health care service, in favor of a change towards a new 'health care everywhere' approach.\n\n\nTrial registration\nCurrent Controlled Trials

Person-Based Approach to Intervention Development: Application to Digital Health-Related Behavior Change Interventions","abstract":"This paper describes an approach that we have evolved for developing successful digital interventions to help people manage their health or illness.\n We refer to this as the “person-based” approach to highlight the focus on understanding and accommodating the perspectives of the people who will use the intervention.\n While all intervention designers seek to elicit and incorporate the views of target users in a variety of ways, the person-based approach offers a distinctive and systematic means of addressing the user experience of intended behavior change techniques in particular and can enhance the use of theory-based and evidence-based approaches to intervention development.\n There are two key elements to the person-based approach.\n The first is a developmental process involving qualitative research with a wide range of people from the target user populations, carried out at every stage of intervention development, from planning to feasibility testing and implementation.\n This process goes beyond assessing acceptability, usability, and satisfaction, allowing the intervention designers to build a deep understanding of the psychosocial context of users and their views of the behavioral elements of the intervention.\n Insights from this process can be used to anticipate and interpret intervention usage and outcomes, and most importantly to modify the intervention to make it more persuasive, feasible, and relevant to users.\n The second element of the person-based approach is to identify “guiding principles” that can inspire and inform the intervention development by highlighting the distinctive ways that the intervention will address key context-specific behavioral issues.\n This paper describes how to implement the person-based approach, illustrating the process with examples of the insights gained from our experience of

inactivity increases the risk of global death; however, the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown strategy on physical activity (PA) remains unclear.\n This study compared PA—i.\ne.\n, daily occupation, transportation to and from daily occupation, leisure time activities, and regular sporting activities—prior (PRE) and during (POST) the on-going COVID-19 outbreak in the Greece lockdown environment.\n A Greek version of the web-based Active-Q questionnaire was used to access PA.\n The questionnaire was filled out twice (once each for the PRE and POST conditions) by 8495 participants (age = 37.2 ± 0.2 years (95% confidence interval (CI), 36.9–37.5); males = 38.3% (95%CI, 36.7–40.0); females = 61.7% (95%CI, 60.4–63.0).\n The relative frequency of overall sporting activities, which, prior to lockdown, occurred at least once per month, and overall participation in competitive sports was significantly reduced (8.6% (95%CI, 7.9–9.3) and 84.7% (95%CI, 82.9–86.6) respectively).\n With the exception of overall leisure time activities, which were significantly increased in the POST condition, daily occupational, transportation, and sporting activities significant reduced (p &lt; 0.05).\n Overall PA was reduced in all genders, age, body mass index (BMI) and PA level subgroups in the POST condition, and an interaction between the males and High PA subgroups was observed.\n The change in overall PA (from PRE to POST conditions) was ?16.3% (95%CI, ?17.3 to ?15.4), while in daily occupational, transportation, and sporting activities, it was ?52.9% (95%CI, ?54.8–51.0), ?41.1% (95%CI, ?42.8–39.5) and ?23.9% (95%CI, ?25.1–22.8), respectively.\n Thus, the lockdown period is highly associated with a negative change in overall PA.\n During lockdown, inactivity increased dramatically, with males and the high PA population affected significantly more.\n The decline in PA is a great concern due to possible long-term consequences on public health and healthcare system.\n","id":"PMC7589063","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_Core_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dimitrios

coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility.\n Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence.\n We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases.\n Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review.\n Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger.\n Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma.\n Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects.\n In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided.\n Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.\n","id":"PMC7158942","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Samantha K","surname":"Brooks","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rebecca

health outcomes.\n\n\nObjective\nTo validate the Web-based physical activity questionnaire Active-Q by comparing results of time spent at different physical activity levels with results from the GENEA accelerometer and to assess the reproducibility of Active-Q by comparing two admissions of the questionnaire.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 148 men (aged 33 to 86 years) responded to Active-Q twice and wore the accelerometer during seven consecutive days on two occasions.\n\n Time spent on six different physical activity levels including sedentary, light (LPA), moderate (MPA), and vigorous (VPA) as well as additional combined categories of sedentary-to-light and moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) physical activity was assessed.\n\n Validity of Active-Q was determined using Spearman correlation coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the Bland-Altman method.\n\n Reproducibility was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) comparing two admissions of the

studies.\n\n The aim of our new Web-based questionnaire, Active-Q, is to assess total physical activity and inactivity in adults.\n\n Active-Q assesses habitual activity during the past year via questions in four different domains: (1) daily occupation, (2) transportation to and from daily occupation, (3) leisure time activities, and (4) sporting activities.\n\n\nObjective\nThe objective of our study is to validate Active-Q’s energy expenditure estimates using the doubly labeled water (DLW) method, and to assess the reproducibility of Active-Q by comparing the results of the questionnaire completed by the same group on two occasions.\n\n\nMethods\nThe validity and reproducibility of Active-Q were assessed in a group of 37 individuals, aged 20 to 65 years.\n\n Active-Q was distributed via email to the participants.\n\n The total energy expenditure of the participants was assessed using DLW for 11 consecutive days.\n\n\nResults\nThe median time to complete Active-Q was 6.1 minutes.\n\n The majority of participants (27/37, 73%) reported that the questionnaire was “easy” or “very easy” to answer.\n\n On average, Active-Q overestimated the total daily energy

activity.\n\n Several studies validating the IPAQ-SF have been conducted with differing results, but no systematic review of these studies has been reported.\n\n\nMethods\nThe keywords 'IPAQ', 'validation', and 'validity' were searched in PubMed and Scopus.\n\n Studies published in English that validated the IPAQ-SF against an objective physical activity measuring device, doubly labeled water, or an objective fitness measure were included.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-three validation studies were included in this review.\n\n There was a great deal of variability in the methods used across studies, but the results were largely similar.\n\n Correlations between the total physical activity level measured by the IPAQ-SF and objective standards ranged from 0.09 to 0.39; none reached the minimal acceptable standard in the literature (0.50 for objective activity measuring devices, 0.40 for fitness measures).\n\n Correlations between sections of the IPAQ-SF for vigorous activity or moderate activity level/walking and an objective standard showed even greater variability (-0.18 to 0.76), yet several reached the minimal acceptable standard.\n\n Only six studies provided comparisons between physical activity levels derived from the IPAQ-SF and those obtained from objective criterion.\n\n In most studies the IPAQ-SF overestimated physical activity level by 36 to 173 percent; one study underestimated by 28 percent.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe correlation between the IPAQ-SF and objective measures of activity or fitness in the large majority of studies was lower than the acceptable standard.\n\n Furthermore, the IPAQ-SF typically overestimated physical activity as measured by objective criterion by an average of 84 percent.\n\n Hence, the evidence to support the use of the IPAQ-SF as an indicator of relative or absolute physical activity is weak.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3214824","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paul

energy expenditure (PAEE), time at moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and sedentary time were measured using individually-calibrated combined heart-rate and movement sensing.\n\n At the second visit, RPAQ was administered electronically.\n\n Validity was assessed using agreement analysis.\n\n\nResults\nRPAQ significantly underestimated PAEE in women [median(IQR) 34.1 (22.1, 52.2) vs.\n\n 40.6 (32.4,

Longitudinal Ageing Study Amsterdam Physical Activity Questionnaire (LAPAQ) against a triaxial accelerometer (ACTR) (Sensewear® Pro) in older adults.\n\n\nMethods\nParticipants wore the ACTR continuously for two weeks.\n\n After 2 (T [time] = 1) and 4 (T = 2) weeks, participants completed the LAPAQ.\n\n Since the LAPAQ asks about 2 weeks’ worth of physical activity, the ACTR and LAPAQ coincided at T1. T2 was used to assess the reproducibility of the LAPAQ results only.\n\n We calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients (PCC) to examine reproducibility and validity.\n\n For visualization, we used scatterplots and Bland–Altman plots.\n\n With a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve we assessed how well the LAPAQ identifies older adults whose activity level is below official recommendations.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 89 persons were included.\n\n Of the participants, 48% were men; median age was 73, and median body mass index was 25. The 2-week mean total duration of activity was 2788 (ACTR, T = 1), 2439 (LAPAQ T = 1), and 1994 (LAPAQ T = 2) minutes.\n\n As a reference, 2 full weeks contained 20,160 minutes.\n\n Reproducibility of the LAPAQ was moderate (PCC 0.68, 95% CI 0.55–0.80).\n\n The median difference between LAPAQ at T = 1 and the ACTR (LAPAQ minus ACTR) was –510 minutes and the PCC was 0.25 (95% CI 0.07–0.44).\n\n The area under the ROC curve was 0.73 (95% CI 0.59–0.86).\n\n\nConclusion\nLAPAQ underestimates PA and seems unsuitable for exact measurement in older adults.\n\n However, it may be used to determine if a person’s PA level is below the recommended level.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3410686","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lara","surname":"Siebeling","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"Wiebers","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leo","surname":"Beem","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Milo A","surname":"Puhan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gerben","surname":"ter Riet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1249/MSS.0b013e3182399c0e","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Assessing physical activity using wearable monitors: measures of physical activity","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Repeatability and accuracy of CHAMPS as a measure of physical activity in a community sample of older Australian adults","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1249/MSS.0b013e3182399e5b","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Best practices for using physical activity monitors in population-based research","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1249/MSS.0b013e31827f0d9c","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Estimating activity and sedentary behavior from an accelerometer on the hip or wrist","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1249/MSS.0b013e3182965249","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Classification accuracy of the wrist-worn gravity estimator of normal everyday activity accelerometer","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1249/MSS.0b013e31823bf95c","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Physical activity classification using the GENEA wrist-worn accelerometer","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Conducting accelerometer-based activity assessments in field-based research","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1093/aje/kwm148","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The role of measurement error in estimating levels of physical activity","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.2196/jmir.1974","date":"2012-01-02","title":"Active-Q: Validation of the Web-Based Physical Activity Questionnaire Using Doubly Labeled Water","abstract":"Background\nIncreased use of the Internet provides new opportunities for collecting data in large studies.\n\n The aim of our new Web-based questionnaire, Active-Q, is to assess total physical activity and inactivity in adults.\n\n Active-Q assesses habitual activity during the past year via questions in four different domains: (1) daily occupation, (2) transportation to and from daily occupation, (3) leisure time activities, and (4) sporting activities.\n\n\nObjective\nThe objective of our study is to validate Active-Q’s energy expenditure estimates using the doubly labeled water (DLW) method, and to assess the reproducibility of Active-Q by comparing the results of the questionnaire completed by the same group on two occasions.\n\n\nMethods\nThe validity and reproducibility of Active-Q were assessed in a group of 37 individuals, aged 20 to 65 years.\n\n Active-Q was distributed via email to the participants.\n\n The total energy expenditure of the participants was assessed using DLW for 11 consecutive days.\n\n\nResults\nThe median time to complete Active-Q was 6.1 minutes.\n\n The majority of participants (27/37, 73%) reported that the questionnaire was “easy” or “very easy” to answer.\n\n On average, Active-Q overestimated the total daily energy expenditure by 440 kJ compared with the DLW.\n\n The Spearman correlation between the two methods was r = 0.52 (P &lt;

demonstrated good reliability, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.67 (household activity) to 0.89 (sports/recreation).\n Comparison between the L-PAQ and the LT-PAQ resulted in Spearman correlation coefficients ranging from 0.41 (total activity) to 0.71 (household activity); comparison between the L-PAQ and the CT-PAQ yielded coefficients of 0.58 (sports/recreation), 0.56

time: Physical activity datasets of four independent adult sample groups corresponding to each of the last four of the six COVID-19 lockdown weeks in Greece","abstract":"There is a worldwide interest in how lockdown affects physical activity (PA) during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Although it has been shown that the mandated stay-at-home restrictions and self-isolation measures applied in different countries were accosiated with a reduction in physical exercise and activity, such results derive from studying only specific periods of lockdown.\n However, in order for this hypothesis to be tested, consecutive lockdown periods need to be examined separately.\n In this study we focus on PA change in Greek adults over time, during each of the last four weeks of lockdown in Greece.\n The web-based Active-Q questionnaire (see Supplementary file 1_Active-Q) was used to collect data prior to the COVID-19 crisis (PRE condition) and during lockdown measures (POST condition).\n The period of data collection (5 April to 3 May 2020) was divided into four phases (Ph-I, Ph-II, Ph-III, Ph-V), corresponding to the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th lockdown week respectively (out of a six-week total lockdown).\n There were four independent groups of respondents (G-I, G-II, G-III, G-V) who reported their age, weight, height and usual PA habits.\n Energy expenditure (EE) was calculated (MET-min/week; see Supplementary file 2_Data) in four main different domains (daily occupation activities, means of transportation to and from daily occupation, leisure time and regular sporting activities; see Supplementary file 3_Corresponding MET values).\n Each group's dataset corresponded to one of the aforementioned phases (G-I to Ph-I, G-II to Ph-II, and so on).\n Overall PA change (from PRE to POST condition) ranged from -21.50% in G-I (Ph-I) to -5.03 in G-V (Ph-V); PA change in male subgroups ranged from -26.10% in Ph-I to -13.64 in Ph-V; in female subgroups it ranged from -17.42% in Ph-I to -1.39 in Ph-V.\n Although the decline in overall PA is evident in all groups during each lockdown phase (p&lt;0.05), the combination of our data demonstrates that towards the end of lockdown this decline showed a gradual decreasing tendency.\n","id":"PMC7483084","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dimitrios

policy challenges and vital in terms of addressing socioeconomic health inequalities.\n\n\nMethods\nNine electronic databases were searched from start date to October 2012 along with website and grey

available’ (strongest methodologically) international evidence.\n\n At the individual level (n?=?4), there was indicative evidence that screen time reduction and mentoring health promotion interventions could be effective in reducing inequalities in obesity.\n\n For the community level interventions (n?=?17), evidence was inconclusive - with some studies suggesting that school-based health promotion activities and community-based group-based programmes were effective in reducing obesity - others not.\n\n Societal level evaluations were few (n?=?1).\n\n However, there was no

activity, behavioral therapy, or any combination of these interventions) to prevent and manage childhood and adolescent obesity.\n We conducted a comprehensive literature search across various databases and grey literature without any restrictions on publication, language, or publication status until February 2020. We included randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies from both high income countries (HIC) and low-middle-income countries (LMICs).\n Participants were children and adolescents from 0 to 19 years of age.\n Studies conducted among hospitalized children and children with any pre-existing health conditions were excluded from this review.\n A total of 654 studies (1160 papers) that met the inclusion criteria were included in this review.\n A total of 359 studies targeted obesity prevention, 280 studies targeted obesity management, while 15 studies targeted both prevention and management.\n The majority of the studies (81%) were conducted in HICs, 10% of studies were conducted in upper middle income countries, while only 2% of the studies were conducted in LMICs.\n The most common setting for these interventions were communities and school settings.\n Evidence for the prevention of obesity among children and adolescents suggests that a combination of diet and exercise might reduce the BMI z-score (MD: ?0.12; 95% CI: ?0.18 to ?0.06; 32 studies; 33,039 participants; I2 93%; low quality evidence), body mass index (BMI) by 0.41 kg/m2 (MD: ?0.41 kg/m2; 95% CI: ?0.60 to ?0.21; 35 studies; 47,499 participants; I2 98%;

95% CI: ?0.25 to ?0.01; 5 studies; 1806 participants; I2 62%; low quality evidence) might reduce BMI z-score when compared to the control group.\n Evidence for obesity management suggests that exercise only interventions probably reduce BMI z-score (MD: ?0.13; 95% CI: ?0.20 to ?0.06; 12 studies; 1084 participants; I2 0%; moderate quality evidence), and might reduce BMI (MD: ?0.88; 95% CI: ?1.265 to ?0.50; 34 studies; 3846 participants; I2 72%) and body weight (MD: ?3.01; 95% CI: ?5.56 to ?0.47; 16 studies; 1701 participants; I2 78%; low quality evidence) when compared to the control group.\n and the exercise along with behavioral therapy interventions (MD: ?0.08; 95% CI: ?0.16 to ?0.00;

randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, and before-after studies were included.\n A comprehensive search strategy was implemented in five electronic databases: ASSIA, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Embase, Medline and Social Sciences Citation Index.\n The search was limited to English language abstracts published between January 2006 and January 2014.

Eligible studies tested the efficacy or effectiveness of D&amp;I strategies (i.\n\ne.\n\n, not effectiveness of the underlying clinical or public health intervention); had a comparison by group and/or time; and used ?1 quantitative measure.\n\n Several design elements were extracted: design category (e.\n\ng.\n\n, randomized); design type [e.\n\ng.\n\n, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT)]; data type (e.\n\ng.\n\n, quantitative); D&amp;I theoretical framework; levels of treatment assignment, intervention, and measurement; and country in which the research was conducted.\n\n Each protocol was double-coded, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 404 protocols reviewed, 212 (52%) studies tested one or more implementation strategy across 208 manuscripts,

lifestyle programme (WAVES intervention) compared with usual practice, in preventing childhood obesity.\n\n\nDesign\nCluster randomised controlled trial.\n\n\nSetting\nUK primary schools from the West Midlands.\n\n\nParticipants\n200 schools were randomly selected from all state run primary schools within 35 miles of the study centre (n=980), oversampling those with high minority ethnic populations.\n\n These schools were randomly ordered and sequentially invited to participate.\n\n 144 eligible schools were approached to achieve the target recruitment of 54 schools.\n\n After baseline measurements 1467 year 1 pupils aged 5 and 6 years (control: 28 schools, 778 pupils) were randomised, using a blocked balancing algorithm.\n\n 53 schools remained in the trial and data on 1287 (87.7%) and 1169 (79.7%) pupils were available at first follow-up (15 month) and second follow-up (30 month), respectively.\n\n\nInterventions\nThe 12 month intervention encouraged healthy eating and physical activity, including a daily additional 30 minute school time physical activity opportunity, a six week interactive skill based programme in conjunction with Aston Villa football club, signposting of local family physical activity opportunities through mail-outs every six months, and termly school led family workshops on healthy cooking skills.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nThe protocol defined primary outcomes, assessed blind to allocation, were between arm difference in body mass index (BMI) z score at 15 and 30 months.\n\n Secondary outcomes were further anthropometric, dietary, physical activity, and psychological measurements, and difference in BMI z score at 39 months in a subset.\n\n\nResults\nData for primary outcome analyses were: baseline, 54 schools: 1392 pupils (732 controls); first follow-up (15 months post-baseline), 53 schools: 1249 pupils (675 controls); second follow-up (30 months post-baseline), 53 schools: 1145 pupils (621 controls).\n\n The mean BMI z score was non-significantly lower in the intervention arm compared with the control arm at 15 months (mean difference ?0.075 (95% confidence interval ?0.183 to 0.033, P=0.18) in the baseline adjusted models.\n\n At 30 months the mean difference was ?0.027 (?0.137 to 0.083, P=0.63).\n\n There was no statistically significant difference between groups for other anthropometric, dietary, physical activity, or psychological measurements (including assessment of harm).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe primary analyses suggest that this experiential focused intervention had no statistically significant effect on BMI z score or on preventing childhood obesity.\n\n Schools are unlikely to impact on the childhood obesity epidemic by incorporating such interventions without wider support across multiple sectors and environments.\n\n\nTrial registration\nCurrent Controlled Trials

complex reasons, including poverty, historic trauma, rural isolation or urban loss of community connections, lack of access to healthy foods and physical activity opportunities, and high stress.\n\n Home-based obesity prevention interventions are lacking for these families.\n\n\nObjective\nHealthy Children, Strong Families 2 (HCSF2) was a randomized controlled trial of a healthy lifestyle promotion/obesity prevention intervention for AI families.\n\n\nMethods\nFour hundred and fifty dyads consisting of an adult primary caregiver and a child ages 2 to 5 y from 5 AI communities were randomly assigned to a monthly mailed healthy lifestyle intervention toolkit (Wellness Journey) with social support or to a child safety control toolkit (Safety Journey) for 1 y.\n\n The Wellness

behaviors, there has not been a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted to examine the effects of school garden programs on obesity or other health outcomes.\n\n The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of a one-year school-based gardening, nutrition, and cooking intervention (called Texas Sprouts) on dietary intake, obesity outcomes, and blood pressure in elementary school children.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>This study was a school-based cluster RCT with 16 elementary schools that were randomly assigned to either the Texas Sprouts intervention (n?=?8 schools) or to control (delayed intervention, n?=?8 schools).\n\n The intervention was one school year long (9?months) and consisted of: a) Garden Leadership Committee formation; b) a 0.25-acre outdoor teaching garden; c) 18 student gardening, nutrition, and cooking lessons taught by trained educators throughout the school-year; and d) nine monthly parent lessons.\n\n The delayed intervention was implemented the following academic year and received the same protocol as the intervention arm.\n\n Child outcomes measured were anthropometrics (i.\n\ne.\n\n, BMI parameters, waist circumference, and body fat percentage via bioelectrical impedance), blood pressure, and dietary intake (i.\n\ne.\n\n, vegetable, fruit, and sugar sweetened beverages) via survey.\n\n Data were analyzed with complete cases and with imputations at random.\n\n Generalized weighted linear mixed models were used to test the intervention effects and to account for clustering effect of sampling by school.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>A total of 3135 children were enrolled in the study (intervention n?=?1412, 45%).\n\n Average age was 9.2?years, 64% Hispanic, 47% male, and 69% eligible for free and

culturally bound Hispanic lifestyle behaviors.\n\n Peer health mentors have been used in schools to promote healthy nutrition and physical activity behaviors among students.\n\n This study investigates the efficacy of combining these 2 approaches by training high school health mentors, called compañeros, to engage Hispanic middle school students in a school-based obesity intervention as a strategy to promote and sustain reductions in standardized body mass index (zBMI).\n\n\nMethods\nHigh school compañeros were trained to participate in a 6-month obesity program alongside middle school students in Houston, Texas.\n\n Middle school students were randomized to participate in the program either with compañeros (n = 94) or without compañeros (n = 95).\n\n The intervention was conducted from 2013 through 2016 in 3 cohorts of students, 1 each school year.\n\n Students were followed for 12 months.\n\n The primary outcome was zBMI, which was analyzed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.\n\n\nResults\nSignificant differences were found between conditions across time (F = 4.58, P = .\n\n01).\n\n After the 6-month intervention, students in the condition with compañeros had a larger decrease in zBMI (F = 6.94, P = .\n\n01) than students in the condition without compañeros.\n\n Furthermore, students who received the intervention with compañeros showed greater sustained

intakes included macro- and micro-nutrients; and were suggestive of inadequacies in iron, folate, and calcium; and excessive sodium intakes.\n Dietary patterns were bicultural, including both Westernised and African dietary practices.\n Findings on physical activity behaviours were conflicting.\n Dietary and physical activity behaviours were influenced by post-migration environments,

programs.\n This study examined obesogenic behaviors in children with obesity in a Northern California obesity intervention program using data from a parent/teen-completed intake questionnaire covering dietary and lifestyle behaviors (frequency of breakfast, family meals, unhealthy snacking and beverages, fruit/vegetable intake, sleep, screen time, and exercise).\n Among 7956 children with BMI ? 95th percentile, 45.5% were females and 14.2% were 3–5, 44.2% were 6–11, and 41.6% were 12–17 years old.\n One-quarter (24.9%) were non-Hispanic white, 11.3% were black, 43.5% were Hispanic, and 12.0% were Asian/Pacific Islander.\n Severe obesity was prevalent (37.4%), especially among blacks, Hispanics, and older children, and was associated with less frequent breakfast and exercise and excess screen time, and in young children it was associated with consumption of sweetened beverages or juice.\n Unhealthy dietary behaviors, screen time, limited exercise, and sleep were more prevalent in older children and in selected black, Hispanic, and Asian subgroups, where consumption of sweetened beverages or juice was especially high.\n Overall, obesity severity and obesogenic behaviors increased with age and varied by gender and race/ethnicity.\n We identified several key prevalent modifiable behaviors that can be targeted by healthcare professionals to reduce obesity when counseling children with obesity and their parents.\n","id":"PMC4738748","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Margaret

experiencing a fast-paced epidemiological rise in clusters of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, forming an imminent rise in multimorbidity.\n However, preventing multimorbidity has received little attention in LMICs, especially in Sub-Saharan African Countries.\n Methods: Narrative review which scoped the most recent evidence in LMICs about multimorbidity determinants and appropriated them for potential multimorbidity prevention strategies.\n Results: MMD in LMICs is affected by several determinants including increased age, female sex, environment, lower socio-economic status, obesity, and lifestyle behaviours, especially poor nutrition, and physical inactivity.\n Multimorbidity public health interventions in LMICs, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa are currently impeded by local and regional economic disparity, underdeveloped healthcare systems, and concurrent prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases.\n However, lifestyle interventions that are targeted towards preventing highly prevalent multimorbidity clusters, especially hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, can provide early prevention of multimorbidity, especially within Sub-Saharan African countries with emerging economies and socio-economic disparity.\n Conclusion: Future public health initiatives should consider targeted lifestyle interventions and appropriate policies and guidelines in preventing multimorbidity in LMICs.\n","id":"PMC8656800","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ahmad","surname":"Alkhatib","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lawrence

Mortality?","abstract":"Background\nLittle is known about the effect of physical exercise on influenza-associated mortality.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nWe collected information about exercise habits and other lifestyles, and socioeconomic and demographic status, the underlying cause of death of 24,656 adults (21% aged 30–64, 79% aged 65 or above) who died in 1998 in Hong Kong, and the weekly proportion of specimens positive for influenza A (H3N1 and H1N1) and B isolations during the same period.\n\n We assessed the excess risks (ER) of influenza-associated mortality due to all-natural causes, cardiovascular diseases, or respiratory disease among different levels of exercise: never/seldom (less than once per month), low/moderate (once per month to three times per week), and frequent (four times or more per week) by Poisson regression.\n\n We also assessed the differences in ER between exercise groups by case-only logistic regression.\n\n For all the mortality outcomes under study in relation to each 10% increase in weekly proportion of specimens positive for influenza A+B, never/seldom exercise (as reference) was associated with 5.8% to 8.5% excess risks (ER) of mortality (P&lt;0.0001), while low/moderate exercise was associated with ER which were 4.2% to 6.4% lower than those of the reference (P&lt;0.001 for all-natural causes; P?=?0.001 for cardiovascular; and

first, holistic immunological model of COVID?19: Implications for prevention, diagnosis, and public health measures","abstract":"The natural history of COVID?19 caused by SARS?CoV?2 is extremely variable, ranging from asymptomatic or mild infection, mainly in children, to multi?organ failure, eventually fatal, mainly in the eldest.\n We propose here the first model explaining how the outcome of first, crucial 10?15 days after infection, depends on the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, mannose?binding lectin).\n If SARS?CoV?2 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens.\n The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high?affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm), leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal.\n Low?moderate physical activity can still be recommended.\n However, extreme physical activity and oral breathing with hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID?19 facilitates re?inhalation and early direct penetration of high numbers of own virus particles in the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airway’s mucosae covered by neutralizing antibodies ('viral auto?inhalation' phenomenon).\n This allows the virus to bypass the efficient immune barrier of the upper airway mucosa in already infected, young, and otherwise healthy athletes.\n In conclusion, whether the virus or the adaptive immune response reaches the lungs first is a crucial factor deciding the fate of the patient.\n This “quantitative and time?/sequence?dependent” model has several implications for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID?19 at all ages.\n","id":"PMC7267459","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paolo

that BMI alone cannot define obesity, which consists not so much in weight gain as in excess fat mass.\n The use of suitable tools for the assessment of fat mass percentage combined with clinical and

Various hypotheses have been proposed, all involving opportunities for virus spread (for example, agricultural practices, climate changes, rainforest clearing or air travel).\n However, the nutritional status of the host, until recently, has not been considered a contributing factor to the emergence of infectious disease.\n In this review, we show that host nutritional status can influence not only the host response to the pathogen, but can also influence the genetic make-up of the viral genome.\n This latter finding markedly changes our concept of host–pathogen interactions and creates a new paradigm for the study of such phenomena.\n","id":"PMC7127785","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Melinda A.","surname":"Beck","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jean","surname":"Handy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Orville A.","surname":"Levander","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41430-020-0635-2","date":"2020-04-01","title":"Nutritional recommendations for CoVID-19 quarantine","abstract":"","id":"PMC7155155","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Giovanna","surname":"Muscogiuri","email":"giovanna.muscogiuri@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luigi","surname":"Barrea","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Silvia","surname":"Savastano","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Silvia","surname":"Savastano","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Annamaria","surname":"Colao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Post-prandial effects of hazelnut-enriched high fat meal on LDL oxidative status, oxidative and inflammatory gene expression of healthy subjects: a randomized trial","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ministero della Sanita Classificazione statistica internazionale delle malattie e dei problemi sanitari correlati DECIMA REVISIONE. http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_pubblicazioni_1929_allegato.pdf.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.3390/nu12061865","date":"2020-06-20","title":"The Impact of Isolation Measures Due to COVID-19 on Energy Intake and Physical Activity Levels in Australian University Students","abstract":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in physical isolation measures in many parts of the world.\n In Australia, nationwide restrictions included staying at home, unless seeking medical care, providing care, purchasing food, undertaking exercise, or attending work in an essential service.\n All undergraduate university classes transitioned to online, mostly home-based learning.\n We, therefore, examined the effect of isolation measures during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (March/April) on diet (24-h recall) and physical activity (Active Australia Survey) patterns in third-year biomedical students.\n Findings were compared with students enrolled in the same course in the previous two years.\n In females, but not males, energy intake was ~20% greater during the pandemic, and snacking frequency and energy density of consumed snacks also increased compared with 2018 and 2019. Physical activity was impacted for both sexes during the pandemic with ~30% fewer students achieving “sufficient” levels of activity, defined by at least 150 min over at least five sessions, compared with the previous two years.\n In a follow-up study six to eight weeks later (14–18% response rate), during gradual easing of nationwide restrictions albeit continued gym closures and online learning, higher energy intake in females and reduced physical activity levels in both sexes persisted.\n These data demonstrate the health impacts of isolation measures, with the potential to affect long-term

status","abstract":"id='Par1'>An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention.\n On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern.\n The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century.\n As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO.\n Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to ?-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host.\n The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract.\n Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe.\n The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms.\n The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm.\n Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.\n In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.\n","id":"PMC7068984","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan-Rong","surname":"Guo","email":"guoyr5@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qing-Dong","surname":"Cao","email":"Cqd8866@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong-Si","surname":"Hong","email":"hongzhs@mail.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yang","surname":"Tan","email":"tanyy29@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shou-Deng","surname":"Chen","email":"chenshd5@mail.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong-Jun","surname":"Jin","email":"jinhj3@mail.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kai-Sen","surname":"Tan","email":"enttks@nus.edu.sg","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"De-Yun","surname":"Wang","email":"entwdy@nus.edu.sg","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Yan","email":"yanyan35@mail.sysu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMc2004973","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Aerosol

epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

has been validated and recommended as an efficient method to assess physical activity, but its validity has not been investigated in different population subgroups.\n\n We examined variations in IPAQ validity in the Hong Kong Chinese population by six factors: sex, age, job status, educational level, body mass index (BMI), and visceral fat level (VFL).\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 1,270 adults (aged 42.9 ± SD 14.4 years, 46.1% male) completed the Chinese version of IPAQ (IPAQ-C) and wore an accelerometer (ActiGraph) for four days afterwards.\n\n The IPAQ-C and the ActiGraph were compared in terms of estimated Metabolic Equivalent Task minutes per week (MET-min/wk), minutes spent in activity of moderate or vigorous intensity (MVPA), and agreement in the classification of physical

IPAQ-C, yet none of the subgroups showed good validity (? = 0.06 to 0.24).\n\n IPAQ-SF validity is questionable in our Chinese

activity.\n However, intrinsic motivators were also emphasised as more important in adherence to green exercise.\n Furthermore, as seen in other research, numerous psychological benefits were reported over time.\n The results of the study may act as a starting point in understanding how we may increase public engagement in green exercise by prompting participants to select a form of green exercise that best suits them based on their motivational profile.\n","id":"PMC6571838","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Fraser","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sarah-Anne","surname":"Munoz","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sarah-Anne","surname":"Munoz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sandra","surname":"MacRury","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/ijerph16050686","date":"2019-02-22","title":"Accelerometer-Measured

seven consecutive days and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was identified using the Evenson (2008) cut-points.\n Participant MVPA was 62.3 min/day, with 65.5 min/day during weekdays and 54.1 min/day on weekends.\n Indigenous Tibetans were more active than Hans, and boys had more MVPA than girls.\n Age had a significantly weak negative correlation with MVPA.\n There was no significant difference in MVPA between the non-overweight and overweight/obese groups.\n Overall, only 9.1% (13.8% in boys and 4.5% in girls) accumulated at least 60 min of MVPA per day.\n Compared to their counterparts in

viewing a television or computer screen during leisure time) is an important contributor to total sedentary behaviour, which is associated with increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\n The aim of this study was to determine whether the associations of screen time with cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality were modified by levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, grip strength or physical activity.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>In total, 390,089 participants (54% women) from the UK Biobank were included in this study.\n\n All-cause mortality, CVD and cancer incidence and mortality were the main outcomes.\n\n Discretionary television (TV) viewing, personal computer (PC) screen time and overall screen time (TV?+?PC time) were the exposure variables.\n\n Grip strength, fitness and physical activity were treated as potential effect modifiers.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Altogether, 7420 participants died, and there were 22,210 CVD events, over a median of 5.0 years follow-up (interquartile range 4.3 to 5.7; after exclusion of the first 2 years from baseline in the landmark analysis).\n\n All discretionary screen-time exposures were significantly associated with all health outcomes.\n\n The associations of overall discretionary screen time with all-cause mortality and incidence of CVD and cancer were strongest amongst participants in the lowest tertile for grip strength (all-cause mortality hazard ratio per 2-h increase in screen time (1.31 [95% confidence interval: 1.22–1.43], p?&lt;?0.0001; CVD 1.21 [1.13–1.30], p?=?0.0001; cancer incidence 1.14

anxiety symptoms and anger in persons isolated during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic both at isolation period and at four to six months after release from isolation.\n\n We also determined risk factors associated with these symptoms at four to six months.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOf 14,992 individuals isolated for 2-week due to having contact with MERS patients in 2015, when MERS was introduced to Korea, 1,692 individuals were included in this study.\n\n Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and anger was assessed with the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory at four to six months after release from isolation for MERS.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 1,692 who came in contact with MERS patients, 1,656 were not diagnosed with MERS.\n\n Among 1,656, anxiety symptoms showed 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3 to 8.9%) and feelings of anger were present in 16.6% (95% CI, 14.8 to 18.4%) during the isolation period.\n\n At four to six months after release from isolation, anxiety symptoms were observed in 3.0% (95%CI, 2.2 to 3.9%).\n\n Feelings of anger were present in 6.4% (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.6%).\n\n Risk factors for experiencing anxiety symptoms and anger at four to six months after release included symptoms related to MERS during isolation, inadequate supplies (food, clothes, accommodation), social networking activities (email, text, Internet), history of psychiatric illnesses, and financial loss.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMental health problems at four to six month after release from isolation might be prevented by providing mental health support to individuals with vulnerable mental health, and providing accurate information as well as appropriate supplies, including food, clothes, and

pattern of spread of an outbreak of a respiratory infectious disease and provide a theoretical basis for targeted implementation of scientific prevention and control, we attempted to establish a stochastic model to simulate an outbreak of a respiratory infectious disease at a military camp.\n\n This model fits the general pattern of disease transmission and further enriches theories on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We established an enclosed system of 500 people exposed to adenovirus type 7 (ADV 7) in a military camp.\n\n During the infection period, the patients transmitted the virus randomly to susceptible people.\n\n The spread of the epidemic under militarized management mode was simulated using a computer model named “the random collision model”, and the effects of factors such as the basic reproductive number (R0), time of isolation of the patients (TOI), interval between onset and isolation (IOI), and immunization rates (IR) on the developmental trend of the epidemic were quantitatively analysed.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Once the R0 exceeded 1.5, the median attack rate increased sharply; when R0?=?3, with a delay in the TOI, the attack rate increased gradually and eventually remained stable.\n\n When the IOI exceeded 2.3?days, the median attack rate also increased dramatically.\n\n When the IR exceeded 0.5, the median attack rate approached zero.\n\n The median generation time was 8.26?days, (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.84–8.69?days).\n\n The partial rank correlation coefficients between the attack rate of the epidemic and R0, TOI, IOI, and IR were 0.61, 0.17, 0.45, and???0.27, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>The random collision model not only simulates how an epidemic spreads with superior precision but also allows greater flexibility in setting the activities of the exposure population and different types of infectious diseases, which is conducive to furthering exploration of the epidemiological characteristics of epidemic

overweight and obese, and can also occur in significant numbers of normal-weight non-obese individuals.\n Being overfat increases the risk for a wide spectrum of common cardiovascular and metabolic (cardiometabolic) abnormalities, chronic diseases and physical impairment.\n In some ethnicities, up to 40% or more of those who are normal-weight and non-obese may be overfat, a figure twice that

prevalence being low when considering ethnicities such as Asians, Chinese, Africans and Latin Americans, including these individuals living among predominantly White populations.\n An awareness of the extent of the overfat pandemic is important because excess body fat can precede cardiometabolic risk factors, chronic diseases, and physical disabilities, and can reduce quality of life and increase

Overdue","abstract":"For the first time in human history, the number of obese people worldwide now exceeds those who are underweight.\n However, it is possible that there is an even more serious problem—an overfat pandemic comprised of people who exhibit metabolic health impairments associated with excess fat mass relative to lean body mass.\n Many overfat individuals, however, are not necessarily classified clinically as overweight or obese, despite the common use of body mass index as the clinical classifier of obesity and overweight.\n The well-documented obesity epidemic may merely be the tip of the overfat iceberg.\n The counterpart to the overfat condition is the underfat state, also a common and dangerous health circumstance associated with chronic illness and starvation.\n Currently (and paradoxically), high rates of obesity and overweight development coexist with undernutrition in developing countries.\n Studies in cognitive linguistics suggest that accurate, useful, and unintimidating terminology regarding abnormal body fat conditions could help increase a person’s awareness of their situation, helping the process of implementing prevention and simple remedies.\n Our contention is that promoting the terms “overfat” and “underfat” to describe body composition states to the point where they enter into common usage may help in creating substantive improvements in world health.\n","id":"PMC5206235","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Philip

influenza pandemic is poorly defined for seasonal influenza and other viral causes of influenza?like illness (ILI).\n\n\nMethods\nAn observational cohort of hospitalized and outpatient participants with ILI was conducted in six hospitals in Mexico.\n\n Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza and other common respiratory pathogens.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 4778 participants were enrolled in this study and had complete data.\n\n A total of 2053 (43.0%) had severe ILI.\n\n Seven hundred and seventy?eight (16.3%) were positive for influenza, 2636 (55.2%) were positive for other viral respiratory pathogens, and 1364 (28.5%) had no respiratory virus isolated.\n\n Adults with influenza were more likely to be hospitalized if they were underweight (OR: 5.20), obese (OR: 3.18), or morbidly obese (OR: 18.40) compared to normal?weight adults.\n\n Obese adults with H1N1 had a sixfold increase in odds of hospitalization over H3N2 and B (obese OR: 8.96 vs 1.35, morbidly obese OR: 35.13 vs 5.58, respectively) compared to normal?weight adults.\n\n In adults with coronavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, and rhinovirus, participants that were underweight (OR: 4.07) and

of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Medical Research

normal-weight and non-obese, often due to excess abdominal fat.\n Despite previous indications that the prevalence overweight and obesity is leveling, these conditions are currently at their highest levels in US history.\n Our review estimated the number of overfat Americans at 91% for adults and 69% for children.\n The primary purpose of this review was to build upon previous estimations of overfat prevalence in developed countries by using new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate the overfat prevalence in American adults (?20?years) and children (2–19?years), and to expand the definition of overfat as excess body fat associated with at least one additional risk factor of impaired cardiometabolic or physical health.\n The secondary goals are to highlight the role of dietary sugar as a primary cause of the overfat pandemic and mention new data showing the increased prevalence of exercise that parallels the rising prevalence of overfat to further emphasize the secondary role exercise may play in fat loss.\n Current public health guidelines to address the overfat pandemic may require more emphasis on reducing the consumption of refined carbohydrates, including added sugars.\n","id":"PMC5671970","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Philip

The objective was to investigate (i) the effects of adipokines (adiponectin (APN), leptin, chemerin, and visfatin) on the production of cytokines by unstimulated and poly(I:C)- and TNF-?-activated human primary bronchial epithelial cells (hBECs), (ii) the cells’ expression of the APN receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2), and (iii) the cells' production of APN.\n\n\nMethods\nThe hBECs were isolated from patients undergoing surgery for lung carcinoma.\n\n The cells were then cultured with human recombinant adipokines in the absence or presence of TNF-? or poly(I:C) for 24 h.\n\n Supernatant levels of cytokines (IL-6, CCL2, CCL5, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL8) and APN were measured using ELISAs.\n\n The mRNA levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in hBECs were determined using a real-time quantitative PCR.\n\n\nResults\nOf the four adipokines tested, only APN significantly influenced the basal production and the TNF-? poly(I:C)-induced production of cytokines by hBECs.\n\n APN (3-30 µg.\n\nml-1) was associated with greater basal production of IL-6, CCL20, and CXCL8, lower basal production of CCL2 and CXCL1 and no difference in CCL5 production.\n\n APN inhibited the poly(I:C)-induced production of these five cytokines and the TNF-?-induced production of CCL2 and CXCL1. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 were both expressed in hBECs.\n\n In contrast to human bronchial explants, isolated hBECs did not produce APN.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe APN concentrations are abnormally low in obese individuals, and this fall may contribute to the susceptibility to viral lung infections and the severity of these infections in obese individuals.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7040162","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hélène","surname":"Salvator","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stanislas","surname":"Grassin-Delyle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emmanuel","surname":"Naline","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marion","surname":"Brollo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caroline","surname":"Fournier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Louis-Jean","surname":"Couderc","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Devillier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/cid/civ060","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Adiposity and influenza-associated respiratory mortality: a cohort study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3389/fphys.2018.00982","date":"2018-07-03","title":"Adiponectin and Orexin-A as a Potential Immunity Link Between Adipose Tissue and Central Nervous System","abstract":"Adipose tissue (AT) is strongly associated with development and progression of immune disorders through adipokines secretion, such as adiponectin.\n This protein has beneficial energetic properties and is involved in inflammation and immunity processes.\n Three oligomers of circulating adiponectin with different molecular weight are described: High (HMW), Medium (MMW), and Low (LMW).\n The HMW is the most biologically active oligomers.\n On binding to its receptors AdipoR1, AdipoR2, and T-cadherin, adiponectin acts on both innate and acquired immunity.\n The suppression of NF-?B activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages is mediated by AdipoR1. AdipoR2 mediates polarization of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages T-cadherin is essential for the M2 macrophage proliferation.\n Furthermore, adiponectin reduces T cells responsiveness and B cells lymphopoiesis.\n The immune system is very sensitive to environmental changes and it is not only interconnected with AT but also with the central nervous system (CNS).\n Cytokines, which are mediators of the immune system, exercise control over mediators of the CNS.\n Microglia, which are immunity cells belonging to the macrophage family, are present within the CNS.\n The nervous system is also involved in immunity through the production of neuropeptides such as orexin-A/hypocretin-1.

groups corresponding to each of the last four of the six COVID-19 lockdown weeks in Greece","abstract":"There is a worldwide interest in how lockdown affects physical activity (PA) during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Although it has been shown that the mandated stay-at-home restrictions and self-isolation measures applied in different countries were accosiated with a reduction in physical exercise and activity, such results derive from studying only specific periods of lockdown.\n However, in order for this hypothesis to be tested, consecutive lockdown periods need to be examined separately.\n In this study we focus on PA change in Greek adults over time, during each of the last four weeks of lockdown in Greece.\n The web-based Active-Q questionnaire (see Supplementary file 1_Active-Q) was used to collect data prior to the COVID-19 crisis (PRE condition) and during lockdown measures (POST condition).\n The period of data collection (5 April to 3 May 2020) was divided into four phases (Ph-I, Ph-II, Ph-III, Ph-V), corresponding to the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th lockdown week respectively (out of a six-week total lockdown).\n There were four independent groups of respondents (G-I, G-II, G-III, G-V) who reported their age, weight, height and usual PA habits.\n Energy expenditure (EE) was calculated (MET-min/week; see Supplementary file 2_Data) in four main different domains (daily occupation activities, means of transportation to and from daily occupation, leisure time and regular sporting activities; see Supplementary file 3_Corresponding MET values).\n Each group's dataset corresponded to one of the aforementioned phases (G-I to Ph-I, G-II to Ph-II, and so on).\n Overall PA change (from PRE to POST condition) ranged from -21.50% in G-I (Ph-I) to -5.03 in G-V (Ph-V); PA change in male subgroups ranged from -26.10% in Ph-I to -13.64 in Ph-V; in female subgroups it ranged from -17.42% in Ph-I to -1.39 in Ph-V.\n Although the decline in overall PA is evident in all groups during each lockdown phase (p&lt;0.05), the combination of our data demonstrates that towards the end of lockdown this decline showed a gradual decreasing tendency.\n","id":"PMC7483084","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_elsevier_Core_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dimitrios

activity.\n\n Several studies validating the IPAQ-SF have been conducted with differing results, but no systematic review of these studies has been reported.\n\n\nMethods\nThe keywords 'IPAQ', 'validation', and 'validity' were searched in PubMed and Scopus.\n\n Studies published in English that validated the IPAQ-SF against an objective physical activity measuring device, doubly labeled water, or an objective fitness measure were included.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-three validation studies were included in this review.\n\n There was a great deal of variability in the methods used across studies, but the results were largely similar.\n\n Correlations between the total physical activity level measured by the IPAQ-SF and objective standards ranged from 0.09 to 0.39; none reached the minimal acceptable standard in the literature (0.50 for objective activity measuring devices, 0.40 for fitness measures).\n\n Correlations between sections of the IPAQ-SF for vigorous activity or moderate activity level/walking and an objective standard showed even greater variability (-0.18 to 0.76), yet several reached the minimal acceptable standard.\n\n Only six studies provided comparisons between physical activity levels derived from the IPAQ-SF and those obtained from objective criterion.\n\n In most studies the IPAQ-SF overestimated physical activity level by 36 to 173 percent; one study underestimated by 28 percent.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe correlation between the IPAQ-SF and objective measures of activity or fitness in the large majority of studies was lower than the acceptable standard.\n\n Furthermore, the IPAQ-SF typically overestimated physical activity as measured by objective criterion by an average of 84 percent.\n\n Hence, the evidence to support the use of the IPAQ-SF as an indicator of relative or absolute physical activity is weak.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3214824","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paul

which assesses physical activity (PA) in 4 domains (leisure, work, commuting, home) during past month.\n\n\nMethods\n580 men and 1343 women from 10 European countries attended 2 visits at which PA energy expenditure (PAEE), time at moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and sedentary time were measured using individually-calibrated combined heart-rate and movement sensing.\n\n At the second visit, RPAQ was administered electronically.\n\n Validity was assessed using agreement analysis.\n\n\nResults\nRPAQ significantly underestimated PAEE in women [median(IQR) 34.1 (22.1, 52.2) vs.\n\n 40.6 (32.4, 50.9) kJ/kg/day, 95%LoA: ?44.4, 63.4 kJ/kg/day) and in men (43.7 (29.0, 69.0) vs.\n\n 45.5 (34.1, 57.6) kJ/kg/day, 95%LoA: ?47.2, 101.3 kJ/kg/day].\n\n Using individualised definition of 1MET, RPAQ significantly underestimated MVPA in women [median(IQR): 62.1 (29.4, 124.3) vs.\n\n 73.6 (47.8, 107.2) min/day, 95%LoA: ?130.5, 305.3 min/day] and men [82.7 (38.8, 185.6) vs.\n\n 83.3 (55.1, 125.0)

relevance","abstract":"Studying gene-environment interactions requires that the amount and quality of the lifestyle data is comparable to what is available for the corresponding genomic data.\n Sweden has several crucial prerequisites for comprehensive longitudinal biomedical research, such as the personal identity number, the universally available national health care system, continuously updated population and health registries and a scientifically motivated population.\n LifeGene builds on these strengths to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical applications with particular attention to populations, through a unique design in a research-friendly setting.\n LifeGene is designed both as a prospective cohort study and an infrastructure with repeated contacts of study participants approximately every 5 years.\n Index persons aged 18–45 years old will be recruited and invited to include their household members (partner and any children).\n A comprehensive questionnaire addressing cutting-edge research questions will be administered through the web with short follow-ups annually.\n Biosamples and physical measurements will also be collected at baseline, and re-administered every 5 years thereafter.\n Event-based sampling will be a key feature of LifeGene.\n The household-based design will give the opportunity to involve young couples prior to and during pregnancy, allowing for the first study of children born into cohort with complete pre-and perinatal data from both the mother and father.\n Questions and sampling schemes will be tailored to the participants’ age and life events.\n The target of LifeGene is to enrol 500,000 Swedes and follow them longitudinally for at least 20 years.\n","id":"PMC7087900","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Catarina","surname":"Almqvist","email":"catarina.almqvist@ki.se","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hans-Olov","surname":"Adami","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul
