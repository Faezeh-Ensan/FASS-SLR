to improve oxygenation for patients with COVID-19 in retrospective and observational studies, but whether it improves patient-centred outcomes is unknown.\n\n We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of awake prone positioning to prevent intubation or death in patients with severe COVID-19 in a large-scale randomised trial.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this prospective, a priori set up and defined, collaborative meta-trial of six randomised controlled open-label superiority trials, adults who required respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula for acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 were randomly assigned to awake prone positioning or standard care.\n\n Hospitals from six countries were involved: Canada, France, Ireland, Mexico, USA, Spain.\n\n Patients or their care providers were not masked to allocated treatment.\n\n The primary composite outcome was treatment failure, defined as the proportion of patients intubated or dying within 28 days of enrolment.\n\n The six trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04325906, NCT04347941, NCT04358939, NCT04395144, NCT04391140, and NCT04477655.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween April 2, 2020 and Jan 26, 2021, 1126 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to awake prone positioning (n=567) or standard care (n=559).\n\n 1121 patients (excluding five who withdrew from the study) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.\n\n Treatment failure occurred in 223 (40%) of 564 patients assigned to awake prone positioning and in 257 (46%) of 557 patients assigned to standard care (relative risk 0·86 [95% CI 0·75?0·98]).\n\n The hazard ratio (HR) for intubation was 0·75 (0·62?0·91), and the HR for mortality was 0·87 (0·68?1·11) with awake prone positioning compared with standard care within 28 days of enrolment.\n\n The incidence of prespecified adverse events was low and similar in both groups.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAwake prone positioning of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 reduces the incidence of treatment failure and the need for intubation without any signal of harm.\n\n These results support routine awake prone positioning of patients with COVID-19 who require support with high-flow nasal cannula.\n\n\nFunding\nOpen AI inc, Rice Foundation, Projet Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique Interrégional, Appel d'Offre 2020, Groupement Interrégional de

history, trajectory, and management of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients in the United Kingdom","abstract":"Purpose\nid='Par1'>The trajectory of mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for clinical decisions, yet the focus so far has been on admission characteristics without consideration of the dynamic course of the disease in the context of applied therapeutic interventions.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We included adult patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission with complete clinical data until ICU death or discharge.\n\n We examined the importance of factors associated with disease progression over the first week, implementation and responsiveness to interventions used in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ICU outcome.\n\n We used machine learning (ML) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to characterise the evolution of clinical parameters and our ICU data visualisation tool is available as a web-based widget (https://www.\n\nCovidUK.\n\nICU).\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Data for 633 adults with COVID-19 who underwent IMV between 01 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 were analysed.\n\n Overall mortality was 43.3% and highest with non-resolution of hypoxaemia [60.4% vs17.6%; P?&lt;?0.001; median PaO2/FiO2 on the day of death was 12.3(8.9–18.4) kPa] and non-response to proning (69.5% vs.\n\n31.1%; P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Two ML models using weeklong data demonstrated an increased predictive accuracy for mortality compared to admission data (74.5% and 76.3% vs 60%, respectively).\n\n XAI models highlighted the increasing importance, over the first week, of PaO2/FiO2 in predicting mortality.\n\n Prone positioning improved oxygenation only in 45% of patients.\n\n A higher peak pressure (OR 1.42[1.06–1.91]; P?&lt;?0.05), raised respiratory component (OR 1.71[ 1.17–2.5]; P?&lt;?0.01) and cardiovascular component (OR 1.36 [1.04–1.75]; P?&lt;?0.05) of the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and raised lactate (OR 1.33 [0.99–1.79]; P?=?0.057) immediately prior to application of prone positioning were associated with lack of oxygenation response.\n\n Prone positioning was not applied to 76% of patients with moderate hypoxemia and 45% of those with severe hypoxemia and patients who died without receiving proning interventions had more missed opportunities for prone intervention [7 (3–15.5) versus 2 (0–6); P?&lt;?0.001].\n\n Despite the severity of gas exchange deficit, most patients received lung-protective ventilation with tidal volumes less than 8 mL/kg and plateau pressures less than 30cmH2O.\n\n This was despite systematic errors in measurement of height and derived ideal body weight.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Refractory hypoxaemia remains a major association with mortality, yet evidence based ARDS interventions, in particular prone positioning, were not implemented and had delayed application with an associated reduced responsiveness.\n\n Real-time service evaluation techniques offer opportunities to assess the delivery of care and improve protocolised implementation of evidence-based ARDS interventions, which might be associated with improvements in survival.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material

standard components of a protective lung ventilation strategy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n Open lung strategies, including higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment manoeuvres to date have not proven efficacious.\n\n This study examines the effectiveness and safety of a novel open lung strategy, which includes permissive hypercapnia, staircase recruitment manoeuvres (SRM) and low airway pressure with PEEP titration.\n\n\nMethod\nTwenty ARDS patients were randomised to treatment or ARDSnet control ventilation strategies.\n\n The treatment group received SRM with decremental PEEP titration and targeted plateau pressure &lt; 30 cm H2O.\n\n Gas exchange and lung compliance were measured daily for 7 days and plasma cytokines in the first 24 hours and on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 (mean ± SE).\n\n Duration of ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay (median and interquartile range) and hospital survival were determined.\n\n\nResults\nThere were significant overall differences between groups when considering plasma IL-8 and TNF-?.\n\n For plasma IL-8, the control group was 41% higher than the treatment group over the seven-day period (ratio 1.41 (1.11 to 1.79), P = 0.01), while for TNF-? the control group was 20% higher over the seven-day period (ratio 1.20 (1.01 to 1.42) P = 0.05).\n\n PaO2/FIO2 (204 ± 9 versus 165 ± 9 mmHg, P = 0.005) and static lung compliance (49.1 ± 2.9 versus 33.7 ± 2.7 mls/cm H2O, P &lt; 0.001) were higher in the treatment group than the control group over seven days.\n\n There was no difference in duration of ventilation (180 (87 to 298) versus 341 (131 to 351) hrs, P = 0.13), duration of ICU stay (9.9 (5.6 to 14.8) versus 16.0 (8.1 to 19.3) days, P = 0.19) and duration of hospital stay (17.9 (13.7 to 34.5) versus 24.7 (20.5 to 39.8) days, P = 0.16) between the treatment and control groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis open lung strategy was associated with greater amelioration in some systemic cytokines, improved oxygenation and lung compliance over seven days.\n\n A larger trial powered to examine clinically-meaningful outcomes is warranted.\n\n\nTrial

despite maximal ventilatory support.\n Conventional ventilation in this scenario leads to preferential distribution of tidal volume to the non-diseased lung causing over distension and inadvertent volume trauma.\n Since each lung has a different compliance and respiratory mechanics, instituting separate ventilation strategies to each lung could potentially minimize lung injury.\n Based on

compared settings typically used to evaluate B?lines at our institution with adjusted settings based on recent studies.\n\n\nMethods\nIn order to determine typical settings for B?line assessment, we retrospectively reviewed LUS images obtained at our institution.\n\n We then prospectively performed LUS with both typical and adjusted settings, using curvilinear and phased array probes, in 20 patients presenting to the emergency department with shortness of breath.\n\n The prospectively obtained clips were rated for quality and quantity of B?lines by 14 clinicians with experience in LUS,

Computed Tomography of the Chest Using 3D Transfer Learning","abstract":"Background\nIdentification of lung parenchyma on computer tomographic (CT) scans in the research setting is done semi-automatically and requires cumbersome manual correction.\n\n This is especially true in pathological conditions, hindering the clinical application of aeration compartment (AC) analysis.\n\n Deep learning based algorithms have lately been shown to be reliable and time-efficient in segmenting pathologic lungs.\n\n In this contribution, we thus propose a novel 3D transfer learning based approach to quantify lung volumes, aeration compartments and lung recruitability.\n\n\nMethods\nTwo convolutional neural networks developed for biomedical image segmentation (uNet), with different resolutions and fields of view, were implemented using Matlab.\n\n Training and evaluation was done on 180 scans of 18 pigs in experimental ARDS (u2NetPig) and on a clinical data set of 150 scans from 58 ICU patients with lung conditions varying from healthy, to COPD, to ARDS and COVID-19 (u2NetHuman).\n\n One manual segmentations (MS) was available for each scan, being a consensus by two experts.\n\n Transfer learning was then applied to train u2NetPig on the clinical data set generating u2NetTransfer.\n\n General segmentation quality was quantified using the Jaccard index (JI) and the Boundary Function score (BF).\n\n The slope between JI or BF and relative volume of non-aerated compartment (SJI and SBF, respectively) was calculated over data sets to assess robustness toward non-aerated lung regions.\n\n Additionally, the relative volume of ACs and lung volumes (LV) were compared between automatic and MS.\n\n\nResults\nOn the experimental data set, u2NetPig resulted in JI = 0.892 [0.88 : 091] (median [inter-quartile range]), BF = 0.995 [0.98 : 1.0] and slopes SJI = ?0.2 {95% conf.\n\n int.\n\n ?0.23 : ?0.16} and SBF = ?0.1 {?0.5 : ?0.06}.\n\n u2NetHuman showed similar performance compared to u2NetPig in JI, BF but with reduced robustness SJI = ?0.29 {?0.36 : ?0.22} and SBF = ?0.43 {?0.54 : ?0.31}.\n\n Transfer learning improved overall JI = 0.92 [0.88 : 0.94], P &lt; 0.001, but reduced robustness SJI = ?0.46 {?0.52 : ?0.40}, and affected neither BF = 0.96 [0.91 : 0.98] nor SBF = ?0.48 {?0.59 : ?0.36}.\n\n u2NetTransfer improved JI compared to u2NetHuman in segmenting healthy (P = 0.008), ARDS (P &lt; 0.001) and COPD (P = 0.004) patients but not in COVID-19 patients (P = 0.298).\n\n ACs and LV determined using u2NetTransfer segmentations exhibited &lt; 5% volume difference compared to MS.\n\n\nConclusion\nCompared to manual segmentations, automatic uNet based 3D lung segmentation provides acceptable quality for both clinical and scientific purposes in the quantification of lung volumes, aeration compartments, and
