progression of COVID?19 have attracted much attention from all over the world.\n\n We designed this study to develop a prognostic nomogram incorporating Prognostic nutritional index (PNI) in COVID?19 patients.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients confirmed with COVID?19 and treated in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January to February 2020 were included in this study.\n\n We used logistic regression analysis to find risk factors of mortality in these patients.\n\n A prognostic nomogram was constructed and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of PNI and this prognostic model.\n\n\nResults\nComparison of baseline characteristics showed non?survivors had higher age (P &lt; .\n\n001), male ratio (P = .\n\n038), neutrophil?to?lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (P &lt; .\n\n001), platelet?to?lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (P &lt; .\n\n001), and PNI (P &lt; .\n\n001) than survivors.\n\n In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent risk factors of mortality in COVID?19 patients included white blood cell (WBC) (OR 1.285, P = .\n\n039), PNI (OR 0.790, P = .\n\n029), LDH (OR 1.011, P &lt; .\n\n015).\n\n These three factors were combined to build the prognostic model.\n\n Area under the ROC curve (AUC) of only PNI and the prognostic model was 0.849 (95%Cl 0.811?0.888) and 0.950 (95%Cl 0.922?0.978), respectively.\n\n And calibration plot showed good stability of the prognostic model.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis research indicates PNI is independently associated with the mortality of COVID?19 patients.\n\n Prognostic model incorporating PNI is beneficial for clinicians to evaluate progression and strengthen monitoring for COVID?19 patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7595894","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ruoran","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

global pandemic.\n\n Data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes.\n\n\nMethods\nA retrospective review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted.\n\n Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on initial clinical presentation.\n\n Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments.\n\n Logistic regression models were performed to identify risk factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression.\n\n\nResults\nCurrent standard treatments did not show significant improvement in patient outcomes.\n\n By univariate logistic regression analysis, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes.\n\n Multivariate regression indicated age over 65 years (p&lt;0.001), smoking (p=0.001), critical disease status (p=0.002), diabetes (p=0.025), high hypersensitive troponin I (&gt;0.04 pg/mL, p=0.02), leukocytosis (&gt;10 x 109/L, p&lt;0.001) and neutrophilia (&gt;75 x 109/L, p&lt;0.001) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes.\n\n By contrast, the administration of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes (p&lt;0.001), which was confirmed by survival analysis.\n\n\nConclusions\nHypnotics may be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes.\n\n Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to

disease.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected in respiratory samples but also in blood, stool and urine.\n\n Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a dysregulated host response to this virus.\n\n We studied whether viral RNAemia or viral RNA load in plasma is associated with severe COVID-19 and also to this dysregulated response.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>A total of 250 patients with COVID-19 were recruited (50 outpatients, 100 hospitalized ward patients and 100 critically ill).\n\n Viral RNA detection and quantification in plasma was performed using droplet digital PCR, targeting the N1 and N2 regions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein gene.\n\n The association between SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma with severity was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression.\n\n Correlations between viral RNA load and biomarkers evidencing dysregulation of host response were evaluated by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficients.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The frequency of viral RNAemia was higher in the critically ill patients (78%) compared to ward patients (27%) and outpatients (2%) (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Critical patients had higher viral RNA loads in plasma than non-critically ill patients, with non-survivors showing the highest values.\n\n When outpatients and ward patients were compared, viral RNAemia did not show significant associations in the multivariate analysis.\n\n In contrast, when ward patients were compared with ICU patients, both viral RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma were associated with critical illness (OR [CI 95%], p): RNAemia (3.92 [1.183–12.968], 0.025), viral RNA load (N1) (1.962 [1.244–3.096], 0.004); viral RNA load (N2) (2.229 [1.382–3.595], 0.001).\n\n Viral RNA load in plasma correlated with higher levels of chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2), biomarkers indicative of a systemic inflammatory response (IL-6, CRP, ferritin), activation of NK cells (IL-15), endothelial dysfunction (VCAM-1, angiopoietin-2, ICAM-1), coagulation activation (D-Dimer and INR), tissue damage (LDH, GPT), neutrophil response (neutrophils counts, myeloperoxidase, GM-CSF) and immunodepression (PD-L1, IL-10, lymphopenia and monocytopenia).\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma are associated with critical illness in COVID-19. Viral RNA load in plasma correlates with key signatures of dysregulated host responses, suggesting a major role of uncontrolled viral replication in the pathogenesis of this

progress to shock and multiple organ failure.\n\n We explored whether continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) using a modified membrane (oXiris) capable of adsorption could reduce endotoxin and cytokine levels in septic patients.\n\n\nMethods\nSixteen patients requiring CRRT for septic shock-associated acute renal failure and who had endotoxin levels &gt;0.03 EU/ml were prospectively randomized in a crossover double-blind design to receive CRRT with an oXiris filter or with a standard filter.\n\n Endotoxin and cytokine levels were measured at baseline and 1, 3, 8, 16 and 24 hours after the start of CRRT.\n\n Norepinephrine infusion rate and blood lactate levels were monitored.\n\n\nResults\nDuring the first filter treatment period, endotoxin levels decreased in 7 of 9 (77.8%) oXiris filter patients, but in only 1 of 6 (16.7%) standard filter patients (P = 0.02).\n\n Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and interferon (IFN)? decreased more with the oXiris filter than with the standard filter.\n\n Lactate concentration decreased with oXiris (-1.3[-2.2 to -1.1] mmol/l, P = 0.02), but not with the standard filter (+0.15[-0.95 to 0.6]).\n\n The norepinephrine infusion rate was reduced during oXiris CRRT, but not during standard filter CRRT.\n\n In the second filter treatment period, there was no significant reduction in endotoxin or cytokine

hematology.\n Nevertheless, pharmacology progress comes with a variety of side effects, of which cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potential complication of some immunotherapies that can lead to multiorgan failure if not diagnosed and treated accordingly.\n CRS generally occurs with therapies that lead to highly activated T cells, like chimeric antigen receptor T cells or in the case of bispecific T-cell engaging antibodies.\n This, in turn, leads to a proinflammatory state with subsequent organ damage.\n To better manage CRS there is a need for specific therapies or to repurpose strategies that are already known to be useful in similar situations.\n Current management strategies for CRS are represented by anticytokine directed therapies and corticosteroids.\n Based on its pathophysiology and the resemblance of CRS to sepsis and septic shock, as well as based on the principles of initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in sepsis, we propose the rationale of using CRRT therapy as an adjunct treatment in CRS where all the other approaches have failed in controlling the clinically significant

in COVID-19 disease","abstract":"COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, accompanies an unprecedented spike in cytokines levels termed cytokines release syndrome (CRS), in critically ill patients.\n Clinicians claim that the surge demonstrates a deregulated immune defence in host, as infected cell expression analysis depicts a delay in type-I (interferon-I) and type-III IFNs expression, along with a limited Interferon-Stimulated Gene (ISG) response, which later resume and culminates in elicitation of several cytokines including- IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF?, IL-17, MCP-1, IP-10 and IL-10 etc.\n Although cytokines are messenger molecules of the immune system, but their increased concentration results in inflammation, infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and lung injury in patients.\n This inflammatory response results in the precarious pathogenesis of COVID-19; thus, a complete estimation of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is vital in designing a harmless and effective vaccine.\n In pathogenesis analysis, it emerges that a timely forceful type-I IFN production (18–24 hrs post infection) promotes innate and acquired immune responses, while a delay in IFNs production (3–4 days post infection) actually renders both innate and acquired responses ineffective in fighting infection.\n Further, underlying conditions including hypertension, obesity, cardio-vascular disease etc may increase the chances of putting people in risk groups, which end up having critical form of infection.\n This review summarizes the events starting from viral entry, its struggle with the immune system and failure of host immunological parameters to obliterate the infections, which finally culminate into massive release of CRS and inflammation in gravely ill patients.\n","id":"PMC7691139","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ritu","surname":"Pasrija","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohammad","surname":"Naime","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.burns.2005.02.004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Removal

with stage II (HR: 0.40, 95%CI: 0.28–1.66, P=0.397).\n\n When the subgroup of patients with ‘high-risk' LMR?2.83 was analysed, no benefit of adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy could be found (HR: 0.99; 95%CI: 0.60–1.63; P=0.953).\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe LMR might be an independent prognostic marker for TTR in stage III colon cancer patients.\n\n Our results further suggest that high-risk patients based on the LMR do not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n Independent validation of our findings is warranted.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3899781","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"M","surname":"Stotz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M","surname":"Pichler","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"G","surname":"Absenger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J","surname":"Szkandera","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"F","surname":"Arminger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R","surname":"Schaberl-Moser","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"H","surname":"Samonigg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T","surname":"Stojakovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A","surname":"Gerger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s40880-015-0063-1","date":"2015-11-18","title":"Prognostic

surrogate marker of systemic inflammation, the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) is an independent prognostic factor for various malignancies.\n\n This study investigated the prognostic significance of the pre-chemotherapy LMR in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) receiving chemotherapy.\n\n\nMethods\nThe present study included newly diagnosed mCRC patients treated between January 2005 and December 2013 with FOLFOX chemotherapy, specifically oxaliplatin 180 mg/m2 on day 1, with leucovorin 400 mg/m2 administered as a 2-hour infusion before the administration of 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 as an intravenous bolus injection, and 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 as a 46-h infusion immediately after 5-fluorouracil bolus injection.\n\n The LMR was calculated as the absolute count of lymphocytes divided by the absolute count of monocytes.\n\n COX proportional hazards analysis was performed to evaluate the association of LMR with survival outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 488 patients were included.\n\n Patients with high pre-chemotherapy LMR experienced significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS, 9.2 vs.\n\n 7.6 months, P &lt; 0.001) and overall survival (OS, 19.4 vs.\n\n 16.6 months, P &lt; 0.001) compared with patients with low pre-chemotherapy LMR.\n\n Subsequent COX multivariate analysis showed that high pre-chemotherapy LMR (?3.11) was an independent favorable prognostic factor for PFS and OS.\n\n Additionally, patients whose LMR remained high (high–high subgroup), increased (low–high subgroup), or decreased (high–low subgroup) following chemotherapy showed better results in terms of PFS and OS than patients whose LMR remained low (low–low subgroup) after chemotherapy.\n\n\nConclusions\nFor patients with previously untreated mCRC receiving FOLFOX chemotherapy, an elevated pre-chemotherapy LMR is an independent favorable prognostic factor for PFS and OS, and changes in the LMR before and after chemotherapy seem to predict the benefit of chemotherapy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4704261","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gui-Nan","surname":"Lin","email":"lgn83@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pan-Pan","surname":"Liu","email":"liupp@sysucc.org.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dong-Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"dongying332254@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jie-Wen","surname":"Peng","email":"pengjiewen@csco.org.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jian-Jun","surname":"Xiao","email":"xjj2215@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhong-Jun","surname":"Xia","email":"xiazhj1@163.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.pan.2014.12.004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

and confirmed in many types of cancers.\n\n However, few studies are available indicating its prognostic power in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).\n\n Thus, we investigated its relationship with overall survival (OS) to evaluate its role in predicting survival in patients with ICC.\n\n\nPatients and methods\nBetween October 2011 and October 2015, 173 consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic ICC were enrolled.\n\n First, the correlations between PNI and clinical factors were analyzed among these patients.\n\n Next, univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between PNI and OS among these patients with ICC.\n\n In addition, the relationships between PNI and three typical systemic inflammatory response (SIR) markers – the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and the lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR) – were also assessed.\n\n\nResults\nA lower PNI was linked with a shorter OS in patients with ICC, as reflected obviously in the Kaplan–Meier analyses.\n\n The patients with ICC were divided into the locally advanced group and the metastatic group.\n\n Further analyses revealed that PNI is not associated with OS in the locally advanced group.\n\n However, in the subgroup of patients with metastatic ICC, a lower PNI significantly correlated with a worsened OS.\n\n The OS for patients with a low PNI is 5 months, whereas the OS is 10.17 months for patients with a high PNI.\n\n Multivariate analyses revealed that PNI is independently correlated with OS.\n\n We finally proved that PNI is negatively proportional to NLR and PLR and positively proportional to LMR.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur results demonstrate that decreased PNI signifies a poor OS and is associated with SIR in patients with metastatic ICC.\n\n Therefore, it may serve as a valuable predictive marker in patients with metastatic ICC.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5077274","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chenyue","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haiyong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhouyu","surname":"Ning","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Litao","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liping","surname":"Zhuang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Meng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ejso.2015.07.022","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prognostic

Pulmonary Disease Based on the Service-Oriented Architecture Paradigm and Business Process Management Strategy: Development and Usability Survey Among Patients and Health Care Providers","abstract":"Background\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory disease with a high global prevalence.\n\n The main scientific societies dedicated to the management of this disease have published clinical practice guidelines for quality practice.\n\n However, at present, there are important weaknesses in COPD diagnosis criteria that often lead to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis.\n\n\nObjective\nWe sought to develop a new support system for COPD diagnosis.\n\n The system was designed to overcome the weaknesses detected in current guidelines with the goals of enabling early diagnosis, and improving the diagnostic accuracy and quality of care provided.\n\n\nMethods\nWe first analyzed the main clinical guidelines for COPD to detect weaknesses that exist in the current diagnostic process, and then proposed a redesign based on a business process management (BPM) strategy for its optimization.\n\n The BPM system acts as a backbone throughout the process of COPD diagnosis in this proposed approach.\n\n The newly developed support system was integrated into a health information system for validation of its use in a hospital environment.\n\n The system was qualitatively evaluated by experts (n=12) and patients (n=36).\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 12 experts, 10 (83%) positively evaluated our system with respect to increasing the speed for making the diagnosis, helping in interpreting results, and encouraging opportunistic diagnosis.\n\n With an overall rating of 4.29 on a 5-point scale, 27/36 (75%) of patients considered that the system was very useful in providing a warning about possible cases of COPD.\n\n The overall assessment of the system was 4.53 on a 5-point Likert scale with agreement to extend its use to all primary care centers.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe proposed system provides a functional method to overcome the weaknesses detected in the current diagnostic process for COPD, which can help foster early diagnosis, while improving the diagnostic accuracy and quality of care provided.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7109614","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patricia","surname":"Sánchez

disease (COPD) could become epidemic.\n\n An up-to-date nationwide estimation of COPD prevalence in China is needed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of individuals from mainland China aged 40 years or older.\n\n The primary outcome was COPD, defined according to the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) lung function criteria.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Dec 29, 2014, and Dec 31, 2015, 66?752 adults were recruited to the study population.\n\n The estimated standardised prevalence of COPD was 13·6% (95% CI 12·0–15·2).\n\n The prevalence of COPD differed significantly between men and women (19·0%, 95% CI 16·9–21·2 vs 8·1%, 6·8–9·3; p&lt;0·0001), mainly because of a significant difference in smoking status between men and women (current smokers 58·2% vs 4·0%).\n\n The prevalence of COPD differed by geographic region, with the highest prevalence in southwest China (20·2%, 95% CI 14·7–25·8) and the lowest in central China (10·2%, 8·2–12·2).\n\n Among adults with COPD, 56·4% (95% CI 53·7–59·2) had mild disease (GOLD stage I), 36·3% (34·3–38·3) had moderate disease (GOLD stage II), 6·5% (5·5–7·4) had severe disease (GOLD stage III), and 0·9% (0·6–1·1) had very severe disease (GOLD stage IV).\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn a large, nationally representative sample of adults aged 40 years or older, the

There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities.\n\n\nObjective:\nTo estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications.\n\n\nDesign:\nPooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020.\nSetting:\nNews reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n\n\nParticipants:\nPersons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China.\n\n\nMeasurements:\nPatient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization.\n\n\nResults:\nThere were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

(SARSCoV).\n\n We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thijs","surname":"Kuiken","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ron

defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera

reverse-transcriptase PCR and serology.\n\n Pathological samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\n\n\nFindings\nAll six patients had serological evidence of recent infection with SARS-CoV.\n\n Diffuse alveolar damage was common but not universal.\n\n Morphological changes identified were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia.\n\n Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case.\n\n A giant-cell infiltrate was seen in four patients, with a pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung.\n\n Haemophagocytosis was present in two patients.\n\n The alveolar pneumocytes also showed cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm.\n\n The patient for whom full autopsy was done had atrophy of the white pulp of the spleen.\n\n Electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells corresponding to coronavirus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nSARS is associated with epithelial-cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages in the lung.\n\n The presence of haemophagocytosis supports the contention that cytokine dysregulation may account, at least partly, for the severity of the clinical disease.\n\n The case definition of SARS should acknowledge the range of lung pathology associated with this disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112492","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"John M","surname":"Nicholls","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Leo

genetics caused a reduction in the deleterious exacerbation of the immune response triggered during infection with the parental virus and virus attenuation.\n Cellular protein syntenin was identified to bind the E protein PBM during SARS-CoV infection by using three complementary strategies, yeast two-hybrid, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy assays.\n Syntenin redistributed from the nucleus to the cell cytoplasm during infection with viruses containing the E protein PBM, activating p38 MAPK and leading to the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines.\n Silencing of

alfa-2a (180 ?g per week for 2 weeks).\n\n The primary endpoint was 14-day and 28-day survival from the date of MERS-CoV infection diagnosis.\n\n We used ?2 and Fischer's exact test to analyse categorical variables and the t test to analyse continuous variables.\n\n\nFindings\nWe analysed 20 patients who received ribavirin and interferon (treatment group; initiated a median of 3 days [range 0–8] after diagnosis) and 24 who did not (comparator group).\n\n Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between groups, apart from baseline absolute neutrophil count, which was significantly lower in the comparator group (5·88?×?109/L [SD 3·95] vs 9·88?×?109/L [6·63]; p=0·023).\n\n 14 (70%) of 20 patients in the treatment group had survived after 14 days, compared with seven (29%) of 24 in the comparator group (p=0·004).\n\n After 28 days, six (30%) of 20 and four (17%) of 24, respectively, had survived (p=0·054).\n\n Adverse effects were similar between groups, apart from reduction in haemoglobin, which was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the comparator group (4·32 g/L [SD 2·47] vs 2·14 g/L [1·90]; p=0·002).\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy is associated with significantly improved survival at 14 days, but not at 28 days.\n\n Further assessment in appropriately designed randomised trials is recommended.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7106357","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ali

SARS coronavirus","abstract":"Background\nThe complex interplay between viral replication and host immune response during infection remains poorly understood.\n\n While many viruses are known to employ anti-immune strategies to facilitate their replication, highly pathogenic virus infections can also cause an excessive immune response that exacerbates, rather than reduces pathogenicity.\n\n To investigate this dichotomy in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we developed a transcriptional network model of SARS-CoV infection in mice and used the model to prioritize candidate regulatory targets for further investigation.\n\n\nResults\nWe validated our predictions in 18 different knockout (KO) mouse strains, showing that network topology provides significant predictive power to identify genes that are important for viral infection.\n\n We identified a novel player in the immune response to virus infection, Kepi, an inhibitory subunit of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, which protects against SARS-CoV pathogenesis.\n\n We also found that receptors for the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF?) promote pathogenesis, presumably through excessive inflammation.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe current study provides validation of network modeling approaches for identifying important players in virus infection pathogenesis, and a step forward in understanding the host response to an important infectious disease.\n\n The results presented here suggest the role of Kepi in the host response to SARS-CoV, as well as inflammatory activity driving pathogenesis through TNF? signaling in SARS-CoV infections.\n\n Though we have reported the utility of this approach in bacterial and cell culture studies previously, this is the first comprehensive study to confirm that network topology can be used to predict phenotypes in mice with experimental validation.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n\nFindings\n47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77%) were male (male:female ratio 3·3:1).\n\n 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate.\n\n The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age.\n\n Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45

at presentation were fever (46 [98%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87%]), cough (39 [83%]), shortness of breath (34 [72%]), and myalgia (15 [32%]).\n\n Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea (12 [26%]), vomiting (ten [21%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17%]).\n\n All patients had abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities.\n\n Laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven [15%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34%]).\n\n\nInterpretation\nDisease caused by MERS-CoV presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted

approved antiviral therapy.\n\n We aimed to compare ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a treatment for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection with a supportive therapy only.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (aged ?16 years) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection and pneumonia needing ventilation support, diagnosed between Oct 23, 2012, and May 1, 2014, at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia).\n\n All patients received appropriate supportive care and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring, but patients diagnosed after Sept 16, 2013, were also given oral ribavirin (dose based on calculated creatinine clearance, for 8–10 days) and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 ?g per week for 2 weeks).\n\n The primary endpoint was 14-day and 28-day survival from the date of MERS-CoV infection diagnosis.\n\n We used ?2 and Fischer's exact test to analyse categorical variables and the t test to analyse continuous variables.\n\n\nFindings\nWe analysed 20 patients who received ribavirin and interferon (treatment group; initiated a median of 3 days [range 0–8] after diagnosis) and 24 who did not (comparator group).\n\n Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between groups, apart from baseline absolute neutrophil count, which was significantly lower in the comparator group (5·88?×?109/L [SD 3·95] vs 9·88?×?109/L [6·63]; p=0·023).\n\n 14 (70%) of 20 patients in the treatment group had survived after 14 days, compared with seven (29%) of 24 in the comparator group (p=0·004).\n\n After 28 days, six (30%) of 20 and four (17%) of 24, respectively, had survived (p=0·054).\n\n Adverse effects were similar between groups, apart from reduction in haemoglobin, which was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the comparator group (4·32 g/L [SD 2·47] vs 2·14 g/L [1·90]; p=0·002).\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy is associated with significantly improved survival at 14 days, but not at 28 days.\n\n Further assessment in appropriately designed randomised trials is recommended.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7106357","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ali

This interaction is necessary for the antigen specific immune response.\n Furthermore, CD40L and sCD40L are involved in inflammation and a panoply of immune related and vascular pathologies.\n Soluble CD40L is primarily produced by platelets after activation, degranulation and cleavage, which may present a problem for transfusion.\n Soluble CD40L is involved in adverse transfusion events including transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI).\n Although platelet storage designed for transfusion occurs in sterile conditions, platelets are activated and release sCD40L without known agonists.\n Recently, proteomic studies identified signaling pathways activated in platelet concentrates.\n Soluble CD40L is a good candidate for platelet activation in an auto-amplification loop.\n In this review, we describe the immunomodulatory role of CD40L in physiological and pathological conditions.\n We will focus on the main signaling pathways activated by CD40L after binding to its different receptors.\n","id":"PMC4284712","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaker","surname":"Aoui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antoine","surname":"Prigent","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caroline","surname":"Sut","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sofiane","surname":"Tariket","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hind","surname":"Hamzeh-Cognasse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Pozzetto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yolande","surname":"Richard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fabrice","surname":"Cognasse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sandrine","surname":"Laradi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olivier","surname":"Garraud","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.04.018","date":"2007-04-24","title":"Effects of epidermal growth factor on atrophic enteritis in piglets induced by experimental porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","abstract":"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) promotes gastrointestinal mucosal recovery by stimulating the mitogenic activity of intestinal crypt epithelial cells.\n The aim of this study was to determine the effects of EGF on atrophic enteritis induced in piglets by experimental infection with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) strain Dr13.

MERS-CoV pathogenesis.\n We investigated the spatial and cellular localization of DPP4 to evaluate an association MERS clinical disease.\n DPP4 was rarely detected in the surface epithelium from nasal cavity to conducting airways with a slightly increased incidence in distal airways.\n DPP4 was also found in a subset of mononuclear leukocytes and in serous cells of submucosal glands.\n In the parenchyma, DPP4 was found principally in type I and II cells and alveolar macrophages and was also detected in vascular endothelium (eg, lymphatics) and pleural mesothelia.\n Patients with chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis, exhibited increased DPP4 immunostaining in alveolar epithelia (type I and II cells) and alveolar macrophages with similar trends in reactive mesothelia.\n This finding suggests that preexisting pulmonary disease could increase MERS-CoV receptor abundance and predispose individuals to MERS morbidity and mortality, which is consistent with current clinical observations.\n We speculate that the preferential spatial localization of DPP4 in alveolar regions may explain why MERS is characterized by lower respiratory

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843).\n\n The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade.\n\n Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs.\n\n However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor.\n\n\nConclusion\nA novel bat-borne CoV was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147275","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Li-Li","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ye-Ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Qiang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zi-Chun","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Teng","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhong","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Jun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Wang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guo-Hui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Ying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiu-Yang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin-Ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-Wei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao-Lin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Ping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhen-Shun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Lin","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Hui","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuan","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Wei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Yuan","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Yuan","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pei-Fang","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3","date":"2020-01-28","title":"A

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or

hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that senses environmental exogenous and endogenous ligands or xenobiotic chemicals.\n In particular, exposure of the liver to

shown superior performance for the prediction of chemical compounds.\n Therefore, this study proposes a novel QSAR analysis using deep learning (DL), called the DeepSnap–DL method, to construct prediction models of chemical activation of AhR.\n Compared with conventional machine learning (ML) techniques, such as the random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, the proposed method achieves

Delineating Liver Steatosis Adverse Outcome Pathways","abstract":"Exposure to chemicals contributes to the development and progression of fatty liver, or steatosis, a process characterized by abnormal accumulation of lipids within liver cells.\n However, lack of knowledge on how chemicals cause steatosis has prevented any large-scale assessment of the 80,000+ chemicals in current use.\n To address this gap, we mined a large, publicly available toxicogenomic dataset associated with 18 known steatogenic chemicals to assess responses across assays (in vitro and in vivo) and species (i.\ne.\n, rats and humans).\n We identified genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) in rat in vivo, rat in vitro, and human in vitro studies in which rats or in vitro primary cell lines were exposed to the chemicals at different doses and durations.\n Using these DEGs, we performed pathway enrichment analysis, analyzed the molecular initiating events (MIEs) of the steatosis adverse outcome pathway (AOP), and predicted metabolite changes using metabolic network analysis.\n Genes indicative of oxidative stress were among the DEGs most frequently observed in the rat in vivo studies.\n Nox4, a pro-fibrotic gene, was down-regulated across these chemical exposure conditions.\n We identified eight genes (Cyp1a1, Egr1, Ccnb1, Gdf15, Cdk1, Pdk4, Ccna2, and Ns5atp9) and one pathway (retinol metabolism), associated with steatogenic chemicals and whose response was conserved across the three in vitro and in vivo systems.\n Similarly, we found the predicted metabolite changes, such as increases of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, conserved across the three systems.\n Analysis of the target genes associated with the MIEs of the current steatosis AOP did not provide a clear association between these 18 chemicals and the MIEs, underlining the multi-factorial nature of this disease.\n Notably, our overall analysis implicated mitochondrial toxicity as an important and overlooked MIE for chemical-induced steatosis.\n The integrated toxicogenomics approach to identify genes, pathways, and metabolites based on known steatogenic chemicals, provide an important mean to assess development of AOPs and gauging the relevance of new testing strategies.\n","id":"PMC6813744","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mohamed Diwan

Chemicals: Changing the Narrative to Empower Action to Restore Metabolic Health","abstract":"Metabolic disease rates have increased dramatically over the last four decades.\n Classic understanding of metabolic physiology has attributed these global trends to decreased physical activity and caloric excess; however, these traditional risk factors insufficiently explain the magnitude and rapidity of metabolic health deterioration.\n Recently, the novel contribution of environmental metabolism-disrupting chemicals (MDCs) to various metabolic diseases (including obesity, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) is becoming recognized.\n As this burgeoning body of evidence has matured, various organic and inorganic pollutants of human and natural origin have emerged as metabolic disease risk factors based on population-level and experimental data.\n Recognition of these heretofore underappreciated metabolic stressors now mandates that efforts to mitigate the devastating consequences of metabolic disease include dedicated efforts to address environmental drivers of disease risk; however, there have not been adequate recommendations to reduce exposures or to mitigate the effects of exposures on disease outcomes.\n To address this knowledge gap and advance the clinical translation of MDC science, herein discussed are behaviors that increase exposures to MDCs, interventional studies to reduce those exposures, and small-scale clinical trials to reduce the body burden of MDCs.\n Also, we discuss evidence from cell-based and animal studies that provide insights into MDC mechanisms of action, the influence of modifiable dietary factors on MDC toxicity, and factors that modulate MDC transplacental carriage as well as their impact on metabolic homeostasis.\n A particular emphasis of this discussion is on critical developmental windows during which short-term MDC exposure can elicit long-term disruptions in metabolic health with potential inter- and transgenerational effects.\n While data gaps remain and further studies are needed, the current state of evidence regarding interventions to address MDC exposures illuminates approaches to address environmental drivers of metabolic disease risk.\n It is now incumbent on clinicians and public health agencies to incorporate this knowledge into comprehensive strategies to address the metabolic disease pandemic.\n","id":"PMC6369180","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert

in-house-developed approach to rationally select Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) training set substances from an unbalanced data set.\n In the first iteration, active and inactive substances were selected by random to make QSAR models.\n Then, more inactive substances were added to the training set in two further iterations based on incorrect or out-of-domain predictions to produce larger models.\n The resulting ‘rational’ model, comprising 832 actives and four times as many inactives, i.\ne.\n 3,328, was compared to a model with a training set of same size and proportion of inactives chosen entirely by random.\n Both models underwent robust cross-validation and external validation showing good statistical performance, with the rational model having external validation sensitivity of 85.1% and specificity of 97.1%, compared to the random model with sensitivity 89.1% and specificity 91.3%.\n Furthermore, we integrated the training sets for both models with the 93 external validation test set actives and 372 randomly selected inactives to make two final models.\n They also underwent external validations for specificity and cross-validations, which confirmed that good predictivity was maintained.\n All developed models were applied to predict 80,086 EU REACH substances.\n The rational and random final models had 63.1% and 56.9% coverage of the REACH set, respectively, and predicted 1,256 and 3,214 substances as actives.\n The final models as well as predictions for AhR activation for 650,000 substances will be published in the Danish (Q)SAR

orchestrate adaptive stress responses to maintain cell and tissue homeostasis.\n Chronic exposure of skin to these factors, however, may lead to the accumulation of damaged macromolecules and loss of cell and tissue integrity, which, over time, may facilitate aging processes and the development of aging-related malignancies.\n One transcription factor that is expressed in all cutaneous cells and activated by various environmental stressors, including dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and ultraviolet radiation, is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).\n By regulating keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, epidermal barrier function, melanogenesis, and immunity, a certain degree of AHR activity is critical to maintain skin integrity and to adapt to acute stress situations.\n In contrast, a chronic activation of cutaneous AHR signaling critically contributes to premature aging and the development of neoplasms by affecting metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation, pigmentation, DNA repair, and apoptosis.\n This article provides an overview of the detrimental effects associated with sustained AHR activity in chronically stressed skin

ligand-specific manner in order to carry out a myriad of functions in diverse cellular contexts.\n Much has been learned about the molecular mechanisms of ligand-GPCR complexes from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.\n However, to explore ligand-specific differences in the response of a GPCR to diverse ligands, as is required to understand ligand bias and functional selectivity, necessitates creating very large amounts of data from the needed large-scale simulations.\n This becomes a Big Data problem for the high dimensionality analysis of the accumulated trajectories.\n Here we describe a new machine learning (ML) approach to the problem that is based on transforming the analysis of GPCR function-related, ligand-specific differences encoded in the MD simulation trajectories into a

combating pathogens resistant to conventional antibiotics.\n\n Computer-assisted peptide discovery strategies are necessary to automatically assess a significant amount of data by generating models that efficiently classify what an antimicrobial peptide is, before its evaluation in the wet lab.\n\n Model’s performance depends on the selection of molecular descriptors for which an efficient and

learning models in QSAR problems.\n For the assessment of these methods, seven different molecular representations that included RDKit descriptors, five different fingerprints types (MACCS, PubChem, FP2-based, Atom Pair, and ECFP4), and a graph matching approach (non-contiguous atom matching structure similarity; NAMS) in both vector space and metric space, were subjected to state-of-art machine

The NAMS-based similarity approach consistently outperformed most fingerprint representations in model quality, closely followed by Atom Pair fingerprints.\n To further verify these findings, the metric space-based models were fitted to the same data sets with the closest neighbors removed.\n These latter results further strengthened the above conclusions.\n The metric space graph-based

distributed around the world and may affect the homeostasis of the endocrine system by disrupting the normal functions of hormone receptors.\n Although the risks associated with these compounds have been evaluated by acute toxicity testing in mammalian models, the chronic toxicity of many chemicals remains due to high cost of the compounds and the testing, etc.\n However, computational approaches may be promising alternatives and reduce these evaluations.\n Recently, deep learning (DL) has been shown to be promising prediction models with high accuracy for recognition of images, speech, signals, and videos since it greatly benefits from large datasets.\n Recently, a novel DL-based technique called DeepSnap was developed to conduct QSAR analysis using three-dimensional images of chemical structures.\n It can be used to predict the potential toxicity of many different chemicals to various receptors without extraction of descriptors.\n DeepSnap has been shown to have a very high capacity in tests using Tox21 quantitative qHTP datasets.\n Numerous parameters must be adjusted to use the DeepSnap method but they have not been optimized.\n In this study, the effects of these parameters on the performance of the DL prediction model were evaluated in terms of the loss in validation as an indicator for evaluating the performance of the DL using the toxicity information in the Tox21 qHTP database.\n The relations of the parameters of DeepSnap such as (1) number of molecules per SDF split into (2) zoom factor percentage, (3) atom size for van der waals percentage, (4) bond radius, (5) minimum bond distance, and (6) bond tolerance, with the validation loss following quadratic function curves, which suggests that optimal thresholds exist to attain the best performance with these prediction models.\n Using the parameter values set with the best performance, the prediction model of chemical compounds for CAR agonist was built using 64 images, at 105° angle, with AUC of 0.791. Thus, based on these parameters, the proposed DeepSnap-DL approach will be highly reliable and beneficial to establish models to assess the risk associated with various chemicals.\n","id":"PMC6447703","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yasunari","surname":"Matsuzaka","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yoshihiro","surname":"Uesawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/ijms20194855","date":"2019-09-27","title":"Prediction

increasing interest as novel treatment strategy.\n However, clinical trials using the PR modulators have not yet been found conclusive evidences.\n Recently, increasing evidence from several fields shows that the classification of chemical compounds, including agonists and antagonists, can be done with recent improvements in deep learning (DL) using deep neural network.\n Therefore, we recently proposed a novel DL-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) strategy using transfer learning to build prediction models for agonists and antagonists.\n By employing this novel

3D-structures.\n Furthermore, comparison of the prediction models from this approach with conventional machine learnings (MLs) indicated the DeepSnap-DL method outperformed these MLs.\n Therefore, the

principal component analysis (PCA) to pharmacophore hit molecules and further applied statistical machine learning methods.\n Optimal performance of pharmacophore modeling and machine learning

body underwater is very challenging with the absolute necessity to a diver or a submersible.\n For the vision sensor, the water turbidity and limited light condition make it difficult to take clear images.\n For this reason, sonar sensors are mainly utilized in water.\n However, even though a sonar sensor can give a plausible underwater image within this limitation, the sonar image’s quality varies greatly depending on the background of the target.\n The readability of the sonar image is very different according to the target distance from the underwater floor or the incidence angle of the sonar sensor to the floor.\n The target background must be very considerable because it causes scattered and polarization noise in the sonar image.\n To successfully classify the sonar image with these noises, we adopted a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) such as AlexNet and GoogleNet.\n In preparing the training data for this model, the data augmentation on scattering and polarization were implemented to improve the classification accuracy from the original sonar image.\n It could be practical to classify sonar images undersea even by training sonar images only from the simple testbed

implemented a computational model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from mosquito images to identify adult mosquitoes from the species Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus.\n To train the CNN to perform automatic morphological classification of mosquitoes, we used a dataset that included 4,056 mosquito images.\n Three neural networks, including LeNet, AlexNet and GoogleNet, were used.\n During the validation phase, the accuracy of the mosquito classification was 57.5% using LeNet, 74.7% using AlexNet and 83.9% using GoogleNet.\n During the testing phase, the best result (76.2%) was obtained using GoogleNet; results of 52.4% and 51.2% were obtained using LeNet and AlexNet, respectively.\n Significantly, accuracies of 100% and 90% were achieved for the classification of Aedes and Culex, respectively.\n A classification accuracy of 82% was achieved for Aedes females.\n Our results provide information that is fundamental for the automatic morphological classification of adult mosquito species in field.\n The use of CNN's is an important method for autonomous identification and is a valuable and accessible resource for health workers and taxonomists for the identification of some insects that can transmit infectious agents to humans.\n","id":"PMC6331110","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Motta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alex Álisson

ophthalmologists’ diagnostic evaluations of corneal photographs from patients who visited the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH) at Konkuk University and 3 different veterinary ophthalmology specialty hospitals in Korea.\n The original images (depicting normal corneas (36) and corneas with superficial (47) ulcers, deep (47) ulcers), flipped images (total 520), rotated images (total 520), and both flipped and rotated images (total 1,040) were labeled, learned and evaluated with GoogLeNet, ResNet, and VGGNet models, and the severity of each corneal ulcer image was determined.\n To accomplish this task, models based on TensorFlow, an open-source software library developed by Google, were used, and the labeled images were converted into TensorFlow record (TFRecord) format.\n The models were fine-tuned using a CNN model trained on the ImageNet dataset and then used to predict severity.\n Most of the models achieved accuracies of over 90% when classifying superficial and deep corneal ulcers, and ResNet and VGGNet achieved accuracies over 90% for classifying normal corneas, corneas with superficial ulcers, and corneas with deep ulcers.\n This study proposes a method to effectively determine corneal ulcer severity in dogs by using a CNN and concludes that multiple image classification models can be used in the veterinary

Diabetes among Chinese Adults: Results from a Retrospective Cohort Study","abstract":"Aims\n This article performed a retrospective cohort study to estimate the annual incidence rates of diabetes and to assess the utility of HbA1c as a predictor for progression to diabetes in Chinese community adults aged 40 years or older.\n\n \nMethods\n In all, 2778 nondiabetic subjects (including 1901 women) underwent HbA1c testing and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measurements at baseline and after 3 years.\n\n Diabetes and prediabetes were defined using the WHO criteria.\n\n The HbA1c cutoff points were evaluated to predict the future risks of diabetes.\n\n Relative risk (RR) was calculated using the chi-square test.\n\n The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the predictive efficiency of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2?hr postprandial plasma glucose (2hPG), and HbA1c for progression to diabetes.\n\n A superior cutoff point was defined as the point on the ROC curve with a larger Youden index.\n\n \nResults\n Overall, 7.5% (210/2778) of the subjects progressed to diabetes, yielding an annual 2.5% diabetes incidence rate.\n\n Additionally, 4.5% (100/2227) of the subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 19.6% (110/561) of the subjects with prediabetes progressed to diabetes, and the relative risk of progression to diabetes was 5.188 times higher in subjects with prediabetes than in subjects with NGT (p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Compared to subjects with HbA1c values???5.6%, the RRs of progression to diabetes in subjects whose HbA1c ranged from 5.7 to 5.8%, 5.9 to 6.2%, 6.3 to 6.4%, and ?6.5% were 1.165, 2.582, 5.732, and 16.619, respectively.\n\n However, the RRs for subjects with HbA1c ranging from 5.7 to 5.8% and those with HbA1c???5.6% did not differ significantly (p = 0.615).\n\n The AUCs for predicting diabetes after 3 years by FPG, 2hPG, and HbA1c were 0.752 (95% confidence interval 0.718–0.787), 0.710 (95% confidence interval 0.671–0.748), and 0.756 (95% confidence interval 0.720–0.793), respectively.\n\n The HbA1c cutoff point of 5.9% (sensitivity of 0.771 and specificity of 0.580) may better identify individuals at high risk of progression to diabetes than the 5.7% value (sensitivity of 0.862 and specificity of 0.371) due to the former's larger Youden index of 0.351, which exceeded the indices for FPG and 2hPG.\n\n \nConclusions\n The use of HbA1c values???5.9% may provide greater accuracy in evaluating the risk of progression to diabetes and identify individuals with prediabetes with greater reliability among Chinese adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6020536","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kai","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chuan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lingshu","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianyi","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiuping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chengqiao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weifang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zeqiang","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aixia","surname":"Ma","email":"max7194@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xinguo","surname":"Hou","email":"houxinguo@medmail.com.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xinguo","surname":"Hou","email":"houxinguo@medmail.com.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Chen","email":"chenli3@medmail.com.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Chen","email":"chenli3@medmail.com.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.04.039","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Application

gastric cancer (AGC) patients is highly possible to be missed on computed tomography (CT) images.\n\n Patients with occult PMs are subject to late detection or even improper surgical treatment.\n\n We therefore aimed to develop a radiomic nomogram to preoperatively identify occult PMs in AGC patients.\n\n\nPatients and methods\nA total of 554 AGC patients from 4 centers were divided into 1 training, 1 internal validation, and 2 external validation cohorts.\n\n All patients’ PM status was firstly diagnosed as negative by CT, but later confirmed by laparoscopy (PM-positive n?=?122, PM-negative n?=?432).\n\n Radiomic signatures reflecting phenotypes of the primary tumor (RS1) and peritoneum region (RS2) were built as predictors of PM from 266 quantitative image features.\n\n Individualized nomograms of PM status incorporating RS1, RS2, or clinical factors were developed and evaluated regarding prediction ability.\n\n\nResults\nRS1, RS2, and Lauren type were significant predictors of occult PM (all P?&lt;?0.05).\n\n A nomogram of these three factors demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy than the model with RS1, RS2, or clinical factors alone (all net reclassification improvement P?&lt;?0.05).\n\n The area under curve yielded was 0.958 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.923–0.993], 0.941 (95% CI 0.904–0.977), 0.928 (95% CI 0.886–0.971), and 0.920 (95% CI 0.862–0.978) for the training, internal, and two external validation cohorts, respectively.\n\n Stratification analysis showed that this nomogram had potential generalization ability.\n\n\nConclusion\nCT phenotypes of both primary tumor and nearby peritoneum are significantly associated with occult PM status.\n\n A nomogram of these CT phenotypes and Lauren type has an excellent prediction ability of occult PM, and may have significant clinical implications on early detection of occult PM for

Radiomic Data Extracted from Static and Respiratory-Gated CT Scans with Disease Recurrence in Lung Cancer Patients Treated with SBRT","abstract":"Radiomics aims to quantitatively capture the complex tumor phenotype contained in medical images to associate them with clinical outcomes.\n This study investigates the impact of different types of computed tomography (CT) images on the prognostic performance of radiomic features for disease recurrence in early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).\n 112 early stage NSCLC patients treated with SBRT that had static free breathing (FB) and average intensity projection (AIP) images were analyzed.\n Nineteen radiomic features were selected from each image type (FB or AIP) for analysis based on stability and variance.\n The selected FB and AIP radiomic feature sets had 6 common radiomic features between both image types and 13 unique features.\n The prognostic performances of the features for distant metastasis (DM) and locoregional recurrence (LRR) were evaluated using the concordance index (CI) and compared with two conventional features (tumor volume and maximum diameter).\n P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate procedure.\n None of the FB radiomic features were associated with DM, however, seven AIP radiomic features, that described tumor shape and heterogeneity, were (CI range: 0.638–0.676).\n Conventional features from FB images were not associated with DM, however, AIP conventional features were (CI range: 0.643–0.658).\n Radiomic and conventional multivariate models were compared between FB and AIP images using cross validation.\n The differences between the models were assessed using a permutation test.\n AIP radiomic multivariate models (median CI = 0.667) outperformed all other models (median CI range: 0.601–0.630) in predicting DM.\n None of the imaging features were prognostic of LRR.\n Therefore, image type impacts the performance of radiomic models in their association with disease recurrence.\n AIP images contained more information than FB images that were associated with disease recurrence in early stage NSCLC patients treated with SBRT, which suggests that AIP images may potentially be more optimal for the development of an imaging biomarker.\n","id":"PMC5207741","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Elizabeth","surname":"Huynh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thibaud

and rs-EPI.\n\n For qualitative comparison of image quality, three readers independently assessed the two sets of diffusion-weighted (DW) images.\n\n To evaluate geometric distortion, a comparison was made between lesion lengths derived from contrast enhanced MR (CE-MR) images and those obtained from the corresponding DW images.\n\n For assessment of image parameters, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), lesion contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated.\n\n\nResults\nThe rs-EPI was superior to ss-EPI in most criteria regarding the qualitative image quality.\n\n Anatomical structure distinction, delineation of the lesion, ghosting artifact, and overall image quality were significantly better in rs-EPI.\n\n Regarding the geometric distortion, lesion length on ss-EPI was significantly different from that of CE-MR, whereas there were no significant differences between CE-MR and rs-EPI.\n\n The rs-EPI was superior to ss-EPI in SNR and

cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January 10 to February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed.\n\n The data of laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection.\n\n The median age was 58 years and 235 were male.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia.\n\n Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.\n\n Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines.\n\n The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases.\n\n Both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, and lower level of helper T cells in severe group.\n\n The percentage of naïve helper T cells increased and memory helper T cells decreased in severe cases.\n\n Patients with COVID-19 also have lower level of regulatory T cells, and more obviously damaged in severe cases.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes.\n\n Surveillance of NLR and lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the early screening of critical illness, diagnosis and treatment of

(SARSCoV).\n\n We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thijs","surname":"Kuiken","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ron

limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes

to bind the E protein PBM during SARS-CoV infection by using three complementary strategies, yeast two-hybrid, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy assays.\n Syntenin redistributed

Development of countermeasures is ongoing; however, an animal model that faithfully recapitulates human disease has yet to be defined.\n A recent study indicated that inoculation of common marmosets

pathology, weight loss and viral titer.\n Genetic mapping revealed several loci contributing to differential disease responses, including an 8.5Mb locus associated with vascular cuffing on chromosome 3 that contained 23 genes and 13 noncoding RNAs.\n Integrating phenotypic and genetic data narrowed this region to a single gene, Trim55, an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a role in muscle fiber maintenance.\n Lung pathology and transcriptomic data from mice genetically deficient in Trim55 were used to validate its role in SARS-CoV-induced vascular cuffing and inflammation.\n These data

emerging virus involved in cases and case clusters of severe acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK.\n\n We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification.\n\n We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes.\n\n\nFindings\nA 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to

virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay).\n\n One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL).\n\n No virus was detected in blood.\n\n The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation.\n\n The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011.

SARS coronavirus","abstract":"Background\nThe complex interplay between viral replication and host immune response during infection remains poorly understood.\n\n While many viruses are known to employ anti-immune strategies to facilitate their replication, highly pathogenic virus infections can also cause an excessive immune response that exacerbates, rather than reduces pathogenicity.\n\n To investigate this dichotomy in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we developed a transcriptional network model of SARS-CoV infection in mice and used the model to prioritize candidate regulatory targets for further investigation.\n\n\nResults\nWe validated our predictions in 18 different knockout (KO) mouse strains, showing that network topology provides significant predictive power to identify genes that are important for viral infection.\n\n We identified a novel player in the immune response to virus infection, Kepi, an inhibitory subunit of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, which protects against SARS-CoV pathogenesis.\n\n We also found that receptors for the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF?) promote pathogenesis, presumably through excessive inflammation.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe current study provides validation of network modeling approaches for identifying important players in virus infection pathogenesis, and a step forward in understanding the host response to an important infectious disease.\n\n The results presented here suggest the role of Kepi in the host response to SARS-CoV, as well as inflammatory activity driving pathogenesis through TNF? signaling in SARS-CoV infections.\n\n Though we have reported the utility of this approach in bacterial and cell culture studies previously, this is the first comprehensive study to confirm that network topology can be used to predict phenotypes in mice with experimental validation.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this

a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had

aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and computed tomography (CT) features associated with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nEighty-three patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including 25 severe/critical cases and 58 ordinary cases were enrolled.\n\n The chest CT images and clinical data of them were reviewed and compared.\n\n The risk factors associated with disease severity were analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with the ordinary patients, the severe/critical patients had older ages, higher incidence of comorbidities, cough, expectoration, chest pain, and dyspnea.\n\n The incidences of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, and bronchial wall thickening in severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients.\n\n Besides, severe/critical patients showed higher incidences of lymph node enlargement, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion than the ordinary patients.\n\n The CT scores of severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients (P &lt; 0.001).\n\n Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the sensitivity and specificity of CT score were 80.0% and 82.8%, respectively, for the discrimination of the 2 types.\n\n The clinical factors of age older than 50 years, comorbidities, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, expectoration, decreased lymphocytes, and increased inflammation indicators were risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Computed tomography findings of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, bronchial wall thickening, high CT scores, and extrapulmonary lesions were features of severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\nConclusions\nThere are significant differences in clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, and CT manifestations between the ordinary patients and the severe/critical patients.\n\n Many factors are related to the severity of the disease, which can help clinicians to judge the severity of the patient and evaluate the

who present with a spectrum of complications is very difficult, hindering the prognostication and management of the disease.\n\n We aimed to develop an accurate prediction model of COVID-19 mortality using unbiased computational methods, and identify the clinical features most predictive of this outcome.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this prediction model development and validation study, we applied machine learning techniques to clinical data from a large cohort of patients with COVID-19 treated at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, NY, USA, to predict mortality.\n\n We analysed patient-level data captured in the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse database for individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who had a health system encounter between March 9 and April 6, 2020. For initial analyses, we used patient data from March 9 to April 5, and randomly assigned (80:20) the patients to the development dataset or test dataset 1 (retrospective).\n\n Patient data for those with encounters on April 6, 2020, were used in test dataset 2 (prospective).\n\n We designed prediction models based on clinical features and patient characteristics during health system encounters to predict mortality using the development dataset.\n\n We assessed the resultant models in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score in the test datasets.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing the development dataset (n=3841) and a systematic machine learning framework, we developed a COVID-19 mortality prediction model that showed high accuracy (AUC=0·91) when applied to test datasets of retrospective (n=961) and prospective (n=249) patients.\n\n This model was based on three clinical features: patient's age, minimum oxygen saturation over the course of their medical encounter, and type of patient encounter (inpatient vs outpatient and telehealth visits).\n\n\nInterpretation\nAn accurate and parsimonious COVID-19 mortality prediction model based on three features might have utility in clinical settings to guide the management and prognostication of patients affected by this disease.\n\n External validation of this prediction model in other populations is needed.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institutes of Health.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7508513","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Arjun

updated in 2012, and there continues to be substantial growth in the number of available CPMs.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We updated a systematic review of CPMs for CVD to include articles published from January 1990 to March 2015.

measures for the degree of clustering.\n\n We present a method to detect heavily clustered variables and to identify physicians with outlying measurements.\n\n\nMethods\nWe use regression models with fixed effects to account for patient case-mix and a random cluster intercept to study clustering by physicians.\n\n We propose to use the residual intraclass correlation (RICC), the proportion of residual variance that is situated at the cluster level, to detect variables that are influenced by clustering.\n\n An RICC of 0 indicates that the variance in the measurements is not due to variation between clusters.\n\n We further suggest, where appropriate, to evaluate RICC in combination with R2, the proportion of variance that is explained by the fixed effects.\n\n Variables with a high R2 may have benefits that outweigh the disadvantages of clustering in terms of statistical analysis.\n\n We apply the proposed methods to a dataset collected for the development of models for ovarian

While assessing discrimination is an essential issue in developing and validating binary prediction models, less attention has been paid to methods for assessing model calibration.\n Calibration refers to the degree of agreement between observed and predicted probabilities and is often assessed by testing for lack?of?fit.\n The objective of our study was to examine the ability of graphical methods to assess the calibration of logistic regression models.\n We examined lack of internal calibration, which was related to misspecification of the logistic regression model, and external calibration, which was related to an overfit model or to shrinkage of the linear predictor.\n We conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations with a locally weighted least squares regression smoother (i.\ne.\n, the loess algorithm) to examine the ability of graphical methods to assess model calibration.\n We found that loess?based methods were able to provide evidence of moderate departures from linearity and indicate omission of a moderately strong interaction.\n Misspecification of the link function was harder to detect.\n Visual patterns were clearer with higher sample sizes, higher incidence of the outcome, or higher discrimination.\n Loess?based methods were also able to identify the lack of calibration in external validation samples when an overfit regression model had been used.\n In conclusion, loess?based smoothing methods are adequate tools to graphically assess calibration and merit wider application.\n © 2013 The Authors.\n Statistics in Medicine

in terms of the number of participants (n) and outcome events (E) relative to the number of predictor parameters (p) considered for inclusion.\n We propose that the minimum values of n and E (and subsequently the minimum number of events per predictor parameter, EPP) should be calculated to meet the following three criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of ?0.9, (ii) small absolute difference of ? 0.05 in the model's apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke's R2, and (iii) precise estimation of the overall risk in the population.\n Criteria (i) and (ii) aim to reduce overfitting conditional on a chosen p, and require prespecification of the model's anticipated Cox?Snell R2, which we show can be obtained from previous studies.\n The values of n and E that meet all three criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development.\n Upon application of our approach, a new diagnostic model for Chagas disease requires an EPP of at least 4.8 and a new prognostic model for recurrent venous thromboembolism requires an EPP of at least 23. This reinforces why rules of thumb (eg, 10 EPP) should be avoided.\n Researchers might additionally ensure the sample size gives precise estimates of key predictor effects; this is especially important when key categorical predictors have few events in some categories, as this may substantially increase the numbers required.\n","id":"PMC6519266","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Richard D","surname":"Riley","email":"r.riley@keele.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kym IE","surname":"Snell","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Kym IE","surname":"Snell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joie","surname":"Ensor","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Danielle L","surname":"Burke","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Danielle L","surname":"Burke","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frank E","surname":"Harrell Jr","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Frank E","surname":"Harrell Jr","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Karel GM","surname":"Moons","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gary S","surname":"Collins","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.01.020","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Penalized maximum likelihood estimation to directly adjust diagnostic and prognostic prediction models for overoptimism: a clinical example","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Van Calster B, van Smeden M, Steyerberg EW.

artery disease (CAD), with the ultimate aim to better select patients for coronary angiography.\n\n\nDesign\nAnalysis of individual baseline data of a prospective cardiology cohort.\n\n\nSetting\nSingle-centre secondary and tertiary cardiology clinic.\n\n\nParticipants\n4888 patients with suspected CAD, without known previous CAD or other heart diseases, who underwent an elective coronary angiography between 2004 and 2008 as part of the prospective Coronary Artery disease Risk Determination In Innsbruck by diaGnostic ANgiography (CARDIIGAN) cohort.\n\n Relevant data were recorded as in routine clinical practice.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nThe probability of obstructive CAD, defined as a stenosis of minimally 50% diameter in at least one of the main coronary arteries, estimated with the predictors age, sex, type of chest pain, diabetes status, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking status and laboratory data.\n\n Missing predictor data were multiply imputed.\n\n Performance of the suggested models was evaluated according to discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, depicted by the c statistic) and calibration.\n\n Logistic regression modelling was applied for model updating.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 4888 participants (38% women and 62% men), 2127 (44%) had an obstructive CAD.\n\n The previously proposed model had a c statistic of 0.69 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.70), which was lower than the expected c statistic while correcting for case mix (c=0.80).\n\n Regarding calibration, there was overprediction of risk for high-risk patients.\n\n All logistic regression coefficients were smaller than expected, especially for the predictor ‘chest pain’.\n\n Extension of the model with high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fibrinogen, and C reactive protein led to better discrimination (c=0.72, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.74, p&lt;0.001 for improvement).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe proposed prediction model has a moderate performance to diagnose obstructive CAD in an unselected patient group with suspected CAD referred for elective CA.\n\n A small, but significant improvement was attained by including easily available and measurable cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5558815","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Edlinger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Wanitschek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jakob","surname":"Dörler","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hanno","surname":"Ulmer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hannes

in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

P681 emerging independently across different variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta).\n Such homoplasy is a marker of convergent evolution.\n Since Spring 2022 and the third year of the pandemic, with the advent of Omicron and its sublineages, convergent evolution has led to the observation of different lineages acquiring an additional group of mutations at different amino acid residues, namely R346, K444, N450, N460, F486, F490, Q493, and S494. Mutations at these residues have become increasingly prevalent during Summer and Autumn 2022, with combinations showing increased fitness.\n The most likely reason for this convergence is the selective pressure exerted by previous infection- or vaccine-elicited immunity.\n Such accelerated evolution has caused failure of all anti-Spike monoclonal antibodies, including bebtelovimab and cilgavimab.\n While we are learning how fast coronaviruses can mutate and recombine, we should reconsider opportunities for economically sustainable escape-proof combination therapies, and refocus antibody-mediated therapeutic efforts on polyclonal preparations that are less likely to allow for viral immune escape.\n","id":"PMC9917121","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniele","surname":"Focosi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rodrigo","surname":"Quiroga","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Rodrigo","surname":"Quiroga","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Scott","surname":"McConnell","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Scott","surname":"McConnell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marc C.","surname":"Johnson","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Marc C.","surname":"Johnson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Arturo","surname":"Casadevall","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Arturo","surname":"Casadevall","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jorge H.","surname":"Leitão","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Jorge H.","surname":"Leitão","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jorge H.","surname":"Leitão","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.2147/IJGM.S365207","date":"2022-09-07","title":"Clinico-Epidemiological Profile of COVID-19 Patients with Omicron Variant Admitted in a Tertiary Care Center, South India","abstract":"Background and Objectives\nOmicron, a variant of SARS COV2, is looming large as a cause of global concern.\n\n Its high transmissibility can pose challenges in healthcare allocation in a highly populous country like India.\n\n Studying the behaviour of the virus among the Indian population will definitely help in planning for the impending omicron surge, so we conducted a preliminary analysis of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the suspected omicron cases in the early part of the surge.\n\n\nMethodology\nThe study was conducted in the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, from 17th December 2021 to 11th January 2022.

assessment of the clinical severity of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in South Africa: a data linkage study","abstract":"Background\nThe SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant of concern was identified in South Africa in November, 2021, and was associated with an increase in COVID-19 cases.\n\n We aimed to assess the clinical severity of infections with the omicron variant using S gene target failure (SGTF) on the Thermo Fisher Scientific TaqPath COVID-19 PCR test as a proxy.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did data linkages for national, South African COVID-19 case data, SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test data, SARS-CoV-2 genome data, and COVID-19 hospital admissions data.\n\n For individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 via TaqPath PCR tests, infections were designated as either SGTF or non-SGTF.\n\n The delta variant was identified by genome sequencing.\n\n Using multivariable logistic regression models, we assessed disease severity and hospitalisations by comparing individuals with SGTF versus non-SGTF infections diagnosed between Oct 1 and Nov 30, 2021, and we further assessed disease severity by comparing SGTF-infected individuals diagnosed between Oct 1 and Nov 30, 2021, with delta variant-infected individuals diagnosed between April 1 and Nov 9, 2021.\nFindings\nFrom Oct 1 (week 39), 2021, to Dec 6 (week 49), 2021, 161?328 cases of COVID-19 were reported in South Africa.\n\n 38?282 people were diagnosed via TaqPath PCR tests and 29?721 SGTF infections and 1412 non-SGTF infections were identified.\n\n The proportion of SGTF infections increased from two (3·2%) of 63 in week 39 to 21?978 (97·9%) of 22?455 in week 48. After controlling for factors associated with hospitalisation, individuals with SGTF infections had significantly lower odds of admission than did those with non-SGTF infections (256 [2·4%] of 10?547 vs 121 [12·8%] of 948; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·2, 95% CI 0·1–0·3).\n\n After controlling for factors associated with disease severity, the odds of severe disease were similar between hospitalised individuals with SGTF versus non-SGTF infections (42 [21%] of 204 vs 45 [40%] of 113; aOR 0·7, 95% CI 0·3–1·4).\n\n Compared with individuals with earlier delta variant infections, SGTF-infected individuals had a significantly lower odds of severe disease (496 [62·5%] of 793 vs 57 [23·4%] of 244; aOR 0·3, 95% CI 0·2–0·5), after controlling for factors associated with disease severity.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur early analyses suggest a significantly reduced odds of hospitalisation among individuals with SGTF versus non-SGTF infections diagnosed during the same time period.\n\n SGTF-infected individuals had a significantly reduced odds of severe disease compared with individuals infected earlier with the delta variant.\n\n Some of this reduced severity is probably a result of previous immunity.\n\n\nFunding\nThe South African Medical Research Council, the South African National Department of Health, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the African Society of Laboratory Medicine, Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Bill &amp;

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

Learning Model","abstract":"Motivation\nProtein contacts contain key information for the understanding of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction from sequence is an important problem.\n\n Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not very useful for de novo structure prediction.\n\n\nMethod\nThis paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual neural networks.\n\n The first residual network conducts a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation of sequential features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional convolutional transformation of pairwise information including output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise potential.\n\n By using very deep residual networks, we can accurately model contact occurrence patterns and complex sequence-structure relationship and thus, obtain higher-quality contact prediction regardless of how many sequence homologs are available for proteins in question.\n\n\nResults\nOur method greatly outperforms existing methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted folding.\n\n Tested on 105 CASP11 targets, 76 past CAMEO hard targets, and 398 membrane proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained by our method, one representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively.\n\n Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints but without any force fields can yield correct folds (i.\n\ne.\n\n, TMscore&gt;0.6) for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively.\n\n Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models especially for membrane proteins.\n\n The 3D models built from our contact prediction have TMscore&gt;0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins, while those from homology modeling have TMscore&gt;0.5 for only 10 of them.\n\n Further, even if trained mostly by soluble proteins, our deep learning method works very well on membrane proteins.\n\n In the recent blind CAMEO benchmark, our fully-automated web server implementing this method successfully folded 6 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs, including one ? protein of 182 residues, one ?+? protein of 125 residues, one ? protein of 140 residues, one ? protein of 217 residues, one ?/? of 260 residues and one ? protein of 462 residues.\n\n Our method also achieved the highest F1 score on free-modeling targets in the latest CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction), although it was not fully implemented back then.\n\n\nAvailability\n\nhttp://raptorx.\n\nuchicago.\n\nedu/ContactMap/\n\n","id":"PMC5249242","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Siqi","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Renyu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jinbo","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Avner","surname":"Schlessinger","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Avner","surname":"Schlessinger","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Avner","surname":"Schlessinger","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1109/tcbb.2014.2343960","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data.\n However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge.\n There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning.\n Another effective method is transfer learning, i.\ne.\n, fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks.\n In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems.\n We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures.\n The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers.\n We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance.\n Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful.\n We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification.\n We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories.\n Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging

Comprehensive Benchmark of Kernel Methods to Extract Protein–Protein Interactions from Literature","abstract":"The most important way of conveying new findings in biomedical research is scientific publication.\n Extraction of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) reported in scientific publications is one of the core topics of text mining in the life sciences.\n Recently, a new class of such methods has been proposed - convolution kernels that identify PPIs using deep parses of sentences.\n However, comparing published results of different PPI extraction methods is impossible due to the use of different evaluation corpora, different evaluation metrics, different tuning procedures, etc.\n In this paper, we study whether the reported performance metrics are robust across different corpora and learning settings and whether the use of deep parsing actually leads to an increase in extraction quality.\n Our ultimate goal is to identify the one method that performs best in real-life scenarios, where information extraction is performed on unseen text and not on specifically prepared evaluation data.\n We performed a comprehensive benchmarking of nine different methods for PPI extraction that use convolution kernels on rich linguistic information.\n Methods were evaluated on five different public corpora using cross-validation, cross-learning, and cross-corpus evaluation.\n Our study confirms that kernels using dependency trees generally outperform kernels based on syntax trees.\n However, our study also shows that only the best kernel methods can compete with a simple rule-based approach when the evaluation prevents information leakage between training and test corpora.\n Our results further reveal that the F-score of many approaches drops significantly if no corpus-specific parameter optimization is applied and that methods reaching a good AUC score often perform much worse in terms of F-score.\n We conclude that for most kernels no sensible estimation of PPI extraction performance on new text is possible, given the current heterogeneity in evaluation data.\n Nevertheless, our study shows that three kernels are clearly superior to the other

research is becoming a reality.\n\n A critical part of that process is rigid benchmark testing of natural language processing methods on realistic clinical narrative.\n\n In this paper, the authors describe the design and performance of three state-of-the-art text-mining applications from the National Research Council of Canada on evaluations within the 2010 i2b2 challenge.\n\n\nDesign\nThe three systems perform three key steps in clinical information extraction: (1) extraction of medical problems, tests, and treatments, from discharge summaries and progress notes; (2) classification of assertions made on the medical problems; (3) classification of relations between medical concepts.\n\n Machine learning systems performed these tasks using large-dimensional bags of features, as derived from both the text itself and from external sources: UMLS, cTAKES, and Medline.\n\n\nMeasurements\nPerformance was measured per subtask, using micro-averaged F-scores, as calculated by comparing system annotations with ground-truth annotations on a test set.\n\n\nResults\nThe systems ranked high among all submitted systems in the competition, with the following F-scores: concept extraction 0.8523 (ranked first); assertion detection 0.9362 (ranked first); relationship detection 0.7313 (ranked second).\n\n\nConclusion\nFor all tasks, we found that the introduction of a wide range of features was crucial to success.\n\n Importantly, our choice of machine learning algorithms allowed us to be versatile in our feature design, and to introduce a large number of features without overfitting and without encountering computing-resource bottlenecks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3168309","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Berry","surname":"de

(co-occurrences in patients).\n A novel embedding model is designed to extract knowledge from disease comorbidities by learning from a large-scale EHR database comprising more than 35 million inpatient cases spanning nearly a decade, revealing significant improvements on disease phenotyping over current computational approaches.\n In addition, the use of the proposed methodology is extended to discover novel disease-gene associations by including valuable domain knowledge from genome-wide association studies.\n To evaluate our approach, its effectiveness is compared against a held-out set where, again, it revealed very compelling results.\n For selected diseases, we further identify candidate gene lists for which disease-gene associations were not studied previously.\n

Phenotype Discovery Using Unsupervised Feature Learning over Noisy, Sparse, and Irregular Clinical Data","abstract":"Inferring precise phenotypic patterns from population-scale clinical data is a core computational task in the development of precision, personalized medicine.\n The traditional approach uses supervised learning, in which an expert designates which patterns to look for (by specifying the learning task and the class labels), and where to look for them (by specifying the input variables).\n While appropriate for individual tasks, this approach scales poorly and misses the patterns that we don’t think to look for.\n Unsupervised feature learning overcomes these limitations by identifying patterns (or features) that collectively form a compact and expressive representation of the source data, with no need for expert input or labeled examples.\n Its rising popularity is driven by new deep learning methods, which have produced high-profile successes on difficult standardized problems of object recognition in images.\n Here we introduce its use for phenotype discovery in clinical data.\n This use is challenging because the largest source of clinical data – Electronic Medical Records – typically contains noisy, sparse, and irregularly timed observations, rendering them poor substrates for deep learning methods.\n Our approach couples dirty clinical data to deep learning architecture via longitudinal probability densities inferred using Gaussian process regression.\n From episodic, longitudinal sequences of serum uric acid measurements in 4368 individuals we produced continuous phenotypic features that suggest multiple population subtypes, and that accurately distinguished (0.97 AUC) the uric-acid signatures of gout vs.\n acute leukemia despite not being optimized for the task.\n The unsupervised features were as accurate as gold-standard features engineered by an expert with complete knowledge of the domain, the classification task, and the class labels.\n Our findings demonstrate the potential for achieving computational phenotype discovery at population scale.\n We expect such data-driven phenotypes to expose unknown disease variants and subtypes and to provide rich targets for genetic association studies.\n","id":"PMC3691199","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas

Challenges in summarizing and representing patient data prevent widespread practice of predictive modeling using EHRs.\n Here we present a novel unsupervised deep feature learning method to derive a general-purpose patient representation from EHR data that facilitates clinical predictive modeling.\n In particular, a three-layer stack of denoising autoencoders was used to capture hierarchical regularities and dependencies in the aggregated EHRs of about 700,000 patients from the Mount Sinai data warehouse.\n The result is a representation we name “deep patient”.\n We evaluated this representation as broadly predictive of health states by assessing the probability of patients to develop various diseases.\n We performed evaluation using 76,214 test patients comprising 78 diseases from diverse clinical domains and temporal windows.\n Our results significantly outperformed those achieved using representations based on raw EHR data and alternative feature learning strategies.\n Prediction performance for severe diabetes, schizophrenia, and various cancers were among the top performing.\n These findings indicate that deep learning applied to EHRs can derive patient representations that offer improved clinical predictions, and could provide a machine learning framework for augmenting clinical decision

biology is to reconstruct cellular signaling system in a data-driven manner.\n\n In this study, we investigate the utility of deep hierarchical neural networks in learning and representing the hierarchical organization of yeast transcriptomic machinery.\n\n\nResults\nWe have designed a sparse autoencoder model consisting of a layer of observed variables and four layers of hidden

preferences of transcription factors (TFs), and using these models to predict in vivo genomic binding sites for TFs, are key pieces in deciphering the regulatory code.\n These efforts have been frustrated by the limited availability and accuracy of TF binding site motifs, usually represented as position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs), which may match large numbers of sites and produce an unreliable list of target genes.\n Recently, protein binding microarray (PBM) experiments have emerged as a new source of high resolution data on in vitro TF binding specificities.\n PBM data has been analyzed either by estimating PSSMs or via rank statistics on probe intensities, so that individual sequence patterns are assigned enrichment scores (E-scores).\n This representation is informative but unwieldy because every TF is assigned a list of thousands of scored sequence patterns.\n Meanwhile, high-resolution in vivo TF occupancy data from ChIP-seq experiments is also increasingly available.\n We have developed a flexible discriminative framework for learning TF binding preferences from high resolution in vitro and in vivo data.\n We first trained support vector regression (SVR) models on PBM data to learn the mapping from probe sequences to binding intensities.\n We used a novel -mer based string kernel called the di-mismatch kernel to represent probe sequence similarities.\n The SVR models are more compact than E-scores, more expressive than PSSMs, and can be readily used to scan genomics regions to predict in vivo occupancy.\n Using a large data set of yeast and mouse TFs, we found that our SVR models can better predict probe intensity than the E-score method or PBM-derived PSSMs.\n Moreover, by using SVRs to score yeast, mouse, and human genomic regions, we were better able to predict genomic occupancy as measured by ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq experiments.\n Finally, we found that by training kernel-based models directly on ChIP-seq data, we greatly improved in vivo occupancy prediction, and by comparing a TF's in vitro and in vivo models, we could identify cofactors and disambiguate direct and indirect binding.\n","id":"PMC2936517","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Phaedra","surname":"Agius","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Aaron","surname":"Arvey","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"William","surname":"Chang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"William

k-mer becomes very small, and k-mer counts approach a binary variable, with most k-mers absent and a few present once.\n Thus, any statistical learning approach using k-mers as features becomes susceptible to noisy training set k-mer frequencies once k becomes large.\n To address this problem, we introduce alternative feature sets using gapped k-mers, a new classifier, gkm-SVM, and a general

motifs enable crucial understanding of the post-transcriptional regulation of RNAs.\n\n How the RBPs correctly recognize the target RNAs and why they bind specific positions is still far from clear.\n\n Machine learning-based algorithms are widely acknowledged to be capable of speeding up this process.\n\n Although many automatic tools have been developed to predict the RNA-protein binding sites from the rapidly growing multi-resource data, e.\n\ng.\n\n sequence, structure, their domain specific features and formats have posed significant computational challenges.\n\n One of current difficulties is that the cross-source shared common knowledge is at a higher abstraction level beyond the observed data, resulting in a low efficiency of direct integration of observed data across domains.\n\n The other difficulty is how to interpret the prediction results.\n\n Existing approaches tend to terminate after outputting the potential discrete binding sites on the sequences, but how to assemble them into the meaningful binding motifs is a topic worth of further investigation.\n\n\nResults\nIn viewing of these challenges, we propose a deep learning-based framework (iDeep) by using a novel hybrid convolutional neural network and deep belief network to predict the RBP interaction sites and motifs on RNAs.\n\n This new protocol is featured by transforming the original observed data into a high-level abstraction feature space using multiple layers of learning blocks, where the shared representations across different domains are integrated.\n\n To validate our iDeep method, we performed experiments on 31 large-scale CLIP-seq datasets, and our results show that by integrating multiple sources of data, the average AUC can be improved by 8% compared to the best single-source-based predictor; and through cross-domain knowledge integration at an abstraction level, it outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors by 6%.\n\n Besides the overall enhanced prediction performance, the convolutional neural network module embedded in iDeep is also able to automatically capture the interpretable binding motifs for RBPs.\n\n Large-scale experiments demonstrate that these mined binding motifs agree well with the experimentally verified results, suggesting iDeep is a promising approach in the real-world applications.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe iDeep framework not only can achieve promising performance than the state-of-the-art predictors, but also easily capture interpretable binding motifs.\n\n iDeep is available at

‘grammar’ to improve predictions.\n DanQ improves considerably upon other models across several metrics.\n For some regulatory markers, DanQ can achieve over a 50% relative improvement in the area under the precision-recall curve metric compared to related models.\n We have made the source code available at the github repository

binding of transcription factors (TFs).\n The determinants of TF binding include direct DNA sequence preferences, DNA sequence preferences of cofactors, and the local cell-dependent chromatin context.\n To explore the contribution of DNA sequence signal, histone modifications, and DNase accessibility to cell-type–specific binding, we analyzed 286 ChIP-seq experiments performed by the ENCODE Consortium.\n This analysis included experiments for 67 transcriptional regulators, 15 of which were profiled in both the GM12878 (lymphoblastoid) and K562 (erythroleukemic) human hematopoietic cell lines.\n To model TF-bound regions, we trained support vector machines (SVMs) that use flexible k-mer patterns to capture DNA sequence signals more accurately than traditional motif approaches.\n In addition, we trained SVM spatial chromatin signatures to model local histone modifications and DNase accessibility, obtaining significantly more accurate TF occupancy predictions than simpler approaches.\n Consistent with previous studies, we find that DNase accessibility can explain cell-line–specific binding for many factors.\n However, we also find that of the 10 factors with prominent cell-type–specific binding patterns, four display distinct cell-type–specific DNA sequence preferences according to our models.\n Moreover, for two factors we identify cell-specific binding sites that are accessible in both cell types but bound only in one.\n For these sites, cell-type–specific sequence models, rather than DNase accessibility, are better able to explain differential binding.\n Our results suggest that using a single motif for each TF and filtering for chromatin accessible loci is not always sufficient to accurately account for cell-type–specific binding

10-fold cross-validation.\n\n The prediction accuracies for various external datasets ranged from 87.99% to 99.21%, which are superior to those achieved with previous methods.\n\n\nConclusions\nTo our

(MHC-I) is essential for antigen presentation to cytotoxic T-cells.\n\n\nResults\nHere, we demonstrate how a simple alignment step allowing insertions and deletions in a pan-specific MHC-I binding machine-learning model enables combining information across both multiple MHC molecules and peptide lengths.\n\n This pan-allele/pan-length algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art

for this class of experiments is the problem of image segmentation, or determining which parts of a microscope image correspond to which individual cells.\n Current approaches require many hours of manual curation and depend on approaches that are difficult to share between labs.\n They are also unable to robustly segment the cytoplasms of mammalian cells.\n Here, we show that deep convolutional neural networks, a supervised machine learning method, can solve this challenge for multiple cell types across the domains of life.\n We demonstrate that this approach can robustly segment fluorescent images of cell nuclei as well as phase images of the cytoplasms of individual bacterial and mammalian cells from phase contrast images without the need for a fluorescent cytoplasmic marker.\n These networks also enable the simultaneous segmentation and identification of different mammalian cell types grown in co-culture.\n A quantitative comparison with prior methods demonstrates that convolutional neural networks have improved accuracy and lead to a significant reduction in curation time.\n We relay our experience in designing and optimizing deep convolutional neural networks for this task and outline several design rules that we found led to robust performance.\n We conclude that deep convolutional neural networks are an accurate method that require less curation time, are generalizable to a multiplicity of cell types, from bacteria to mammalian cells, and expand live-cell imaging capabilities to include multi-cell type systems.\n","id":"PMC5096676","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Van

Fast Whole-Genome Shotgun Metagenomic Classification","abstract":"With the decrease in cost and increase in output of whole-genome shotgun technologies, many metagenomic studies are utilizing this approach in lieu of the more traditional 16S rRNA amplicon technique.\n Due to the large number of relatively short reads output from whole-genome shotgun technologies, there is a need for fast and accurate short-read OTU classifiers.\n While there are relatively fast and accurate algorithms available, such as MetaPhlAn, MetaPhyler, PhyloPythiaS, and PhymmBL, these algorithms still classify samples in a read-by-read fashion and so execution times can range from hours to days on large datasets.\n We introduce WGSQuikr, a reconstruction method which can compute a vector of taxonomic assignments and their proportions in the sample with remarkable speed and accuracy.\n We demonstrate on simulated data that WGSQuikr is typically more accurate and up to an order of magnitude faster

from next generation technology, resulting in suboptimal performance for metagenomic (environmental) samples.\n\n Therefore, in recent years, new programs have been developed that optimize performance on short reads.\n\n In this work, we benchmark three metagenomic gene prediction programs and combine their predictions to improve metagenomic read gene annotation.\n\n\nResults\nWe not only analyze the programs' performance at different read-lengths like similar studies, but also separate different types of reads, including intra- and intergenic regions, for analysis.\n\n The main deficiencies are in the algorithms' ability to predict non-coding regions and gene edges, resulting in more false-positives and false-negatives than desired.\n\n In fact, the specificities of the algorithms are notably worse than the sensitivities.\n\n By combining the programs' predictions, we show significant improvement in specificity at minimal cost to sensitivity, resulting in 4% improvement in accuracy for 100 bp reads with ~1% improvement in accuracy for 200 bp reads and above.\n\n To correctly annotate the start and stop of the genes, we find that a consensus of all the predictors performs best for shorter read lengths while a unanimous agreement is better for longer read lengths, boosting annotation accuracy by 1-8%.\n\n We also demonstrate use of the classifier combinations on a real

investigations such as family classification, protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification, and protein-protein interaction prediction.\n In this method, we adopt artificial neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a single dense n-dimensional vector.\n To evaluate this method, we apply it in classification of 324,018 protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein families, where an average family classification accuracy of 93%±0.06% is obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods.\n In addition, we use ProtVec representation to predict disordered proteins from structured proteins.\n Two databases of disordered sequences are used: the DisProt database as well as a database featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-Nups).\n Using support vector machine classifiers, FG-Nup sequences are distinguished from structured protein sequences found in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a 99.8% accuracy, and unstructured DisProt sequences are differentiated from structured DisProt sequences with 100.0% accuracy.\n These results indicate

an Integration of Deep Learning and Neuroscience","abstract":"Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits.\n In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures.\n Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives.\n First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage.\n Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time.\n Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas.\n We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior.\n In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brain's specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes.\n Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism.\n We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.\n","id":"PMC5021692","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Adam

Learning Prediction of Cancer Cell Sensitivity to Drugs Based on Genomic and Chemical Properties","abstract":"Predicting the response of a specific cancer to a therapy is a major goal in modern oncology that should ultimately lead to a personalised treatment.\n High-throughput screenings of potentially active compounds against a panel of genomically heterogeneous cancer cell lines have unveiled multiple relationships between genomic alterations and drug responses.\n Various computational approaches have been proposed to predict sensitivity based on genomic features, while others have used the chemical properties of the drugs to ascertain their effect.\n In an effort to integrate these complementary approaches, we developed machine learning models to predict the response of cancer cell lines to drug treatment, quantified through IC50 values, based on both the genomic features of the cell lines and the chemical properties of the considered drugs.\n Models predicted IC50 values in a 8-fold cross-validation and an independent blind test with coefficient of determination R2 of 0.72 and 0.64 respectively.\n Furthermore, models were able to predict with comparable accuracy (R2 of 0.61) IC50s of cell lines from a tissue not used in the training stage.\n Our in silico models can be used to optimise the experimental design of drug-cell screenings by estimating a large proportion of missing IC50 values rather than experimentally measuring them.\n The implications of our results go beyond virtual drug screening design: potentially thousands of drugs could be probed in silico to systematically test their potential efficacy as anti-tumour agents based on their structure, thus providing a computational framework to identify new drug repositioning opportunities as well as ultimately be useful for personalized medicine by linking the genomic traits of patients to drug sensitivity.\n","id":"PMC3640019","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael

target, unexpected drug off-target interactions often occur, and many of them have not been recognized and characterized.\n The off-target interactions can be responsible for either therapeutic or side effects.\n Thus, identifying the genome-wide off-targets of lead compounds or existing drugs will be critical for designing effective and safe drugs, and providing new opportunities for drug repurposing.\n Although many computational methods have been developed to predict drug-target interactions, they are either less accurate than the one that we are proposing here or computationally too intensive, thereby limiting their capability for large-scale off-target identification.\n In addition, the performances of most machine learning based algorithms have been mainly evaluated to predict off-target interactions in the same gene family for hundreds of chemicals.\n It is not clear how these algorithms perform in terms of detecting off-targets across gene families on a proteome scale.\n Here, we are presenting a fast and accurate off-target prediction method, REMAP, which is based on a dual regularized one-class collaborative filtering algorithm, to explore continuous chemical space, protein space, and their interactome on a large scale.\n When tested in a reliable, extensive, and cross-gene family benchmark, REMAP outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n Furthermore, REMAP is highly scalable.\n It can screen a dataset of 200 thousands chemicals against 20 thousands proteins within 2 hours.\n Using the reconstructed genome-wide target profile as the fingerprint of a chemical compound, we predicted that seven FDA-approved drugs can be repurposed as novel anti-cancer therapies.\n The anti-cancer activity of six of them is supported by experimental evidences.\n Thus, REMAP is a valuable addition to the existing in silico toolbox for drug target identification, drug repurposing, phenotypic screening, and side effect prediction.\n The software and benchmark

gene expression omnibus (GEO) for single-gene perturbations in mammalian cells.\n We applied L1000CDS2 to prioritize small molecules that are predicted to reverse expression in 670 disease signatures also extracted from GEO, and prioritized small molecules that can mimic expression of 22 endogenous ligand signatures profiled by the L1000 assay.\n As a case study, to further demonstrate the utility

influence-relevance voter","abstract":"Background\nA number of algorithms have been \nproposed to predict the biological targets of diverse molecules.\n\n Some are structure-based, but the most common are ligand-based and use chemical fingerprints and the notion of chemical similarity.\n\n These methods tend to be computationally faster than others, making them particularly attractive tools as the amount of available data grows.\n\n\nResults\nUsing a ChEMBL-derived database covering 490,760 molecule-protein interactions and 3236 protein targets, we conduct a large-scale assessment of the performance of several target-prediction algorithms at predicting drug-target activity.\n\n We assess algorithm performance using three validation procedures: standard tenfold cross-validation, tenfold cross-validation in a simulated screen that includes random inactive molecules, and validation on an external test set composed of molecules not present in our database.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe present two improvements over current practice.\n\n First, using a modified version of the influence-relevance voter (IRV), we show that using molecule potency data can improve target prediction.\n\n Second, we demonstrate that random inactive molecules added during training can boost the accuracy of several algorithms in realistic target-prediction experiments.\n\n Our potency-sensitive version of the IRV (PS-IRV) obtains the best results on large test sets in most of the experiments.\n\n Models and software are publicly accessible through the chemoinformatics portal at

the element-specific persistent homology (ESPH) method.\n ESPH represents 3D complex geometry by one-dimensional (1D) topological invariants and retains important biological information via a multichannel image-like representation.\n This representation reveals hidden structure-function relationships in biomolecules.\n We further integrate ESPH and deep convolutional neural networks to construct a multichannel topological neural network (TopologyNet) for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and protein stability changes upon mutation.\n To overcome the deep learning limitations from small and noisy training sets, we propose a multi-task multichannel topological convolutional neural network (MM-TCNN).\n We demonstrate that TopologyNet outperforms the latest methods in the prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities, mutation induced globular protein folding free energy changes, and mutation induced membrane protein folding free energy changes.\n

applications, as it allows to verify the reasoning of the system and provides additional information to the human expert.\n Although machine learning methods are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks, they have in most cases the disadvantage of acting as a black box, not providing any information about what made them arrive at a particular decision.\n This work proposes a general solution to the problem of understanding classification decisions by pixel-wise decomposition of nonlinear classifiers.\n We introduce a methodology that allows to visualize the contributions of single pixels to predictions for kernel-based classifiers over Bag of Words features and for multilayered neural networks.\n These pixel contributions can be visualized as heatmaps and are provided to a human expert who can intuitively not only verify the validity of the classification decision, but also focus further analysis on regions of potential interest.\n We evaluate our method for classifiers trained on PASCAL VOC 2009 images, synthetic image data containing geometric shapes, the MNIST handwritten digits data set and for the pre-trained ImageNet model available as part of the Caffe open

multiple developing stages of the mouse brain.\n\n Currently, the ISH images are annotated with anatomical terms manually.\n\n In this paper, we propose a computational approach to annotate gene expression pattern images in the mouse brain at various structural levels over the course of development.\n\n\nResults\nWe applied deep convolutional neural network that was trained on a large set of natural images to extract features from the ISH images of developing mouse brain.\n\n As a baseline representation, we applied invariant image feature descriptors to capture local statistics from ISH images and used the bag-of-words approach to build image-level representations.\n\n Both types of features from multiple ISH image sections of the entire brain were then combined to build 3-D, brain-wide gene expression representations.\n\n We employed regularized learning methods for discriminating gene expression patterns in different brain structures.\n\n Results show that our approach of using convolutional model as feature extractors achieved superior performance in annotating gene expression patterns at multiple levels of brain structures throughout four developing ages.\n\n Overall, we achieved average AUC of 0.894 ± 0.014, as compared with 0.820 ± 0.046 yielded by the bag-of-words approach.\n\n\nConclusions\nDeep convolutional neural network model trained on natural image sets and applied to gene expression pattern annotation tasks yielded superior performance, demonstrating its transfer learning property is applicable to such biological image sets.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4432953","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Zeng","email":"tzeng@cs.odu.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rongjian","surname":"Li","email":"rli@cs.odu.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ravi","surname":"Mukkamala","email":"mukka@cs.odu.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jieping","surname":"Ye","email":"jpye@umich.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuiwang","surname":"Ji","email":"sji@cs.odu.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1534/g3.116.033654","date":"2016-11-22","title":"Accurate

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR

cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/hdi.12549","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Monocyte/lymphocyte ratio as a better predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients: a prospective cohort study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte counts-rapid and simple parameter of systemic inflammation and stress in critically ill","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2147/TCRM.S206930","date":"2019-05-08","title":"Neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio as an early new marker in AIV-H7N9-infected patients: a retrospective study","abstract":"Background: Avian AIV-H7N9 influenza progresses rapidly and has a high fatality rate.\n However, it lacks an early effective biomarker to predict disease severity and fatal outcomes successfully.\n Our study aimed to explore whether the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) taken within 24 h after admission can predict disease severity and fatality in AIV-H7N9-infected patients.\n","id":"PMC6661995","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pengfei","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hainv","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meifang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Yi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianhe","surname":"Gan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinzhong","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weihong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenhong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lanjuan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nanshan Chen MZ, Xuan Dong, Jieming Qu, et al.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

stage","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Patients with critical illness due to infection with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) show rapid disease progression to acute respiratory failure.\n\n The study aimed to screen the most useful predictive factor for critical illness caused by COVID-19.\nMethods\nid='Par2'>The study prospectively involved 61 patients with COVID-19 infection as a derivation cohort, and 54 patients as a validation cohort.\n\n The predictive factor for critical illness was selected using LASSO regression analysis.\n\n A nomogram based on non-specific laboratory indicators was built to predict the probability of critical illness.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as an independent risk factor for critical illness in patients with COVID-19 infection.\n\n The NLR had an area under receiver operating characteristic of 0.849 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.707 to 0.991) in the derivation cohort and 0.867 (95% CI 0.747 to 0.944) in the validation cohort, the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision and clinical impact curves showed that the NLR had high standardized net benefit.\n\n In addition, the incidence of critical illness was 9.1% (1/11) for patients aged???50 and having an NLR?&lt;?3.13, and 50% (7/14) patients with age???50 and NLR???3.13 were predicted to develop critical illness.\n\n Based on the risk stratification of NLR according to age, this study has developed a COVID-19 pneumonia management process.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>We found that NLR is a predictive factor for early-stage prediction of patients infected with COVID-19 who are likely to develop critical illness.\n\n Patients aged???50 and having an NLR???3.13 are predicted to develop critical illness, and they should thus have rapid access to an intensive care unit if necessary.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7237880","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jingyuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yao","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Pu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haofeng","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chuansheng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianbo","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yanli","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meihua","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bing","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guiqin","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yanbin","surname":"Wang","email":"wangyanbin01@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhihai","surname":"Chen","email":"chenzhihai0001@126.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xianbo","surname":"Wang","email":"wangxb@ccmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}],"References

worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is associated with a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARSCoV).\n\n We did clinical and experimental studies to

and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in

patients with obstructive colorectal cancer","abstract":"BACKGROUND\nObstructive colorectal cancer (OCC) is always accompanied by severe complications, and the optimal strategy for patients with OCC remains undetermined.\n\n Different from emergency surgery (ES), self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) as a bridge to surgery (BTS), could increase the likelihood of primary anastomosis.\n\n However, the stent failure and related complications might give rise to a high recurrence rate.\n\n Few studies have focused on the indications for either method, and the relationship between preoperative inflammation indexes and the prognosis of OCC is still underestimated.\n\n\nAIM\nTo explore the indications for ES and BTS in OCCs based on preoperative inflammation indexes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred and twenty-eight patients who underwent ES or BTS from 2008 to 2015 were enrolled.\n\n Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to define the optimal preoperative inflammation index and its cutoff point.\n\n Kaplan–Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models were applied to assess the association between the preoperative inflammation indexes and the survival outcomes [overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)].\n\n Stratification analysis was performed to identify the subgroups that would benefit from ES or BTS.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOS and DFS were comparable between the ES and BTS groups (P &gt; 0.05).\n\n ROC curve analysis showed derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) as the optimal biomarker for the prediction of DFS in ES (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n Lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) was recommended for BTS with regard to OS and DFS (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n dNLR was related to stoma construction (P = 0.001), pneumonia (P = 0.054), and DFS (P = 0.009) in ES.\n\n LMR was closely related to lymph node invasion (LVI) (P = 0.009), OS (P = 0.020), and DFS (P = 0.046) in the BTS group.\n\n dNLR was an independent risk factor for ES in both OS (P = 0.032) and DFS (P = 0.016).\n\n LMR affected OS (P = 0.053) and DFS (P = 0.052) in the BTS group.\n\n LMR could differentiate the OS between the ES and BTS groups (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPreoperative dNLR and LMR could predict OS and DFS in patients undergoing ES and BTS, respectively.\n\n For OCC, as the potential benefit group, patients with a low LMR might be preferred for BTS via SEMS

collection forms.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48

enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients

findings from 81 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nA cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were successively reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled.\n\n Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ?1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (&gt;1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (&gt;2 weeks to 3 weeks).\n\n Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups.\n\n\nFindings\n81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled.\n\n The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49·5 years (SD 11·0).\n\n The mean number of involved lung segments was 10·5 (SD 6·4) overall, 2·8 (3·3) in group 1, 11·1 (5·4) in group 2, 13·0 (5·7) in group 3, and 12·1 (5·9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments).\n\n In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]).\n\n Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21).\n\n Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4).\n\n\nInterpretation\nCOVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1–3 weeks.\n\n Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159053","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Heshui","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyu","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nanchuan","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yukun","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Osamah","surname":"Alwalid","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanqing","surname":"Fan","email":"1024932023@qq.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuansheng","surname":"Zheng","email":"hqzcsxh@sina.com","contributions":"0"}],"References

their capacity to predict mortality, particularly the AST/ALT ratio, commonly referred to as the De Ritis ratio, is unknown.\n\n We investigated the association between the De Ritis ratio on admission and in?hospital mortality in 105 consecutive patients with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID?19) admitted to three COVID?19 referral centres in Sardinia, Italy.\n\n The De Ritis ratio was significantly lower in survivors than nonsurvivors (median: 1.25; IQR: 0.91?1.64 vs 1.67; IQR: 1.38?1.97, P = .\n\n002) whilst there were no significant between?group differences in ALT and AST

Kaplan?Meier survival curves showed a significant association between the De Ritis ratio and mortality (logrank test P = .\n\n014).\n\n By contrast, no associations were observed between the ALT and

Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae.\n Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and

designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or

2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

pathophysiology of acute and post-acute manifestations of COVID-19 (long COVID-19) is understudied.\n Endothelial cells are sentinels lining the innermost layer of blood vessel that gatekeep micro- and macro-vascular health by sensing pathogen/danger signals and secreting vasoactive molecules.\n SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily affects the pulmonary system, but accumulating evidence suggests that it also affects the pan-vasculature in the extrapulmonary systems by directly (via virus infection) or indirectly (via cytokine storm), causing endothelial dysfunction (endotheliitis, endothelialitis and endotheliopathy) and multi-organ injury.\n Mounting evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to multiple instances of endothelial dysfunction, including reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, oxidative stress, endothelial injury, glycocalyx/barrier disruption, hyperpermeability, inflammation/leukocyte adhesion, senescence, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), hypercoagulability, thrombosis and many others.\n Thus, COVID-19 is deemed as a (micro)vascular and endothelial disease.\n Of translational relevance, several candidate drugs which are endothelial protective have been shown to improve clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients.\n The purpose of this review is to provide a latest summary of biomarkers associated with endothelial cell activation in COVID-19 and offer mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of endothelial activation/dysfunction in macro- and micro-vasculature of COVID-19 patients.\n We envisage further

coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lanying","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David M.","surname":"Ojcius","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chungen","surname":"Pan","email":"chungenp@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shibo","surname":"Jiang","email":"shibojiang@fudan.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1164/rccm.2014P7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel Wuhan (2019-nCoV) coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.78.15.7863-7866.2004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus phylogeny: toward consensus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia (trial version 7) [J / OL].

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21.

tissue by transmission electron microscopic examination in a 33?year?old male patient of T cell lymphoma, who acquired MERS?CoV infection.\n\n Tissue needle biopsies were obtained from brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle.\n\n All samples were collected within 45 min from death to reduce tissue decomposition and artefact.\n\n Histopathological examination showed necrotising pneumonia, pulmonary diffuse alveolar damage, acute kidney injury, portal and lobular hepatitis and myositis with muscle atrophic changes.\n\n The brain and heart were histologically unremarkable.\n\n Ultrastructurally, viral particles were localised in the pneumocytes, pulmonary macrophages, renal proximal tubular epithelial cells and macrophages infiltrating the skeletal muscles.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe results highlight the pulmonary and extrapulmonary pathological changes of MERS?CoV infection and provide the first evidence of the viral presence in human renal tissue, which suggests tissue trophism for MERS?CoV in kidney.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7165512","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Khaled

to determine the clinical characteristics and the outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection.\n\n\nPatients and methods\nThis study included 32 laboratory confirmed MERS corona virus infected patients who were admitted into ICU.\n\n It included 20 (62.50%) males and 12 (37.50%) females.\n\n The mean age was 43.99 ± 13.03 years.\n\n Diagnosis was done by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for corona virus on throat swab, sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens.\n\n Clinical characteristics, co-morbidities and outcome were reported for all subjects.\n\n\nResults\nThe main symptoms among the included patients were: fever (96.87%), cough (93.75%), dyspnea (90.62%), sore throat (75%), runny

statistically significant difference in the duration of symptoms before hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and ICU and total hospital stay between the expired group and survivors

SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor to invade human cells.\n\n Thus, ACE2 is the key to understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n This study is to investigate the ACE2 expression in various human tissues in order to provide insights into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We compared ACE2 expression levels across 31 normal human tissues between males and females and between younger (ages ? 49?years) and older (ages &gt;?49?years) persons using two-sided Student’s t test.\n\n We also investigated the correlations between ACE2 expression and immune signatures in various tissues using Pearson’s correlation test.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>ACE2 expression levels were the highest in the small intestine, testis, kidneys, heart, thyroid, and adipose tissue, and were the lowest in the blood, spleen, bone marrow, brain, blood vessels, and muscle.\n\n ACE2 showed medium expression levels in the lungs, colon, liver, bladder, and adrenal gland.\n\n ACE2 was not differentially expressed between males and females or between younger and older persons in any tissue.\n\n In the skin, digestive system, brain, and blood vessels, ACE2 expression levels were positively associated with immune signatures in both males and females.\n\n In the thyroid and lungs, ACE2 expression levels were positively and negatively associated with immune signatures in males and females, respectively, and in the lungs they had a positive and a negative correlation in the older and younger groups, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Our data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may infect other tissues aside from the lungs and infect persons with different sexes, ages, and races equally.\n\n The different host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection may partially explain why males and females, young and old persons

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

and receptors of human coronaviruses","abstract":"The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency.\n Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells.\n Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung.\n SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry.\n To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins.\n Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules.\n Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP.\n Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs.\n We also conducted “CellPhoneDB” analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues.\n We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.\n","id":"PMC7156119","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Furong","surname":"Qi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shen","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuye","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41575-019-0125-y","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cholangiocyte

(SARS) associated coronavirus (SARS?CoV) in SARS patients: implications for pathogenesis and virus transmission pathways","abstract":"We previously identified the major pathological changes in the respiratory and immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but gained little information on the organ distribution of SARS?associated coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS?CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS?CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS?CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS.\n SARS?CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle.\n These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS?CoV may also be targets of SARS?CoV infection.\n The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS?CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection.\n In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS?CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission.\n This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS?CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways.\n This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS.\n Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great

causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been characterized by fever, respiratory, and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as shedding of virus RNA into feces.\n\n We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published gastrointestinal symptoms and detection of virus in stool and also summarized data from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected data from the cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong (N = 59; diagnosis from February 2 through February 29, 2020),and searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and 3 Chinese databases through March 11, 2020, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\n\n We analyzed pooled data on the prevalence of overall and individual gastrointestinal symptoms (loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort) using a random effects model.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 59 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 15 patients (25.4%) had gastrointestinal symptoms, and 9 patients (15.3%) had stool that tested positive for virus RNA.\n\n Stool viral RNA was detected in 38.5% and 8.7% among those with and without diarrhea, respectively (P = .\n\n02).\n\n The median fecal viral load was 5.1 log10 copies per milliliter in patients with diarrhea vs 3.9 log10 copies per milliliter in patients without diarrhea (P = .\n\n06).\n\n In a meta-analysis of 60 studies comprising 4243 patients, the pooled prevalence of all gastrointestinal symptoms was 17.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.3–24.5); 11.8% of patients with nonsevere COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 4.1–29.1), and 17.1% of patients with severe COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 6.9–36.7).\n\n In the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of stool samples that were positive for virus RNA was 48.1% (95% CI, 38.3–57.9); of these samples, 70.3% of those collected after loss of virus from respiratory specimens tested positive for the virus (95% CI, 49.6–85.1).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn an analysis of data from the Hong Kong cohort of patients with COVID-19 and a meta-analysis of findings from publications, we found that 17.6% of patients with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n Virus RNA was detected in stool samples from 48.1% patients, even in stool collected after respiratory samples had negative test results.\n\n Health care workers should therefore exercise caution in collecting fecal samples or performing endoscopic procedures in patients with COVID-19, even during patient recovery.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7194936","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ka Shing","surname":"Cheung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ivan

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"N.

2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were successively reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled.\n\n Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ?1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (&gt;1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (&gt;2 weeks to 3 weeks).\n\n Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups.\n\n\nFindings\n81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled.\n\n The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49·5 years (SD 11·0).\n\n The mean number of involved lung segments was 10·5 (SD 6·4) overall, 2·8 (3·3) in group 1, 11·1 (5·4) in group 2, 13·0 (5·7) in group 3, and 12·1 (5·9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments).\n\n In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]).\n\n Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21).\n\n Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4).\n\n\nInterpretation\nCOVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1–3 weeks.\n\n Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159053","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Heshui","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyu","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nanchuan","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yukun","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Osamah","surname":"Alwalid","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanqing","surname":"Fan","email":"1024932023@qq.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuansheng","surname":"Zheng","email":"hqzcsxh@sina.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Liver histology in ICU patients dying from sepsis: a clinico-pathological study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Systemic viral infections and collateral damage in the liver","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1585","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Excessive neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps contribute to acute lung injury of influenza pneumonitis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Simvastatin improves neutrophil function and clinical outcomes in pneumonia.

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),

rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died

pneumonia were enrolled and divided into seven groups according to the treatment option.\n Information including age, sex, and duration from illness onset to admission, clinical manifestations, and laboratory data at admission, and length of hospital stay were evaluated.\n The chest computed tomography (CT) imaging obtained at admission and after a 5?day treatment cycle were assessed.\n The clinical symptoms and laboratory tests at discharge were also assessed.\n At admission, no significant differences were found among the groups, including the duration from illness onset to admission, clinical symptoms, and main laboratory results.\n No significant differences were found among the groups in terms of the proportion of patients with pneumonia resolution (P?=?.\n151) after treatment or the length of hospital stay (P?=?.\n116).\n At discharge, 7 of 184 (4%) patients had a mild cough while their other symptoms had disappeared, and the proportion of patients with abnormal liver function and with increased leukocytes, neutrophils or erythrocyte sedimentation rate among the 184 patients were close to those at admission.\n According to the results, the inclusion of antiviral drugs in therapeutic regimens based on symptomatic treatment had no significant additional impact on the improvement in COVID?19 patients.\n In addition, the results of chest CT imaging, clinical

globally, more than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (8273 cases, 775 deaths) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (1139 cases, 431 deaths) caused in 2003 and 2013, respectively.\n COVID?19 has spread to 46 countries internationally.\n Total fatality rate of COVID?19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC).\n Average incubation period of COVID?19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0 to 24 days.\n The basic reproductive number (R0\n) of COVID?19 ranges from 2 to 3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS.\n A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID?19. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem.\n A total of 3019 health workers were infected by 12 February 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan.\n Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease spectrum of COVID?19 may differ from SARS or MERS.\n We summarize latest literatures on genetic, epidemiological, and clinical features of COVID?19 in comparison to SARS and MERS and emphasize special measures on diagnosis and potential interventions.\n This review will improve our understanding of the unique features of COVID?19 and enhance our control measures in the

gastrointestinal symptoms (loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort) using a random effects model.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 59 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 15 patients (25.4%) had gastrointestinal symptoms, and 9 patients (15.3%) had stool that tested positive for virus RNA.\n\n Stool viral RNA was detected in 38.5% and 8.7% among those with and without diarrhea, respectively (P = .\n\n02).\n\n The median fecal viral load was 5.1 log10 copies per milliliter in patients with diarrhea vs 3.9 log10 copies per milliliter in patients without diarrhea (P = .\n\n06).\n\n In a meta-analysis of 60 studies comprising 4243 patients, the pooled prevalence of all gastrointestinal symptoms was 17.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.3–24.5); 11.8% of patients with nonsevere COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 4.1–29.1), and 17.1% of patients with severe COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 6.9–36.7).\n\n In the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of stool samples that were positive for virus RNA was 48.1% (95% CI, 38.3–57.9); of these samples, 70.3% of those collected after loss of virus from respiratory specimens tested positive for the virus (95% CI, 49.6–85.1).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn an analysis of data from the Hong Kong cohort of patients with COVID-19 and a meta-analysis of findings from publications, we found that 17.6% of patients with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n Virus RNA was detected in stool samples from 48.1% patients, even in stool collected after respiratory samples had negative test results.\n\n Health care workers should therefore exercise caution in collecting fecal samples or performing endoscopic procedures in patients with COVID-19, even during patient recovery.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7194936","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ka Shing","surname":"Cheung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivan

SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted from person to person and, in 2 months, has caused more than 82?000 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 2800 deaths in 46 countries.\n\n The total number of cases and deaths has surpassed that of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n Although both COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) manifest as pneumonia, COVID-19 is associated with apparently more efficient transmission, fewer cases of diarrhoea, increased mental confusion, and a lower crude fatality rate.\n\n However, the underlying virus–host interactive characteristics conferring these observations on transmissibility and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 remain unknown.\n\n\nMethods\nWe systematically investigated the cellular susceptibility, species tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2 and compared findings with those for SARS-CoV.\n\n We compared SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in different cell lines with one-way ANOVA.\n\n For the area under the curve comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in Calu3 (pulmonary) and Caco2 (intestinal) cells, we used Student's t test.\n\n We analysed cell damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with one-way ANOVA.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated to comparable levels in human Caco2 cells and Calu3 cells over a period of 120 h (p=0·52).\n\n By contrast, SARS-CoV infected and replicated more efficiently in Caco2 cells than in Calu3 cells under the same multiplicity of infection (p=0·0098).\n\n SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV, replicated modestly in U251 (neuronal) cells (p=0·036).\n\n For animal species cell tropism, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated in non-human primate, cat, rabbit, and pig cells.\n\n SARS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV-2, infected and replicated in Rhinolophus sinicus bat kidney cells.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 consistently induced significantly delayed and milder levels of cell damage than did SARS-CoV in non-human primate cells (VeroE6, p=0·016; FRhK4, p=0·0004).\n\n\nInterpretation\nAs far as we know, our study presents the first quantitative data for tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2.

the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS?CoV?2.\nMethods\nPubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched.\n\n Several studies on the clinical characteristics of SARS?CoV?2 infection were collected for meta?analysis.\n\n\nResults\nTen studies were included in Meta?analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with SARS?CoV?2 infection.\n\n Meta?analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 0.891 (95% CI: 0.818, 0.945), the

PET Parkinson’s disease-related pattern as a biomarker for clinical trials in early stage disease","abstract":"Background\nThe development of therapeutic interventions for Parkinson disease (PD) is challenged by disease complexity and subjectivity of symptom evaluation.\n\n A Parkinson's Disease Related Pattern (PDRP) of glucose metabolism via fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been reported to correlate with motor symptom scores and may aid the detection of disease-modifying therapeutic effects.\n\n\nObjectives\nWe sought to independently evaluate the potential utility of the PDRP as a biomarker for clinical trials of early-stage PD.\n\n\nMethods\nTwo machine learning approaches (Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM) and NPAIRS with Canonical Variates Analysis) were performed on FDG-PET scans from 17 healthy controls (HC) and 23 PD patients.\n\n The approaches were compared regarding discrimination of HC from PD and relationship to motor symptoms.\n\n\nResults\nBoth classifiers discriminated HC from PD (p?&lt;?0.01, p?&lt;?0.03), and classifier scores for age- and gender- matched HC and PD correlated with Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage (R2?=?0.24, p?&lt;?0.015) and UPDRS (R2?=?0.23, p?&lt;?0.018).\n\n Metabolic patterns were highly similar, with hypometabolism in parieto-occipital and prefrontal regions and hypermetabolism in cerebellum, pons, thalamus, paracentral gyrus, and lentiform nucleus relative to whole brain, consistent with the PDRP.\n\n An additional classifier was developed using only PD subjects, resulting in scores that correlated with UPDRS (R2?=?0.25, p?&lt;?0.02) and Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage (R2?=?0.16, p?&lt;?0.06).\n\n\nConclusions\nTwo independent analyses performed in a cohort of mild PD patients replicated key features of the PDRP, confirming that FDG-PET and multivariate classification can provide an objective, sensitive biomarker of disease stage with the potential to detect treatment effects on PD progression.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6120603","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dawn

models for diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19: systematic review and critical appraisal","abstract":"Objective\nTo review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at increased risk of becoming infected with covid-19 or being admitted to hospital with the disease.\n\n\nDesign\nLiving systematic review and critical appraisal.\n\n\nData sources\nPubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 7 April 2020.\nStudy selection\nStudies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model.\n\n\nData extraction\nAt least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool).\n\n\nResults\n4909 titles were screened, and 51 studies describing 66 prediction models were included.\n\n The review identified three models for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 47 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 (34 were based on medical imaging); and 16 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay.\n\n The most frequently reported predictors of presence of covid-19 included age, body temperature, signs and symptoms, sex, blood pressure, and creatinine.\n\n The most frequently reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age and features derived from computed tomography scans.\n\n C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.85 to 0.99 in prognostic models.\n\n All models were rated at high or unclear risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and vague reporting.\n\n Most reports did not include any description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of the model predictions was rarely assessed.\n\n\nConclusion\nPrediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed.\n\n This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic.\n\n Hence, we do not recommend any of these reported prediction models to be used in current practice.\n\n Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies and collaboration are urgently needed to develop more rigorous prediction models, and validate promising ones.\n\n The predictors identified in included models should be considered as candidate predictors for new models.\n\n Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions.\n\n Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.\n\n\nSystematic review registration\nProtocol

died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase;

Aims\nSome patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have abnormal liver function.\n\n We aimed to clarify the features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide references for clinical treatment.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a retrospective, single-center study of 148 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 (73 female, 75 male; mean age, 50 years) at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 through January 31, 2020. Patient outcomes were followed until February 19, 2020. Patients were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications, and length of hospital stay.\n\n Abnormal liver function was defined as increased levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin.\n\n\nResults\nFifty-five patients (37.2%) had abnormal liver function at hospital admission; 14.5% of these patients had high fever (14.5%), compared with 4.3% of patients with normal liver function (P = .\n\n027).\n\n Patients with abnormal liver function were more likely to be male, and had higher levels of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein.\n\n There was no statistical difference between groups in medications taken before hospitalization; a significantly higher proportion of patients with abnormal liver function (57.8%) had received lopinavir/ritonavir after admission compared to patients with normal liver function (31.3%).\n\n Patients with abnormal liver function had longer mean hospital stays (15.09 ± 4.79 days) than patients with normal liver function (12.76 ± 4.14 days) (P = .\n\n021).\n\n\nConclusions\nMore than one third of patients admitted to the hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection have abnormal liver function, and this is associated with longer hospital stay.\n\n A significantly higher proportion of patients with abnormal liver function had received lopinavir/ritonavir after admission; these drugs should be given with

Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male.\n\n Median (interquartile range) age was 65.0 (56.0–70.0) years.\n\n Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (n = 7; 25.0%).\n\n Eight (28.6%) patients were suspected to have hospital-associated transmission.\n\n The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (n = 23, 82.1%), dry cough (n = 22, 81%), and dyspnoea (n = 14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (n = 23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (n = 23, 82.1%), anaemia (n = 21, 75.0%), and hypoproteinaemia (n = 25, 89.3%).\n\n The common chest computed tomography (CT) findings were ground-glass opacity (n = 21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (n = 13, 46.3%).\n\n A total of 15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and the mortality rate was 28.6%.\n\n If the last antitumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.079, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.086–15.322, P = 0.037].\n\n Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk of developing severe events (HR = 5.438, 95% CI 1.498–19.748, P = 0.010).\n\n\nConclusions\nCancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection.\n\n It is recommended that cancer patients receiving antitumour treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 coinfection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270947","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"L.","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"F.","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"L.","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"C.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"R.","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Jia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"H.Q.","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"L.","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y.","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Q.","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Q.","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.Y.","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.P.","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"EASL

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally.\n\n Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0–16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China.\n\n We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 8·3 [SD 3·5] years) were identified to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures.\n\n 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]).\n\n Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]).\n\n Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38·5°C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37·5–38·5°C.\n\n Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]).\n\n Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB.\n\n All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir–ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation.\n\n Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days.\n\n By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAlthough all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in

compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support.\n\n Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment.\n\n This report is based on data from patients who received remdesivir during the period from January 25, 2020, through March 7, 2020, and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, data from 8 could not be analyzed (including 7 patients with no post-treatment data and 1 with a dosing error).\n\n Of the 53 patients whose data were analyzed, 22 were in the

outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients With Digestive Symptoms in Hubei, China: A Descriptive, Cross-Sectional, Multicenter Study","abstract":"OBJECTIVE:\nSince the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, various digestive symptoms have been frequently reported in patients infected with the virus.\n\n In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms.\n\n\nMETHODS:\nIn this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment.\n\n Data were followed up until March 18, 2020.\nRESULTS:\nIn the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed.\n\n The average age was 52.9 years (SD ± 16), including 107 men and 97 women.\n\n Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases).\n\n If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.\n\n Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days).\n\n In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms.\n\n As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced.\n\n Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms.\n\n\nDISCUSSION:\nWe found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels.\n\n Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms.\n\n However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7172492","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mi","surname":"Mu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pengcheng","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Runsheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junhong","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pibao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Baoguang","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xun","surname":"Niu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongyu","surname":"Ping","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yingzhen","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianzhi","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guogang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qinyong","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.019","date":"2020-03-15","title":"Coronavirus

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41

secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to

in patients with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD).\n\n\nAims\nTo summarise the changes in liver function tests during SARS?CoV?2 infection and the impact of COVID?19 in patients with underlying CLD.\n\n\nMethods\nA literature review using online database PubMed was done using the search terms “SARS?CoV?2”, “COVID?19”, “liver”, “cirrhosis” and “liver transplantation”.\n\n\nResults\nCOVID?19 is frequently associated with different degrees of abnormal liver function tests, most notably transaminases, which are usually transitory and of mild degree.\n\n Available evidence suggests that liver injury may result from direct pathogenic effect by the virus, systemic inflammation or toxicity from commonly used drugs in this subset of patients.\n\n SARS?CoV?2 infection in children is associated with minimal or no increase in liver enzymes, thus the presence of abnormal liver function tests should trigger evaluation for underlying liver diseases.\n\n Although it seems that patients with CLD are not at greater risk for acquiring the infection, those with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, non?alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver diseases or liver transplant may have a greater risk for severe COVID?19.\nConclusions\nAbnormal liver function tests during the course of COVID?19 are common, though clinically significant liver injury is rare.\n\n Further research is
