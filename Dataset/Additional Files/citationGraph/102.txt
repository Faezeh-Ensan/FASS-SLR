Fecal samples were collected 2 or 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge; disease was categorized as mild (no radiographic evidence of pneumonia), moderate (pneumonia was present), severe (respiratory rate ?30/min, or oxygen saturation ?93% when breathing ambient air), or critical (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or organ failure requiring intensive care).\n\n We compared microbiome data with those from 6 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 15 healthy individuals (controls).\n\n We assessed gut microbiome profiles in association with disease severity and changes in fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2.\nResults\nPatients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in fecal microbiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of opportunistic pathogens and depletion of beneficial commensals, at time of hospitalization and at all timepoints during hospitalization.\n\n Depleted symbionts and gut dysbiosis persisted even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (determined from throat swabs) and resolution of respiratory symptoms.\n\n The baseline abundance of Coprobacillus, Clostridium ramosum, and Clostridium hathewayi correlated with COVID-19 severity; there was an inverse correlation between abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (an anti-inflammatory bacterium) and disease severity.\n\n Over the course of hospitalization, Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides massiliensis, and Bacteroides ovatus, which downregulate expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in murine gut, correlated inversely with SARS-CoV-2 load in fecal samples from patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn a pilot study of 15 patients with COVID-19, we found persistent alterations in the fecal microbiome during the time of hospitalization, compared with controls.\n\n Fecal microbiota alterations were associated with fecal levels of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity.\n\n Strategies to alter the intestinal microbiota might reduce disease severity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7237927","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Zuo","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":" Fen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Grace C.Y.","surname":"Lui","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Yun Kit","surname":"Yeoh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Amy Y.L.","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Hui","surname":"Zhan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Yating","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Arthur C.K.","surname":"Chung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Chun Pan","surname":"Cheung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Nan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Christopher K.C.","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Zigui","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Eugene Y.K.","surname":"Tso","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Kitty S.C.","surname":"Fung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Veronica","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Lowell","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Gavin","surname":"Joynt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" David S.C.","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Francis K.L.","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Paul K.S.","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"                           Siew C.","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Onder G, Rezza G, Brusaferro S.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaolin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xingwang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuelei","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangfa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongmeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Wang","email":"wangjw28@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"caobin_ben@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and GI tissues.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 95 patients, 58 cases exhibited GI symptoms of which 11 (11.6%) occurred on admission and 47 (49.5%) developed during hospitalisation.\n\n Diarrhoea (24.2%), anorexia (17.9%) and nausea (17.9%) were the main symptoms with five (5.3%), five (5.3%) and three (3.2%) cases occurred on the illness onset, respectively.\n\n A substantial proportion of patients developed diarrhoea during hospitalisation, potentially aggravated by various drugs including antibiotics.\n\n Faecal samples of 65 hospitalised patients were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, including 42 with and 23 without GI symptoms, of which 22 (52.4%) and 9 (39.1%) were positive, respectively.\n\n Six patients with GI symptoms were subjected to endoscopy, revealing oesophageal bleeding with erosions and ulcers in one severe patient.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in oesophagus, stomach, duodenum and rectum specimens for both two severe patients.\n\n In contrast, only duodenum was positive in one of the four non-severe patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nGI tract may be a potential transmission route and target organ of SARS-CoV-2.\n","id":"PMC7316116","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiayang","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhenling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Siwen","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhenyi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxiong","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liangqing","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Honggang","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Mai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xianqi","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Renxu","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhixiang","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaofeng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaofeng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30113-4","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Viral

health emergency.\n Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases.\n Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets.\n Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.\n A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option.\n Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.\n Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral

coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)) has caused outbreaks of pneumonia in Wuhan, China.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via cell receptor ACE II (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2).\n\n In order to identify possible prime target cells of SARS-CoV-2 by comprehensive dissection of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 coexpression pattern in different cell types, five datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of lung, oesophagus, gastric mucosa, ileum and colon were analysed.\n\n\nDesign\nFive datasets were searched, separately integrated and analysed.\n\n Violin plot was used to show the distribution of differentially expressed genes for different clusters.\n\n The ACE2-expressing and TMPRRSS2-expressing cells were highlighted and dissected to characterise the composition and proportion.\n\n\nResults\nCell types in each dataset were identified by known markers.\n\n ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were not only coexpressed in lung AT2 cells and oesophageal upper epithelial and gland cells but also highly expressed in absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon.\n\n Additionally, among all the coexpressing cells in the normal digestive system and lung, the expression of ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in the ileum and colon.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study provides the evidence of the potential route of SARS-CoV-2 in the digestive system along with the respiratory tract based on single-cell transcriptomic analysis.\n\n This finding may have a significant impact on health policy setting regarding the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Our study also demonstrates a novel method to identify the prime cell types of a virus by the coexpression pattern analysis of single-cell sequencing

Coexpressing new and previously identified Hartnup disorder–causing missense mutations of B0AT1 with either collectrin or ACE2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that the high-frequency D173N and the newly identified P265L mutant B0AT1 transporters can still be activated by ACE2 but not collectrin coexpression.\n\n In contrast, the human A69T and R240Q B0AT1 mutants cannot be activated by either of the associated proteins, although they function as wild-type B0AT1 when expressed alone.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe thus show that ACE2 is necessary for the expression of the Hartnup transporter in intestine and suggest that the differential functional association of mutant B0AT1 transporters with ACE2 and collectrin in intestine and kidney, respectively, participates in the phenotypic heterogeneity of human Hartnup disorder.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094282","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Simone

ADAM17-deficient mice are not viable.\n Conditional ADAM17 knockout models demonstrated proinflammatory activities of ADAM17 in septic shock via shedding of TNF.\n We used a novel gene targeting strategy to generate mice with dramatically reduced ADAM17 levels in all tissues.\n The resulting mice called ADAM17ex/ex were viable, showed compromised shedding of ADAM17 substrates from the cell

homozygous ADAM17ex/ex mice was normal, ADAM17ex/ex mice showed substantially increased susceptibility to inflammation in dextran sulfate sodium colitis.\n This was a result of impaired shedding of EGF-R ligands resulting in failure to phosphorylate STAT3 via the EGF-R and, consequently, in defective regeneration of epithelial cells and breakdown of the intestinal barrier.\n Besides regulating the systemic availability of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF, our results demonstrate that ADAM17 is needed for vital regenerative activities during the immune response.\n Thus, our mouse model will

large-bowel symptoms, and through a 16S rRNA gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach.\n MAM sample analysis revealed enrichment in aerotolerant Proteobacteria, probably selected by a gradient of oxygen that decreases from tissue to lumen, and in Streptococcus and Clostridium spp.\n, highly fermenting bacteria.\n On the other hand, LAM microbiota showed an increased abundance in Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Oscillospira, genera able to digest and to degrade biopolymers in the large intestine.\n Predicted metagenomic analysis showed LAM to be enriched in genes encoding enzymes mostly involved in energy extraction from carbohydrates and lipids, whereas MAM in amino acid and vitamin metabolism.\n Moreover, LAM and MAM communities seemed to be influenced by different host

The intestinal microbiota supports local mucosal immunity and is increasingly recognised as an important modulator of the systemic immune system.\n\n The precise role of the gut microbiota in

lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PG).\n Lipoteichoic acid and N-acetylglucosamine-containing polysaccharides enhanced virion stability in a serotype-dependent manner.\n LPS and PG also enhanced the thermostability of an intermediate reovirus particle (ISVP) that is associated with primary infection in the gut.\n Although LPS and PG alter reovirus thermostability, these bacterial envelope components did not affect reovirus utilization of its proteinaceous cellular receptor junctional adhesion molecule-A or cell entry kinetics.\n LPS and PG also did not affect the overall

frequencies due to processes restoring fitness, such as complementation and recombination.\n Indeed, we found that coinfection frequency correlated with mutation load, with 17% chimeric plaque formation for heavily mutagenized viruses.\n Importantly, the frequency of chimeric plaques may be underestimated by up to threefold, since coinfection with the same parental virus cannot be scored in

the Propagation of Swine Influenza A Virus <italic>In Vitro</italic>\n","abstract":"The control of infectious diseases such as swine influenza viruses (SwIV) plays an important role in food production both from the animal health and from the public health point of view.\n Probiotic microorganisms and other health improving food supplements have been given increasing attention in recent years, but, no information on the effects of probiotics on swine influenza virus is available.\n Here we address this question by assessing the inhibitory potential of the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 (E.\n faecium) on the replication of two porcine strains of influenza virus (H1N1 and H3N2 strain) in a continuous porcine macrophage cell line (3D4/21) and in MDBK cells.\n Cell cultures were treated with E.\n faecium at the non-toxic concentration of 1×106 CFU/ml in growth medium for 60 to 90 min before, during and after SwIV infection.\n After further incubation of cultures in probiotic-free growth medium, cell viability and virus propagation were determined at 48 h or 96 h post infection.\n The results obtained reveal an almost complete recovery of viability of SwIV infected cells and an inhibition of virus multiplication by up to four log units in the E.\n faecium treated cells.\n In both 3D4/21- and MDBK-cells a 60 min treatment with E.\n faecium stimulated nitric oxide (NO) release which is in line with published evidence for an antiviral function of NO.\n Furthermore, E.\n faecium caused a modified cellular expression of selected mediators of defence in 3D4-cells: while the expression of TNF-?, TLR-3 and IL-6 were decreased in the SwIV-infected and probiotic treated cells, IL-10 was found to be increased.\n Since we obtained experimental evidence for the direct adsorptive trapping of SwIV through E.\n faecium, this probiotic microorganism inhibits influenza viruses by at least two mechanisms, direct physical interaction and strengthening of innate defence at the cellular level.\n","id":"PMC3538747","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhenya","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weidong","surname":"Chai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Burwinkel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sven","surname":"Twardziok","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Wrede","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christiane","surname":"Palissa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bettina","surname":"Esch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael

We demonstrate here that S.\n epidermidis culture supernatants significantly suppressed the infectivity of various influenza viruses.\n Using high-performance liquid chromatography together with mass

abrogated when Embp was mutated, confirming that Embp is essential for S.\n epidermidis activity against viral infection.\n We also showed that both S.\n epidermidis bacterial particles and Embp can directly bind to influenza virus.\n Furthermore, the injection of a recombinant Embp fragment containing a fibronectin-binding domain into embryonated eggs increased the survival rate of virus-infected chicken embryos.\n For an in vivo challenge study, prior Embp intranasal inoculation in chickens suppressed the viral titres and induced the expression of antiviral cytokines in the

widespread and very rapid but transient activation of both B cells and T cells in lymphoid tissues and the blood.\n\n The mechanism of this activation has not been fully described and is the focus of the current studies.\n\n\nPrincipal Findings\nA known inducer of early lymphocyte activation is IFN?, a cytokine strongly induced by LDV infection.\n\n Neutralization of IFN? in the plasma from infected mice ablated its ability to activate lymphocytes in vitro.\n\n Since the primary source of virus-induced IFN? in vivo is often plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC's), we depleted these cells prior to LDV infection and tested for lymphocyte activation.\n\n Depletion of pDC's in vivo eradicated both the LDV-induced IFN? response and lymphocyte activation.\n\n A primary receptor in pDC's for single stranded RNA viruses such as LDV is the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) pattern recognition receptor.\n\n Infection of TLR7-knockout mice revealed that both the IFN? response and lymphocyte activation were dependent on TLR7 signaling in vivo.\n\n Interestingly, virus levels in both TLR7 knockout mice and pDC-depleted mice were indistinguishable from controls indicating that LDV is largely resistant to the systemic IFN? response.\n\n\nConclusion\nResults indicate that LDV-induced activation of lymphocytes is due to recognition of LDV nucleic acid by TLR7 pattern recognition

prevalent.\n\n Malnutrition perturbs the infant gut microbiota leading to sub-optimal functioning of the immune system and further predisposing infants to enteric infections.\n\n Therefore, we hypothesized that malnutrition exacerbates rotavirus disease severity in infants.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>In the present study, we used a neonatal germ free (GF) piglets transplanted with a two-month-old human infant’s fecal microbiota (HIFM) on protein deficient and sufficient diets.\n\n We report the effects of malnourishment on the HRV infection and the HIFM pig microbiota in feces,

significantly altered gut microbiota diversity, with an increase in Bacteroidetes and a concomitant decrease in Firmicutes phyla abundance.\n Although the increase in the Bacteroidetes phylum was consistent across several experiments, differences were observed at the family and operational taxonomic unit level.\n This suggests a change in gut conditions after viral lung infection that favors Bacteroidetes outgrowth but not individual families.\n No change in gut microbiota composition was observed after LAIV vaccination, suggesting that the driver of gut microbiota change is specific to

Coriobacteriaceae, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, unclassified Lachnospiraceae and unclassified Ruminococcaceae were decreased.\n The inferred metagenomic information of gut microbiota in CHB showed 21 enriched and 17 depleted KEGG level-2 pathways.\n Four OTUs, OTU38 (Streptococcus), OTU124 (Veillonella), OTU224 (Streptococcus), and OTU55 (Haemophilus), had high correlations with hosts' hepatic

alterations in patients with stage 4 hepatitis C","abstract":"Background\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) causes debilitating liver diseases, which may progress to cirrhosis and cancer, and claims 500,000 annual lives worldwide.\n\n While HCV epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapy are being deeply studied, rare attention is given to reciprocal interactions between HCV infection , HCV-induced chronic liver diseases, and the human gut microbiome.\n\n As Egypt has the world’s highest prevalence of HCV infections, we launched this study to monitor differences in the gut microbial community composition of Egyptian HCV patients that may affect, or result from, the patients’ liver state.\n\n\nResults\nTo this end, we analyzed stool samples from six stage 4-HCV patients and eight healthy individuals by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing using Illumina MiSeq.\n\n Overall, the alpha-diversity of the healthy persons’ gut microbiomes was higher than those of the HCV patients.\n\n Whereas members of phylum Bacteroidetes were more abundant in HCV patients, healthy individuals had higher abundance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria.\n\n Genus-level analysis showed differential abundance of Prevotella and Faecalibacterium (higher in HCV patients) vs.\n\n Ruminococcus and Clostridium (healthy group), indicating that the higher abundance of Bacteroidetes in HCV patients is most likely due to Prevotella overabundance.\n\n The probiotic genus, Bifidobacterium, was only observed in the microbiotas of healthy individuals.\n\n\nConclusions\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study provides a first overview of major phyla and genera differentiating stage 4-HCV patients from healthy individuals and suggests possible microbiome remodeling in chronic hepatitis C, possibly shaped by bacterial translocation as well as the liver’s impaired role in digestion and protein synthesis.\n\n Future studies will investigate the microbiome composition and functional

infections such as influenza (flu).\n Caloric restriction represents a known strategy to slow many aging processes, including those involving the immune system.\n More recently, some changes in the microbiome have been described with aging, while the gut microbiome appears to influence responses to flu vaccination and infection.\n With these considerations in mind, we used a well-established mouse model of flu infection to explore the impact of flu infection, aging, and caloric restriction on the gut microbiome.\n Young, middle-aged, and aged caloric restricted (CR) and ad lib fed (AL) mice were examined after a sublethal flu infection.\n All mice lost 10–20% body weight and, as expected for these early time points, losses were similar at different ages and between diet groups.\n Cytokine and chemokine levels were also similar with the notable exception of IL-1?, which rose more than fivefold in aged AL mouse serum, while it remained unchanged in aged CR serum.\n Fecal microbiome phyla abundance profiles were similar in young, middle-aged, and aged AL mice at baseline and at 4?days post flu infection, while increases in Proteobacteria were evident at 7?days post flu infection in all three age groups.\n CR mice, compared to AL mice in each age group, had increased abundance of Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia at all time points.\n Interestingly, principal coordinate analysis determined that diet exerts a greater effect on the microbiome than age or flu infection.\n Percentage body weight loss correlated with the relative abundance of Proteobacteria regardless of age, suggesting flu pathogenicity is related to Proteobacteria abundance.\n Further, several microbial Operational Taxonomic Units from the Bacteroidetes phyla correlated with serum chemokine/cytokines regardless of both diet and age suggesting an interplay between flu-induced systemic inflammation and gut microbiota.\n These exploratory studies highlight the impact of caloric restriction on fecal microbiome in both young and aged animals, as well as the many complex relationships between flu responses and gut microbiota.\n Thus, these preliminary studies provide the necessary groundwork to examine how gut microbiota alterations may be leveraged to influence declining immune responses with aging.\n","id":"PMC5611400","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jenna

is great interest in identifying, characterizing, and understanding factors that initiate these changes.\n Despite their high prevalence, studies have only recently begun to investigate how viral lung infections have an impact on the gut microbiota.\n There is also considerable interest in whether the gut microbiota could be manipulated during vaccination to improve efficacy.\n In this highly controlled study, we aimed to establish the effect of viral lung infection on gut microbiota composition and the gut environment using mouse models of common respiratory pathogens respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus.\n This was then compared to the effect of live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccination.\n Both RSV and influenza virus infection resulted in significantly altered gut microbiota diversity, with an increase in Bacteroidetes and a concomitant decrease in Firmicutes phyla abundance.\n Although the increase in the Bacteroidetes phylum was consistent across several experiments, differences were observed at the family and operational taxonomic unit level.\n This suggests a change in gut conditions after viral lung infection that favors Bacteroidetes outgrowth but not individual families.\n No change in gut microbiota composition was observed after LAIV vaccination, suggesting that the driver of gut microbiota change is specific to live viral infection.\n Viral lung infections also resulted in an increase in fecal lipocalin-2, suggesting low-grade gut inflammation, and colonic Muc5ac levels.\n Owing to the important role that mucus plays in the gut environment, this may explain the changes in microbiota composition observed.\n This study demonstrates that the gut microbiota and the gut environment are altered following viral lung infections and that these changes are not observed during vaccination.\n Whether increased mucin levels and gut inflammation drive, or are a result of, these changes is still to be

Here, we identify members of the microbiota that protect against respiratory infection by the major human pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae.\n We show that the microbiota enhances respiratory defenses via granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling, which stimulates pathogen killing and clearance by alveolar macrophages through extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling.\n Increased pulmonary GM-CSF production in response to infection is primed by the microbiota through interleukin-17A.\n By combining models of commensal colonization in antibiotic-treated and germ-free mice, using cultured commensals from the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria phyla, we found that potent Nod-like receptor-stimulating bacteria in the upper airway (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and intestinal microbiota (Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus crispatus and Clostridium

health, and a well-recognized sequela is bacterial pneumonia.\n Given this connection, we sought to characterize the upper respiratory tract microbiota of individuals suffering from the pandemic H1N1 influenza A outbreak of 2009 and determine if microbiome profiles could be correlated with patient characteristics.\n We determined the microbial profiles of 65 samples from H1N1 patients by cpn60

authority, sample type and designation (STAT/non-STAT).\n At the phylum level, Actinobacteria-, Firmicutes- and Proteobacteria-dominated microbiomes were observed, with none of the patient characteristics showing significant profile composition differences.\n At the nearest neighbor “species” level, the upper respiratory tract microbiomes were composed of 13-20 “species” and showed a trend towards increasing diversity with patient age.\n Interestingly, at an individual level, most patients had one to three organisms dominant in their microbiota.\n A limited number of discrete microbiome profiles were observed, shared among influenza patients regardless of patient status variables.\n To assess the validity of analyses derived from sequence read abundance, several bacterial species were quantified by quantitative PCR and compared to the abundance of cpn60 sequence read counts obtained in the study.\n A strong positive correlation between read abundance and absolute

(Virochip) and deep sequencing, for the identification and characterization of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus.\n Using nasopharyngeal swabs collected during the earliest stages of the pandemic in Mexico, Canada, and the United States (n?=?17), the Virochip was able to detect a novel virus most closely related to swine influenza viruses without a priori information.\n Deep sequencing yielded reads corresponding to 2009 H1N1 influenza in each sample (percentage of aligned sequences corresponding to 2009 H1N1 ranging from 0.0011% to 10.9%), with up to 97% coverage of the influenza genome in one sample.\n Detection of 2009 H1N1 by deep sequencing was possible even at titers near the limits of detection for specific RT-PCR, and the percentage of sequence reads was linearly correlated with virus titer.\n Deep sequencing also provided insights into the upper respiratory microbiota and host gene expression in response to 2009 H1N1 infection.\n An unbiased analysis combining sequence data from all 17 outbreak samples revealed that 90% of the 2009 H1N1 genome could be assembled de novo without the use of any reference sequence, including assembly of several near full-length genomic segments.\n These results indicate that a streamlined metagenomics detection strategy can potentially replace the multiple conventional diagnostic tests required to investigate an outbreak of a novel pathogen, and provide a blueprint for comprehensive diagnosis of unexplained acute illnesses or outbreaks in clinical and public health settings.\n","id":"PMC2956640","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander L.","surname":"Greninger","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eunice

occurs primarily in fall and winter.\n It is unknown whether seasonal infection patterns are associated with concomitant changes in NP microbiota.\n As young children are generally prone to respiratory and invasive infections, we characterized the NP microbiota of 96 healthy children by barcoded pyrosequencing of the V5–V6 hypervariable region of the 16S-rRNA gene, and compared microbiota composition between children sampled in winter/fall with children sampled in spring.\n The approximately 1000000 sequences generated represented 13 taxonomic phyla and approximately 250 species-level phyla types (OTUs).\n The 5 most predominant phyla were Proteobacteria (64%), Firmicutes (21%), Bacteroidetes (11%), Actinobacteria (3%) and Fusobacteria (1,4%) with Moraxella, Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Flavobacteria, Dolosigranulum, Corynebacterium and Neisseria as predominant genera.\n The inter-individual variability was that high that on OTU level a core microbiome could not be defined.\n Microbiota profiles varied strongly with season, with in fall/winter a predominance of Proteobacteria (relative abundance (% of all sequences): 75% versus 51% in spring) and Fusobacteria (absolute abundance (% of children): 14% versus 2% in spring), and in spring a predominance of Bacteroidetes (relative abundance: 19% versus 3% in fall/winter, absolute abundance: 91% versus 54% in fall/winter), and Firmicutes.\n The latter increase is mainly due to (Brevi)bacillus and Lactobacillus species (absolute abundance: 96% versus 10% in fall/winter) which are like Bacteroidetes species generally related to healthy ecosystems.\n The observed seasonal effects could not be attributed to recent antibiotics or viral co-infection.\n","id":"PMC3046172","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Debby","surname":"Bogaert","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bart","surname":"Keijser","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Huse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Rossen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Reinier","surname":"Veenhoven","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elske","surname":"van

Microbiome Diversity Changes over Time in Children with Asthma","abstract":"Background\nThe nasopharynx is a reservoir for pathogens associated with respiratory illnesses such as asthma.\n\n Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been used to characterize the nasopharyngeal microbiome of infants and adults during health and disease; less is known, however, about the composition and temporal dynamics (i.\n\ne.\n\n, longitudinal variation) of microbiotas from children and adolescents.\n\n Here we use NGS technology to characterize the nasopharyngeal microbiomes of asthmatic children and adolescents (6 to 18 years) and determine their stability over time.\n\n\nMethods\nTwo nasopharyngeal washes collected 5.5 to 6.5 months apart were taken from 40 children and adolescents with asthma living in the Washington D.\n\nC.\n\n area.\n\n Sequence data from the 16S-V4 rRNA gene region (~250 bp) were collected from the samples using the MiSeq platform.\n\n Raw data were processed in mothur (SILVA123 reference database) and Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU)-based alpha- and beta-diversity metrics were estimated.\n\n Relatedness among samples was assessed using PCoA ordination and Procrustes analyses.\n\n Differences in microbial diversity and taxon mean relative proportions were assessed using linear mixed effects models.\n\n Core microbiome analyses were also performed to identify stable and consistent microbes of the nasopharynx.\n\n\nResults and Discussion\nA total of 2,096,584 clean 16S sequences corresponding to an average of 167 OTUs per sample were generated.\n\n Representatives of Moraxella*, Staphylococcus*, Dolosigranulum, Corynebacterium, Prevotella, Streptococcus*, Haemophilus*, Fusobacterium* and a Neisseriaceae genus accounted for 86% of the total reads.\n\n These nine genera have been previously found in the nasopharynxes of both infants and adults, but in different proportions.\n\n OTUs from the five genera highlighted (*) above defined the nasopharyngeal core microbiome at the 95% level.\n\n No significant differences in alpha- and beta-diversity were observed between seasons, but bacterial mean relative proportions of Haemophilus, Moraxella, Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium varied significantly between summer-fall and age groups (inter-patient variation).\n\n Additionally, OTUs varied significantly within patients between time points in 35 of the 40 patients analyzed.\n\n Future cross-sectional studies should be mindful of the temporal dynamics of the nasopharyngeal

winter, 34 subjects were colonized with at least 1 bacterium, and 11 tested positive for at least 1 virus.\n\n Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Moraxella catarrhalis, and

disease.\n S.\n aureus is a major source of severe secondary bacterial pneumonia after influenza A virus infection, which causes widespread morbidity and mortality.\n While the phenomenon of secondary bacterial pneumonia is well established, the mechanisms behind the transition from asymptomatic colonization to invasive staphylococcal disease following viral infection remains unknown.\n In this

temperatures, exogenous ATP, norepinephrine, and increased glucose.\n Mice that were colonized with S.\n aureus and subsequently exposed to these physiologic stimuli or influenza A virus coinfection developed pronounced pneumonia.\n This study provides novel insight into the transition from colonization to invasive disease, providing a better understanding of the events involved in the

disease worldwide.\n However, the mechanisms behind transition from asymptomatic colonization to dissemination and disease in otherwise sterile sites remain poorly understood but are epidemiologically strongly linked to infection with respiratory viruses.\n In this report, we show that infection with influenza A virus and treatment with the resulting host signals (febrile-range temperatures, norepinephrine, extracytoplasmic ATP, and increased nutrient availability) induce the release of bacteria from biofilms in a newly developed biofilm model on live epithelial cells both in vitro and during in vivo colonization.\n These dispersed bacteria have distinct phenotypic properties different from those of both biofilm and broth-grown, planktonic bacteria, with the dispersed population showing differential virulence gene expression characteristics resulting in a significantly increased ability to disseminate and cause infection of otherwise sterile sites, such as the middle ear, lungs, and bloodstream.\n The results offer novel and important insights into the role of interkingdom signaling between microbe and host during biofilm dispersion and transition to acute disease.\n","id":"PMC3735180","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura R.","surname":"Marks","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bruce

opportunistic pathogens.\n Individually, these Gram-positive microbes are two of the most common causative agents of secondary bacterial pneumonia following influenza A virus infection, and they constitute a significant source of morbidity and mortality.\n Since the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, rates of cocolonization with both of these bacterial species have increased, despite the traditional view that they are antagonistic and mutually exclusive.\n The interactions between S.\n pneumoniae and S.\n aureus in the context of colonization and the transition to invasive disease have not been characterized.\n In this report, we show that S.\n pneumoniae and S.\n aureus form stable dual-species biofilms on epithelial cells in vitro.\n When these biofilms are exposed to physiological changes associated with viral infection, S.\n pneumoniae disperses from the biofilm, whereas S.\n aureus dispersal is inhibited.\n These findings were supported by results of an in vivo study in which we used a novel mouse cocolonization model.\n In these experiments, mice cocolonized in the nares with both bacterial species were subsequently infected with influenza A virus.\n The coinfected mice almost exclusively developed pneumococcal pneumonia.\n These results indicate that despite our previous report that S.\n aureus disseminates into the lungs of mice stably colonized with these bacteria following influenza A virus infection, cocolonization with S.\n pneumoniae in vitro and in vivo inhibits S.\n aureus dispersal and transition to disease.\n This study provides

Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics, and early microbial exposure have all been implicated.\n Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analyzed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats to date.\n We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat’s signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals.\n The project encountered an estimated 81–99% of the genera, enzyme families, and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome.\n Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata.\n These results thus delineate the

disease (CD)-related genetic polymorphisms involved in host innate immunity are associated with shifts in human ileum–associated microbial composition in a cross-sectional analysis of human ileal samples.\n Sanger sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and 454 sequencing of 16S rRNA gene hypervariable regions (V1–V3 and V3–V5), were conducted on macroscopically disease-unaffected ileal biopsies collected from 52 ileal CD, 58 ulcerative colitis and 60 control patients without inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) undergoing initial surgical resection.\n These subjects also were genotyped for the three major NOD2 risk alleles (Leu1007fs, R708W, G908R) and the ATG16L1 risk allele (T300A).\n The samples were linked to clinical metadata, including body mass index, smoking status and Clostridia difficile infection.\n The sequences were classified into seven phyla/subphyla categories using the Naïve Bayesian Classifier of the Ribosome Database Project.\n Centered log ratio transformation of six predominant categories was included as the dependent variable in the permutation based MANCOVA for the overall composition with stepwise variable selection.\n Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were conducted to measure the relative frequencies of the Clostridium coccoides – Eubacterium rectales group and the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii spp.\n Empiric logit transformations of the relative frequencies of these two microbial groups were included in permutation-based ANCOVA.\n Regardless of sequencing method, IBD phenotype, Clostridia difficile and

host health by providing energy, nutrients, and immunological protection.\n\n Applying current molecular methods is necessary to surmount the limitations of classical culturing techniques in order to obtain an accurate description of the microbiota composition.\n\n\nResults\nHere we report on the comparative assessment of human fecal microbiota from three age-groups: infants, adults and the elderly.\n\n We demonstrate that the human intestinal microbiota undergoes maturation from birth to adulthood and is further altered with ageing.\n\n The counts of major bacterial groups Clostridium leptum, Clostridium coccoides, Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Escherichia coli were assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR).\n\n By comparing species diversity profiles, we observed age-related changes in the human fecal microbiota.\n\n The microbiota of infants was generally characterized by low levels of total bacteria.\n\n C.\n\n leptum and C.\n\n coccoides species were highly represented in the microbiota of infants, while elderly subjects exhibited high levels of E.\n\n coli and Bacteroidetes.\n\n We observed that the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes evolves during different life stages.\n\n For infants, adults and elderly individuals we measured ratios of 0.4, 10.9 and 0.6, respectively.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this work we have confirmed that qPCR is a powerful technique in studying the diverse and complex fecal microbiota.\n\n Our work demonstrates that the fecal microbiota composition evolves throughout life, from early childhood to old age.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2702274","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"D","surname":"Mariat","email":"denis.mariat@jouy.inra.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"O","surname":"Firmesse","email":"o.firmesse@AFSSA.FR","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"F","surname":"Levenez","email":"florence.levenez@jouy.inra.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"VD","surname":"Guimar?es","email":"valeria.guimaraes@cea.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"H","surname":"Sokol","email":"sokol_harry@yahoo.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J","surname":"Doré","email":"joel.dore@jouy.inra.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"G","surname":"Corthier","email":"gerard.corthier@jouy.inra.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J-P","surname":"Furet","email":"jean-pierre.furet@jouy.inra.fr","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.1198469","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Induction

demonstrate that mucosal-associated microbiota is comprised of Firmicutes (50.9%±21.3%), Bacteroidetes (40.2%±23.8%) and Proteobacteria (8.6%±4.7%), and that interindividual differences were apparent.\n Among the genera, Bacteroides, Leuconostoc and Weissella were present at high abundance (4.6% to 41.2%) in more than 90% of the studied biopsy samples.\n Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Acidovorax, Acinetobacter, Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Veillonella, and several unclassified bacterial groups were also ubiquitously present at an abundance &lt;7.0% of total microbial community.\n With the exception of one individual, the mucosal-associated microbiota was relatively homogeneous along the colon (average 61% Bray-Curtis similarity).\n However, micro-heterogeneity was observed in biopsy duplicates within defined colonic sites for three of the individuals.\n A weak but significant Mantel correlation of 0.13 was observed between the abundance of acidomucins and mucosal-associated microbiota (P-value ?=? 0.04), indicating that the localized biochemical differences may contribute in part to the micro-heterogeneity.\n This study provided a detailed insight to

bowel-cleansing preparations.\n\n We examined if colonic lavage changes the natural state of enteric mucosal-adherent microbes in healthy human subjects.\n\n\nMethods\nTwelve healthy individuals were divided into three groups; experimental group, control group one, and control group two.\n\n Subjects in the experimental group underwent an un-prepped flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies.\n\n Within two weeks, subjects were given a standard polyethylene glycol-based bowel cleansing preparation followed by a second flexible sigmoidoscopy.\n\n Subjects in control group one underwent two un-prepped

Reconstruction for Metagenomic Data and Its Application to the Human Microbiome","abstract":"Microbial communities carry out the majority of the biochemical activity on the planet, and they play integral roles in processes including metabolism and immune homeostasis in the human microbiome.\n Shotgun sequencing of such communities' metagenomes provides information complementary to organismal abundances from taxonomic markers, but the resulting data typically comprise short reads from hundreds of different organisms and are at best challenging to assemble comparably to single-organism genomes.\n Here, we describe an alternative approach to infer the functional and metabolic potential of a microbial community metagenome.\n We determined the gene families and pathways present or absent within a community, as well as their relative abundances, directly from short sequence reads.\n We validated this methodology using a collection of synthetic metagenomes, recovering the presence and abundance both of large pathways and of small functional modules with high accuracy.\n We subsequently applied this method, HUMAnN, to the microbial communities of 649 metagenomes drawn from seven primary body sites on 102 individuals as part of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP).\n This provided a means to compare functional diversity and organismal ecology in the human microbiome, and we determined a core of 24 ubiquitously present modules.\n Core pathways were often implemented by different enzyme families within different body sites, and 168 functional modules and 196 metabolic pathways varied in metagenomic abundance specifically to one or more niches within the microbiome.\n These included glycosaminoglycan degradation in the gut, as well as phosphate and amino acid transport linked to host phenotype (vaginal pH) in the posterior fornix.\n An implementation of our methodology is available at http://huttenhower.\nsph.\nharvard.\nedu/humann.\n This provides a means to accurately and efficiently characterize microbial metabolic pathways and functional modules directly from high-throughput sequencing reads, enabling the determination of community roles in

ability to extract energy from otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides1–6.\n Studies of a small number of unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S rRNA genes6–8, yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut microbiome) remains obscure.\n Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is utilized and stored3–5.\n To address the question of how host genotype, environmental exposures, and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome, we have characterized the fecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers.\n Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes.\n The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person’s gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs.\n However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable ‘core microbiome’ at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage level.\n Obesity is associated with phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity, and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways.\n These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from this core are associated with different physiologic states (obese versus

Gut-Associated Immunostimulating Microbe Inferred by Whole-Genome Sequencing","abstract":"Numerous microbes inhabit the mammalian intestinal track and strongly impact host physiology; however, our understanding of this ecosystem remains limited owing to the high complexity of the microbial community and the presence of numerous non-culturable microbes.\n Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFBs), which are clostridia-related Gram-positive bacteria, are among such non-culturable populations and are well known for their unique morphology and tight attachment to intestinal epithelial cells.\n Recent studies have revealed that SFBs play crucial roles in the post-natal maturation of gut immune function, especially the induction of Th17 lymphocytes.\n Here, we report the complete genome sequence of mouse SFBs.\n The genome, which comprises a single circular chromosome of 1 620 005 bp, lacks genes for the biosynthesis of almost all amino acids, vitamins/cofactors and nucleotides, but contains a full set of genes for sporulation/germination and, unexpectedly, for chemotaxis/flagella-based motility.\n These findings suggest a triphasic lifestyle of the SFB, which comprises two types of vegetative (swimming and epicellular parasitic) phases and a dormant (spore) phase.\n Furthermore, SFBs encode four types of flagellin, three of which are recognized by Toll-like receptor 5 and

Mapping of the Gastrointestinal Microbiota Identifies Children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease","abstract":"Background\nPediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is challenging to diagnose because of the non-specificity of symptoms; an unequivocal diagnosis can only be made using colonoscopy, which clinicians are reluctant to recommend for children.\n\n Diagnosis of pediatric IBD is therefore frequently delayed, leading to inappropriate treatment plans and poor outcomes.\n\n We investigated the use of 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples and new analytical methods to assess differences in the microbiota of children with IBD and other gastrointestinal disorders.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe applied synthetic learning in microbial ecology (SLiME) analysis to 16S sequencing data obtained from i) published surveys of microbiota diversity in IBD and ii) fecal samples from 91 children and young adults who were treated in the gastroenterology program of Children’s Hospital (Boston, USA).\n\n The developed method accurately distinguished control samples from those of patients with IBD; the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) value was 0.83 (corresponding to 80.3% sensitivity and 69.7% specificity at a set threshold).\n\n The accuracy was maintained among data sets collected by different sampling and sequencing methods.\n\n The method identified taxa associated with disease states and distinguished patients with Crohn’s disease from those with ulcerative colitis with reasonable accuracy.\n\n The findings were validated using samples from an additional group of 68 patients; the validation test identified patients with IBD with an AUC value of 0.84 (e.\n\ng.\n\n 92% sensitivity, 58.5% specificity).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nMicrobiome-based diagnostics can distinguish pediatric patients with IBD from patients with similar symptoms.\n\n Although this test can not replace endoscopy and histological examination as diagnostic tools, classification based on microbial diversity is an effective complementary technique for IBD detection in pediatric patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3387146","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Eliseo","surname":"Papa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Docktor","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Smillie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"Weber","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sarah

to sample and characterize microbial genomes.\n\n Massive datasets of metagenomic sequences have been accumulated, but analysis of these sequences has focused primarily on the descriptive comparison of the relative abundance of proteins that belong to specific functional categories.\n\n More robust statistical methods are needed to make inferences from metagenomic data.\n\n In this study, we developed and applied a suite of tools to describe and compare the richness, membership, and structure of microbial communities using peptide fragment sequences extracted from metagenomic sequence data.\n\n\nResults\nApplication of these tools to acid mine drainage, soil, and whale fall metagenomic sequence collections revealed groups of peptide fragments with a relatively high abundance and no known function.\n\n When combined with analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments from the same communities these tools enabled us to demonstrate that although there was no overlap in the types of 16S rRNA gene sequence observed, there was a core collection of operational protein families that was shared among the three environments.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe results of comparisons between the three habitats were surprising considering the relatively low overlap of membership and the distinctively different characteristics of the three habitats.\n\n These tools will facilitate the use of metagenomics to

functional annotation of metagenomic sequences—starts with the identification of protein functions or families (e.\ng.\n, KO families for the KEGG database and the FIG families for the SEED database) in the query sequences, followed by a direct mapping of the identified protein families onto pathways.\n Given a predicted patchwork of individual biochemical steps, some metric must be applied in deciding what pathways actually exist in the genome or metagenome represented by the sequences.\n Commonly, and straightforwardly, a complete biological pathway can be identified in a dataset if at least one of the steps associated with the pathway is found.\n We report, however, that this naïve mapping approach leads to an inflated estimate of biological pathways, and thus overestimates the functional diversity of the sample from which the DNA sequences are derived.\n We developed a parsimony approach, called MinPath (Minimal set of Pathways), for biological pathway reconstructions using protein family predictions, which yields a more conservative, yet more faithful, estimation of the biological pathways for a query dataset.\n MinPath identified far fewer pathways for the genomes collected in the KEGG database—as compared to the naïve mapping approach—eliminating some obviously spurious pathway annotations.\n Results from applying MinPath to several metagenomes indicate that

Intestinal Enteroendocrine L Cells","abstract":"It has long been speculated that metabolites, produced by gut microbiota, influence host metabolism in health and diseases.\n Here, we reveal that indole, a metabolite produced from the dissimilation of tryptophan, is able to modulate the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from immortalized and primary mouse colonic L cells.\n Indole increased GLP-1 release during short exposures, but it reduced secretion over longer periods.\n These effects were attributed to the ability of indole to affect two key molecular mechanisms in L

GLP-1 secretion.\n On the other hand, indole slowed ATP production by blocking NADH dehydrogenase, thus leading to a prolonged reduction of GLP-1 secretion.\n Our results identify indole as a

Pathway Downstream of Toll-Like Receptor Activation in Irritable Bowel Syndrome","abstract":"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a disorder of the brain-gut axis, is characterised by the absence of reliable biological markers.\n Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that serves as a precursor to serotonin but which can alternatively be metabolised along the kynurenine pathway leading to the production of other neuroactive agents.\n We previously reported an increased degradation of tryptophan along this immunoresponsive pathway in IBS.\n Recently, altered cytokine production following activation of specific members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family (TLR1-9) has also been demonstrated in IBS.\n However, the relationship between TLR activation and kynurenine pathway activity in IBS is unknown.\n In this study, we investigated whether activation of specific TLRs elicits exaggerated kynurenine production in IBS patients compared to controls.\n Whole blood from IBS patients and healthy controls was cultured with a panel of nine different TLR agonists for 24?h.\n Cell culture supernatants were then analyzed for both tryptophan and kynurenine concentrations, as were plasma samples from both cohorts.\n IBS subjects had an elevated plasma kynurenine:tryptophan ratio compared to healthy controls.\n Furthermore, we demonstrated a differential downstream profile of kynurenine production subsequent to TLR activation in IBS patients compared to healthy controls.\n This profile included alterations at TLR1/2, TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, TLR7, and TLR8. Our data expands on our previous understanding of altered tryptophan metabolism in IBS and suggests that measurement of tryptophan metabolites downstream of TLR activation may ultimately find utility as components of a biomarker panel to aid gastroenterologists in the diagnosis of IBS.\n Furthermore, these studies implicate the modulation of TLRs as means through which aberrant tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway can be controlled, a novel potential therapeutic strategy in this and other disorders.\n","id":"PMC3357104","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gerard","surname":"Clarke","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Declan P.","surname":"McKernan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabor","surname":"Gaszner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eamonn M.","surname":"Quigley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John F.","surname":"Cryan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Timothy G.","surname":"Dinan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.bbr.2009.07.008","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Chain reactions: early-life stress alters the metabolic profile of plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids in adulthood","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1210/me.2014-1108","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Minireview: gut microbiota: the neglected endocrine organ","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/annotation/5fb9fa6f-4889-4407-8430-6dfc7ecdfbdd","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Correction: Metabolic Signatures of Extreme Longevity in Northern Italian Centenarians Reveal a Complex Remodeling of Lipids, Amino Acids, and Gut Microbiota Metabolism","abstract":"","id":"PMC3742787","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sebastiano","surname":"Collino","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ivan","surname":"Montoliu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"François-Pierre J.","surname":"Martin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Max","surname":"Scherer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniela","surname":"Mari","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefano","surname":"Salvioli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Bucci","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rita","surname":"Ostan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniela","surname":"Monti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elena","surname":"Biagi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrizia","surname":"Brigidi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claudio","surname":"Franceschi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Serge","surname":"Rezzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1574-6941.2007.00299.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Characterization of skatole-producing microbial populations in enriched swine lagoon slurry","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1093/carcin/21.4.757","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Dysplasia and cancer in the dextran sulfate sodium mouse colitis model.

was given to five subjects in each dose cohort (n = 20).\n Blood and urine were collected for measurement of melatonin and 6-hydroxymelatonin, and symptoms and physiological measures were assessed.\n Validated sleep scales were completed.\n No adverse effects after oral melatonin, other than mild transient drowsiness with no effects on sleeping patterns, were seen, and no symptoms were reported.\n Melatonin was rapidly cleared at all doses with a median [range] elimination half-life of 51.7 [29.5–63.2] min across all doses.\n There was considerable variability in maximum melatonin levels within each dose cohort, but 6-hydoxymelatonin sulfate levels were less variable and remained stable for several hours.\n For the ex vivo study, blood from 20 volunteers was treated with lipopolysaccharide

Manipulation of tryptophan levels, acutely or chronically, by depletion or supplementation, is an experimental procedure for modifying peripheral and central serotonin levels.\n These studies have allowed us to establish the role of serotonin in higher order brain function in both preclinical and clinical situations and have precipitated the finding that low brain serotonin levels are associated with poor memory and depressed mood.\n The gut-brain axis is a bi-directional system between the brain and gastrointestinal tract, linking emotional and cognitive centres of the brain with peripheral functioning of the digestive tract.\n An influence of gut microbiota on behaviour is becoming increasingly evident, as is the extension to tryptophan and serotonin, producing a possibility that alterations in the gut may be important in the pathophysiology of human central nervous system disorders.\n In this review we will discuss the effect of manipulating tryptophan on mood and

influence metabolic homeostasis of the host.\n Utilising a systems-biology approach combining in-depth 1H-NMR-based metabonomics (plasma, liver and skeletal muscle) with microbiome profiling (small intestine, colon and faeces) of AhR knockout (AhR?/?) and wild-type (AhR+/+) mice, we assessed AhR function in host metabolism.\n Microbiome metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids were found to regulate AhR and its target genes in liver and intestine.\n The AhR signalling pathway, in turn, was able to influence microbiome composition in the small intestine as evident from microbiota profiling of the AhR+/+ and AhR?/? mice fed with diet enriched with a specific AhR ligand or diet depleted of any known AhR ligands.\n The AhR?/? mice also displayed increased levels of corticosterol and alanine in serum.\n In addition, activation of gluconeogenic genes in the AhR?/? mice was indicative of on-going metabolic stress.\n Reduced levels of ketone bodies and reduced expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism in the liver further underscored this observation.\n Interestingly, exposing AhR?/? mice to a high-fat diet showed resilience to glucose intolerance.\n Our data suggest the existence of a bidirectional AhR-microbiome axis, which influences host metabolic

versus regulatory T cells (Treg) involved in tolerance.\n While environmental AHR ligands can mediate this effect, endogenous ligands are likely to be more relevant in host immune responses.\n We investigated downstream metabolites of tryptophan as potential AHR ligands because (1) tryptophan metabolites have been implicated in regulating the balance between Th17 and Treg cells and (2) many of the AHR ligands identified thus far are derivatives of tryptophan.\n We characterized the ability of tryptophan metabolites to bind and activate the AHR and to increase IL-22 production in human T cells.\n We report that the tryptophan metabolite, cinnabarinic acid (CA), is an AHR ligand that stimulates the differentiation of human and mouse T cells producing IL-22. We compare the IL-22-stimulating activity of CA to that of other tryptophan metabolites and define stimulation conditions that lead to CA production from immune cells.\n Our findings link tryptophan

remains unknown, the most accepted hypothesis of IBD pathogenesis to date is that an aberrant immune response against the gut microbiota is triggered by environmental factors in a genetically susceptible host.\n The advancement of next-generation sequencing technology has enabled identification of various alterations of the gut microbiota composition in IBD.\n While some results related to dysbiosis in IBD are different between studies owing to variations of sample type, method of investigation, patient profiles, and medication, the most consistent observation in IBD is reduced

clearance and detoxification5.\n Thus, CYP1 enzymes appear to play an important feedback role that curtails the duration of AHR signalling6, but it remains elusive whether they also regulate AHR

Cyp1a1 throughout the body or restricted specifically to intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) resulted in loss of AHR-dependent type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells and increased susceptibility to enteric infection.\n The deleterious effects of excessive AHR ligand degradation on intestinal immune functions could be counter-balanced by increasing the intake of AHR

immunologic reactivity to enteric commensal organisms in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\n Since intestinal inflammation is present in a subset of patients with both pediatric and adult spondyloarthritis (SpA), we hypothesized that SpA patients may also have altered microbiota and immune responsiveness to enteric organisms.\n\n\nMethods\nStool and blood specimens were collected from children with enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) and non-inflammatory controls.\n\n DNA purified from stool was subject to PCR amplification and sequencing of the variable IV region from the 16S rDNA gene.\n\n IgA and IgG Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) were performed on select species of bacteria in most subjects.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-five children with ERA and 13 controls were included.\n\n The ERA patients had less Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (3.8% versus 10%, P = 0.008) and lachnospiraceae family (12 versus 7.0%, P = 0.020), a statistically significant increase in bifidobacterium (1.8% versus 0%, P = 0.032) and a non-statistically significant increase in Bacteroides (21% versus 11%, P = 0.150).\n\n Akkermansia muciniphila was abundant (&gt;2%) in 7/27 ERA patients but none of the controls (P = 0.072.) Cluster analysis revealed two clusters of ERA patients: Cluster one (n = 8) was characterized by high levels of Bacteroides genus, while a second (n = 15) cluster had similar levels as the controls.\n\n Seven of 17 (41%) of the ERA subjects in Cluster 2 compared to 0/8 of the subjects in Cluster 1 had abundant Akkermansia muciniphila (P = 0.057).\n\n Serum IgA and IgG antibody levels against F.\n\n prausnitzii and B.\n\n fragilis were similar between patients and controls, whereas the two groups showed divergent responses when the fecal relative abundances of F.\n\n prausnitzii and Bacteroides were compared individually against IgA antibody levels recognizing F.\n\n prausnitzii and B.\n\n fragilis, respectively.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe abundance of F.\n\n prausnitzii in the

not been fully elucidated.\n This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of melatonin on intestinal integrity in a rat model of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) to evaluate whether melatonin prevented intestine barrier dysfunction and reduced bacterial translocation.\n Forty male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups, with 8 rats in the sham operation (SO) group, 18 rats in the SAP group and 14 SAP rats in the melatonin treatment (MT) group.\n SAP was induced by retrograde injection of 4% taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct.\n Melatonin was administered 30 min prior to taurocholate injection in the melatonin-treated rats.\n All rats were sacrificed 24 h subsequent to pancreatitis induction.\n Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect and quantify Escherichia coli (E.\n coli) O157 in postcava blood.\n The microvilli structure was also analyzed with transmission electron microscopy.\n The level of E.\n coli DNA in the MT group was significantly lower than in rats in the SAP group.\n No E.\n coli DNA was detected in the control group.\n Villus height and crypt depth in the ileum were significantly higher in the MT and control groups compared to the SAP group, and were significantly higher in the MT group than in the SAP group.\n These results suggested that melatonin prevented gut

collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n Epidemiological studies have provided strong evidence that IBD patients bear increased risk for the development of colorectal cancer (CRC).\n However, the impact of the microbiota on the development of colitis-associated cancer (CAC) remains largely unknown.\n In this study, we established a new model of CAC using azoxymethane

AOM-WT mice were colitis-free and developed only rare adenomas.\n Importantly, tumor multiplicity directly correlated with the presence of colitis.\n Il10?/? mice mono-associated with the mildly colitogenic bacterium Bacteroides vulgatus displayed significantly reduced colitis and colorectal tumor multiplicity compared to Il10?/? mice.\n Germ-free AOM-treated Il10?/? mice showed normal colon

direct demonstration that manipulation of the intestinal microbiota alters the development of CAC.\n The TLR/MyD88 pathway is essential for microbiota-induced development of CAC.\n Unlike findings

Mucosa-Associated Microbiota Determine Physiological Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in Murine Colon","abstract":"Many colonic mucosal genes that are highly regulated by microbial signals are differentially expressed along the rostral-caudal axis.\n This would suggest that differences in regional microbiota exist, particularly mucosa-associated microbes that are less likely to be transient.\n We therefore explored this possibility by examining the bacterial populations associated with the normal proximal and distal colonic mucosa in context of host Toll-like receptors (TLR) expression in C57BL/6J mice housed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) environments.\n 16S rRNA gene-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library analysis revealed significant differences in the community structure and diversity of the mucosa-associated microbiota located in the distal colon compared to proximal colon and stool, the latter two clustering closely.\n Differential expression of colonic TLR2 and TLR4 along the proximal-distal axis was also found in SPF mice, but not in GF mice, suggesting that enteric microbes are essential in maintaining the regional expression of these TLRs.\n TLR2 is more highly expressed in proximal colon and decreases in a gradient to distal while TLR4 expression is highest in distal colon and a gradient of decreased expression to proximal colon is observed.\n After transfaunation in GF mice, both regional colonization of mucosa-associated microbes and expression of TLRs in the mouse colon were reestablished.\n In addition, exposure of the distal colon to cecal (proximal) microbiota induced TLR2 expression.\n These results demonstrate that regional colonic mucosa-associated microbiota determine the region-specific expression of TLR2 and TLR4. Conversely, region-specific host assembly rules are essential in determining the structure and function of mucosa-associated microbial populations.\n We believe this type of host-microbial mutualism is pivotal to the maintenance of intestinal and immune homeostasis.\n","id":"PMC2962643","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yunwei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suzanne","surname":"Devkota","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark W.","surname":"Musch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bana","surname":"Jabri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cathryn","surname":"Nagler","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dionysios A.","surname":"Antonopoulos","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexander","surname":"Chervonsky","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eugene B.","surname":"Chang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ching-Hong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ching-Hong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1159/000096906","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Decreased serum tryptophan concentration predicts poor prognosis in malignant melanoma patients","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/AEM.02458-07","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Catabolic pathway for the production of skatole and indoleacetic acid by the acetogen Clostridium drakei, Clostridium scatologenes, and swine manure","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.semcancer.2005.07.008","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Immune suppression in cancer: effects on immune cells, mechanisms and future therapeutic intervention","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1080/19490976.2016.1156827","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The microbiota-derived metabolite indole decreases mucosal inflammation and injury in a murine model of NSAID enteropathy","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1073/pnas.0812874106","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Metabolomics analysis reveals large effects of gut microflora on mammalian blood metabolites","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.chom.2014.09.001","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Discovery and characterization of gut microbiota decarboxylases that can produce the neurotransmitter tryptamine","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0170208","date":"2017-01-02","title":"The Gut-Brain Axis in Healthy Females: Lack of Significant Association between Microbial Composition and Diversity with Psychiatric Measures","abstract":"Objective\nThis study examined associations between the composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota and measures of depression, anxiety, eating disorder psychopathology, stress, and personality in a group of healthy adult females.\n\n\nMethods\nFemale participants (n = 91) ages 19–50 years with BMI 18.5–25 kg/m2 were recruited from central North Carolina between July 2014 and March 2015.

of 16S rRNA genes to determine the overall structure of microbiota in patients with colorectal cancer and healthy controls; we investigated microbiota of the intestinal lumen, the cancerous tissue and matched noncancerous normal tissue.\n Moreover, we investigated the mucosa-adherent microbial composition using rectal swab samples because the structure of the tissue-adherent bacterial community is potentially altered following bowel cleansing.\n Our findings indicated that the microbial structure of the intestinal lumen and cancerous tissue differed significantly.\n Phylotypes that enhance energy harvest from diets or perform metabolic exchange with the host were more abundant in the lumen.\n There were more abundant Firmicutes and less abundant Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in lumen.\n The overall microbial structures of cancerous tissue and noncancerous tissue were similar; howerer the tumor microbiota exhibited lower diversity.\n The structures of the intestinal lumen microbiota and mucosa-adherent microbiota were different in CRC patients compared to matched microbiota in healthy individuals.\n Lactobacillales was enriched in cancerous tissue, whereas Faecalibacterium was reduced.\n In the mucosa-adherent microbiota, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Blautia were reduced in CRC patients, whereas Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus, and Mogibacterium were enriched.\n In the lumen, predominant phylotypes related to metabolic disorders or metabolic exchange with the host, Erysipelotrichaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Coriobacteriaceae were increased in cancer patients.\n Coupled with previous reports, these results suggest that the intestinal microbiota is associated with CRC risk and that intestinal lumen microflora potentially influence CRC risk via cometabolism or metabolic exchange with the host.\n However, mucosa-associated microbiota potentially affects CRC risk primarily through direct interaction with the

the ileal microbiome, and host genetics in murine models of ileitis.\n\n\nMethods\nWe induced ileal inflammation of graded severity in C57BL6 mice by gavage with Toxoplasma gondii, Giardia muris, low dose indomethacin (LDI;0.1 mg/mouse), or high dose indomethacin (HDI;1 mg/mouse).\n\n The composition and spatial distribution of the mucosal microbiome was evaluated by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization.\n\n Mucosal E.\n\n coli were enumerated by quantitative PCR, and characterized by phylogroup, genotype and pathotype.\n\n\nResults\nModerate to severe ileitis induced by T.\n\n gondii (day 8) and HDI caused a consistent shift from &gt;95% Gram + Firmicutes to &gt;95% Gram - Proteobacteria.\n\n This was accompanied by reduced microbial diversity and mucosal invasion by adherent and invasive E.\n\n coli, mirroring the dysbiosis of ileal CD.\n\n In contrast, dysbiosis and bacterial invasion did not develop in mice with mild ileitis induced by Giardia muris.\n\n Superimposition of genetic susceptibility and T.\n\n Gondii infection revealed greatest dysbiosis and bacterial invasion in the CD-susceptible genotype, NOD2?/?, and reduced dysbiosis in ileitis-resistant CCR2?/? mice.\n\n Abrogating inflammation with the CD therapeutic anti-TNF-?-mAb tempered dysbiosis and bacterial invasion.\n\n\nConclusions\nAcute ileitis induces dysbiosis and proliferation of mucosally invasive E.\n\n coli, irrespective of trigger and genotype.\n\n The identification of CCR2 as a target for therapeutic intervention, and discovery that host genotype and therapeutic blockade of inflammation impact the threshold and extent of ileal dysbiosis are of high relevance to developing effective therapies for CD.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3404971","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Melanie","surname":"Craven","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charlotte

Microbiome Changes in a Mouse Model of Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Injury and Intestinal Inflammation","abstract":"Background\nParenteral nutrition (PN) has been a life-saving treatment in infants intolerant of enteral feedings.\n\n However, PN is associated with liver injury (PN Associated Liver Injury: PNALI) in a significant number of PN-dependent infants.\n\n We have previously reported a novel PNALI mouse model in which PN infusion combined with intestinal injury results in liver injury.\n\n In this model, lipopolysaccharide activation of toll-like receptor 4 signaling, soy oil-derived plant sterols, and pro-inflammatory activation of Kupffer cells (KCs) played key roles.\n\n The objective of this study was to explore changes in the intestinal microbiome associated with PNALI.\n\n\nMethodology and Principal Findings\nMicrobiome analysis in the PNALI mouse identified specific alterations within colonic microbiota associated with PNALI and further association of these communities with the lipid composition of the PN solution.\n\n Intestinal inflammation or soy oil-based PN infusion alone (in the absence of enteral feeds) caused shifts within the gut microbiota.\n\n However, the combination resulted in accumulation of a specific taxon, Erysipelotrichaceae (23.8% vs.\n\n 1.7% in saline infused controls), in PNALI mice.\n\n Moreover, PNALI was markedly attenuated by enteral antibiotic treatment, which also was associated with significant reduction of Erysipelotrichaceae (0.6%) and a Gram-negative constituent, the S24-7 lineage of Bacteroidetes (53.5% in PNALI vs.\n\n 0.8%).\n\n Importantly, removal of soy oil based-lipid emulsion from the PN solution resulted in significant reduction of Erysipelotrichaceae as well as attenuation of PNALI.\n\n Finally, addition of soy-derived plant sterol (stigmasterol) to fish oil-based PN restored Erysipelotrichaceae abundance and PNALI.\n\n\nConclusions\nSoy oil-derived plant sterols and the associated specific bacterial groups in the colonic microbiota are associated with PNALI.\n\n Products from these bacteria may directly trigger activation of KCs and promote PNALI.\n\n Furthermore, the results indicate that lipid modification of PN solutions may alter specific intestinal bacterial species associated with PNALI, and thus suggest strategies for management of PNALI.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4203793","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"J.

Reduction of adh and hsdh genes was also seen in UC and T2DM patients, while an increase was observed in the CD population as compared to healthy controls.\n A further analysis of the bsh genes showed significant differences in the correlations of certain Firmicutes families with disease or healthy populations.\n From this observation we proceeded to analyse BSH protein sequences and identified BSH

carcinoma.\n Accumulating evidence has additionally associated intestinal bacteria with disease initiation and progression.\n In order to examine and analyze the composition of gut microbiota in the absence of confounding influences, we have established an animal model of 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon cancer.\n Using this model, we have performed pyrosequencing of the V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes in this study to determine the diversity and breadth of the intestinal microbial species.\n Our findings indicate that the microbial composition of the intestinal lumen differs significantly between control and tumor groups.\n The abundance of Firmicutes was elevated whereas the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Spirochetes was reduced in the lumen of CRC rats.\n Fusobacteria was not detected in any of the healthy rats and there was no significant difference in observed Proteobacteria species when comparing the bacterial communities between our two groups.\n Interestingly, the abundance of Proteobacteria was higher in CRC rats.\n At the genus level, Bacteroides exhibited a relatively higher abundance in CRC rats compared to controls (14.92% vs.\n 9.22%, p&lt;0.001).\n Meanwhile, Prevotella (55.22% vs.\n 26.19%), Lactobacillus (3.71% vs.\n 2.32%) and Treponema (3.04% vs.\n 2.43%), were found to be significantly more abundant in healthy rats than CRC rats (p&lt;0.001, respectively).\n We also demonstrate a significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria such as Roseburia and Eubacterium in the gut microbiota of CRC rats.\n Furthermore, a

been associated with influenza in children, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom September 2005 and April 2008, pediatric patients in Indonesia presenting with concurrent diarrhea and influenza-like illness were enrolled in a study to determine the frequency of influenza virus infection in young patients presenting with symptoms less commonly associated with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).\n\n Stool specimens and upper respiratory swabs were assayed for the presence of influenza virus.\n\n\nResults\nSeasonal influenza A or influenza B viral RNA was detected in 85 (11.6%) upper respiratory specimens and 21 (2.9%) of stool specimens.\n\n Viable influenza B virus was isolated from the stool specimen of one case.\n\n During the time of this study, human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus were common in the survey area.\n\n However, among 733 enrolled subjects, none had evidence of H5N1 virus infection.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe detection of influenza viral RNA and viable influenza virus from stool suggests that influenza virus may be localized in the gastrointestinal tract of children, may be associated with pediatric diarrhea and may serve as a potential mode of transmission during seasonal and epidemic influenza

function of such cells, however, has remained elusive.\n We now demonstrate that CD161+ CD4 T cells comprise a circulating and gut-resident T helper 17 (Th17) cell population.\n During Crohn's disease (CD), these CD161+ cells display an activated Th17 phenotype, as indicated by increased expression of interleukin (IL)-17, IL-22, and IL-23 receptor.\n CD161+ CD4 T cells from CD patients readily produce IL-17 and interferon ? upon stimulation with IL-23, whereas, in healthy subjects, priming by additional inflammatory stimuli such as IL-1? was required to enable IL-23–induced cytokine release.\n Circulating CD161+ Th17 cells are imprinted for gut homing, as indicated by high levels of CC chemokine receptor 6 and integrin ?7 expression.\n Supporting their colitogenic phenotype, CD161+ Th17 cells were found in increased numbers in the inflammatory infiltrate of CD lesions and induced expression of inflammatory mediators by intestinal cells.\n Our data identify CD161+ CD4 T

core gut microbiome in obese and lean twins","abstract":"id='P1'>The human distal gut harbors a vast ensemble of microbes (the microbiota) that provide us with important metabolic capabilities, including the ability to extract energy from otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides1–6.\n Studies of a small number of unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S rRNA genes6–8, yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut microbiome) remains obscure.\n Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is utilized and stored3–5.\n To address the question of how host genotype, environmental exposures, and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome, we have characterized the fecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers.\n Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes.\n The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person’s gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs.\n However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable ‘core microbiome’ at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage level.\n Obesity is associated with phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity, and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways.\n These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from this core are associated with different physiologic states (obese versus lean).\n","id":"PMC2677729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Peter

reported in adults, gastrointestinal symptoms have been associated with influenza in children, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom September 2005 and April 2008, pediatric patients in Indonesia presenting with concurrent diarrhea and influenza-like illness were enrolled in a study to determine the frequency of influenza virus infection in young patients presenting with symptoms less commonly associated with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).\n\n Stool specimens and upper respiratory swabs were assayed for the presence of influenza virus.\n\n\nResults\nSeasonal influenza A or influenza B viral RNA was detected in 85 (11.6%) upper respiratory specimens and 21 (2.9%) of stool specimens.\n\n Viable influenza B virus was isolated from the stool specimen of one case.\n\n During the time of this study, human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus were common in the survey area.\n\n However, among 733 enrolled subjects, none had evidence of H5N1 virus infection.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe detection of influenza viral RNA and viable influenza virus from stool suggests that influenza virus may be localized in the gastrointestinal tract of children, may be associated with pediatric diarrhea and may serve as a potential mode of transmission during seasonal and epidemic influenza

susceptibility to bacterial infections are poorly understood.\n In particular, it is unclear whether the host's response against the viral infection, independent of the injury caused by the virus, results in impairment of antibacterial host defense.\n Here, we sought to determine whether the induction of an “antiviral” immune state using various viral recognition receptor ligands was sufficient to result in decreased ability to combat common bacterial pathogens of the lung.\n Using a mouse model, animals were administered polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) or Toll-like 7 ligand (imiquimod or gardiquimod) intranasally, followed by intratracheal challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n We found that animals pre-exposed to poly I:C displayed impaired bacterial clearance and increased mortality.\n Poly I:C-exposed animals also had decreased ability to clear methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\n Furthermore, we showed that activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 and Retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG-I)/Cardif pathways, which recognize viral nucleic acids in the form of dsRNA, both contribute to poly I:C mediated impairment of bacterial clearance.\n Finally, we determined that poly I:C administration resulted in significant induction of type I interferons (IFNs), whereas the elimination of type I IFN signaling improved clearance and survival following secondary bacterial pneumonia.\n Collectively, these results indicate that in the lung, poly I:C administration is sufficient to impair pulmonary host defense against clinically important gram-positive bacterial pathogens, which appears to be mediated by type I IFNs.\n","id":"PMC3433467","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaoli","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wing

enteric pathogen","abstract":"The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against invading microorganisms by inducing a variety of inflammatory and antimicrobial responses.\n These responses are particularly important in the gastrointestinal tract, where the needs for efficient nutrient uptake and host defense collide.\n Many pathogens have evolved to specifically colonize the intestine, causing millions of cases of enteric infections a year.\n A paradigm of an enteric pathogen is Salmonella enterica, a gram-negative bacterium that causes a wide range of gastrointestinal and systemic diseases.\n Infections with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.\n typhimurium) lead to an acute intestinal inflammation in human and animal hosts, as a result of the bacterium invading the mucosa.\n A distinctive feature of Salmonella is that it has not only adapted to survive in a strong inflammatory environment, but it also uses this adaptation as a strategy to gain a growth advantage over the intestinal microbiota.\n We will use the model organism S.\n typhimurium to discuss the innate immune mechanisms employed by the mammalian gastrointestinal system and how the pathogen responds and subverts these mechanisms.\n In particular, we focus on the recognition of extra- and intra-cellular Salmonellae by germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors of the TLR and NLR families, and how Salmonella might profit from the activation of these receptors.\n","id":"PMC3370950","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Petr","surname":"Broz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maikke

We further demonstrate that IL-22 was coexpressed in vitro and in vivo with both IL-17A and IL-17F.\n To study a functional relationship among these cytokines, we examined the expression of antimicrobial peptides by primary keratinocytes treated with combinations of IL-22, IL-17A, and IL-17F.\n IL-22 in conjunction with IL-17A or IL-17F synergistically induced the expression of ?-defensin 2 and S100A9 and additively enhanced the expression of S100A7 and S100A8.

over a four-year period were monitored by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene using 454-based pyrosequencing and terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP).\n While the microbial communities of untreated control subjects were relatively stable over time, dramatic shifts were observed one week after antibiotic treatment with reduced bacterial diversity in all treated subjects in both locations.\n While the microbiota of the different subjects responded uniquely to the antibiotic treatment some general trends could be observed; such as a dramatic decline in Actinobacteria in both throat and feces immediately after treatment.\n Although the diversity of the microbiota subsequently recovered to resemble the pre treatment states, the microbiota remained perturbed in some cases for up to four years post treatment.\n In addition, four years after treatment high levels of the macrolide resistance gene erm(B) were found, indicating that antibiotic resistance, once selected for,

studies published between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality

least 3·4 (2·8–4·3) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission.\n\n We estimated that 66?000–199?000 children younger than 5 years died from

morbidity and mortality, especially in high-risk populations such as infants, elderly, and immunocompromised hosts.\n Given its high capacity to change antigenically, acquired immunity is often not effective to limit IFV infection and therefore vaccination must be constantly redesigned to achieve effective protection.\n Improvement of respiratory and systemic innate immune mechanisms has been proposed to reduce the incidence and severity of IFV disease.\n In the last decade, several research works have demonstrated that microbes with the capacity to modulate the mucosal immune system (immunobiotics) are a potential alternative to beneficially modulate the outcome of IFV infection.\n This review provides an update of the current status on the modulation of respiratory immunity by orally and nasally administered immunobiotics, and their beneficial impact on IFV clearance and inflammatory-mediated lung tissue damage.\n In particular, we describe the research of our group that investigated the influence of immunobiotics on inflammation–coagulation interactions during IFV infection.\n Studies have clearly demonstrated that hostile inflammation is accompanied by dysfunctional coagulation in respiratory IFV disease, and our investigations have proved that some immunobiotic strains are able to reduce viral disease severity through their capacity to modulate the

2, a Sensitive and Broadly Dynamic Non-Invasive Biomarker for Intestinal Inflammation","abstract":"Inflammation has classically been defined histopathologically, especially by the presence of immune cell infiltrates.\n However, more recent studies suggest a role for 'low-grade' inflammation in a variety of disorders ranging from metabolic syndrome to cancer, which is defined by modest elevations in pro-inflammatory gene expression.\n Consequently, there is a need for cost-effective, non-invasive biomarkers that, ideally, would have the sensitivity to detect low-grade inflammation and have a dynamic range broad enough to reflect classic robust intestinal inflammation.\n Herein, we report that, for assessment of intestinal inflammation, fecal lipocalin 2 (Lcn-2), measured by ELISA, serves this purpose.\n Specifically, using a well-characterized mouse model of DSS colitis, we observed that fecal Lcn-2 and intestinal expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1?, CXCL1, TNF?) are modestly but significantly induced by very low concentrations of DSS (0.25 and 0.5%), and become markedly elevated at higher concentrations of DSS (1.0 and 4.0%).\n As expected, careful histopathologic analysis noted only modest immune infiltrates at low DSS concentration and robust colitis at higher DSS concentrations.\n In accordance, increased levels of the neutrophil product myeloperoxidase (MPO) was only detected in mice given 1.0 and 4.0% DSS.\n In addition, fecal Lcn-2 marks the severity of spontaneous colitis development in IL-10 deficient mice.\n Unlike histopathology, MPO, and q-RT-PCR, the assay of fecal Lcn-2 requires only a stool sample, permits measurement over time, and can detect inflammation as early as 1 day following DSS administration.\n Thus, assay of fecal Lcn-2 by ELISA can function as a non-invasive, sensitive, dynamic, stable and cost-effective means to monitor intestinal inflammation in mice.\n","id":"PMC3434182","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Benoit","surname":"Chassaing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gayathri","surname":"Srinivasan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria

evidence for richness-driven, strain-independent murine enterotypes that show a striking resemblance to those in human, and which associate with calprotectin levels, a marker for intestinal

research, mice have become the model of choice for most studies in this emerging field.\n Mouse models allow perturbations in gut microbiota to be studied in a controlled experimental setup, and thus help in assessing causality of the complex host-microbiota interactions and in developing mechanistic hypotheses.\n However, pitfalls should be considered when translating gut microbiome research results from mouse models to humans.\n In this Special Article, we discuss the intrinsic similarities and differences that exist between the two systems, and compare the human and murine core gut microbiota based on a meta-analysis of currently available datasets.\n Finally, we discuss the external factors that influence the capability of mouse models to recapitulate the gut microbiota shifts

kynurenine levels as the most prominent changes in stressed mice.\n Restoring intestinal Lactobacillus levels was sufficient to improve the metabolic alterations and behavioral abnormalities.\n Mechanistically, we identified that Lactobacillus-derived reactive oxygen species may suppress host kynurenine metabolism, by inhibiting the expression of the metabolizing enzyme, IDO1, in the intestine.\n Moreover, maintaining elevated kynurenine levels during Lactobacillus supplementation diminished the treatment benefits.\n Collectively, our data provide a mechanistic scenario for how a

of Age, Caloric Restriction, and Influenza Infection on Mouse Gut Microbiome: An Exploratory Study of the Role of Age-Related Microbiome Changes on Influenza Responses","abstract":"Immunosenescence refers to age-related declines in the capacity to respond to infections such as influenza (flu).\n Caloric restriction represents a known strategy to slow many aging processes, including those involving the immune system.\n More recently, some changes in the microbiome have been described with aging, while the gut microbiome appears to influence responses to flu vaccination and infection.\n With these considerations in mind, we used a well-established mouse model of flu infection to explore the impact of flu infection, aging, and caloric restriction on the gut microbiome.\n Young, middle-aged, and aged caloric restricted (CR) and ad lib fed (AL) mice were examined after a sublethal flu infection.\n All mice lost 10–20% body weight and, as expected for these early time points, losses were similar at different ages and between diet groups.\n Cytokine and chemokine levels were also similar with the notable exception of IL-1?, which rose more than fivefold in aged AL mouse serum, while it remained unchanged in aged CR serum.\n Fecal microbiome phyla abundance profiles were similar in young, middle-aged, and aged AL mice at baseline and at 4?days post flu infection, while increases in Proteobacteria were evident at 7?days post flu infection in all three age groups.\n CR mice, compared to AL mice in each age group, had increased abundance of Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia at all time points.\n Interestingly, principal coordinate analysis determined that diet exerts a greater effect on the microbiome than age or flu infection.\n Percentage body weight loss correlated with the relative abundance of Proteobacteria regardless of age, suggesting flu pathogenicity is related to Proteobacteria abundance.\n Further, several microbial Operational Taxonomic Units from the Bacteroidetes phyla correlated with serum chemokine/cytokines regardless of both diet and age suggesting an interplay between flu-induced systemic inflammation and gut microbiota.\n These exploratory studies highlight the impact of caloric restriction on fecal microbiome in both young and aged animals, as well as the many complex relationships between flu responses and gut microbiota.\n Thus, these preliminary studies provide the necessary groundwork to examine how gut microbiota alterations may be leveraged to influence declining immune responses with aging.\n","id":"PMC5611400","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jenna

respiratory tract, yet infected individuals may also develop gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea.\n However, the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined.\n Using an influenza mouse model, we found that influenza pulmonary infection can significantly alter the intestinal microbiota profile through a mechanism dependent on type I interferons (IFN-Is).\n Notably, influenza-induced IFN-Is produced in the lungs promote the depletion of obligate anaerobic bacteria and the enrichment of Proteobacteria in the gut, leading to a “dysbiotic” microenvironment.\n Additionally, we provide evidence that IFN-Is induced in the lungs during influenza pulmonary infection inhibit the antimicrobial and inflammatory responses in the gut during Salmonella-induced colitis, further enhancing Salmonella intestinal colonization and systemic dissemination.\n Thus, our studies demonstrate a systemic role for IFN-Is in regulating the host immune response in the gut

some gut bacteria have the ability to forage on glycans provided by the mucus layer covering the GI tract.\n The O-glycan structures present in mucin are diverse and complex, consisting predominantly of core 1-4 mucin-type O-glycans containing ?- and ?- linked N-acetyl-galactosamine, galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine.\n These core structures are further elongated and frequently modified by fucose and sialic acid sugar residues via ?1,2/3/4 and ?2,3/6 linkages, respectively.\n The ability to metabolize these mucin O-linked oligosaccharides is likely to be a key factor in determining which bacterial species colonize the mucosal surface.\n Due to their proximity to the immune system, mucin-degrading bacteria are in a prime location to influence the host response.\n However, despite the growing number of bacterial genome sequences available from mucin degraders, our knowledge on the structural requirements for mucin degradation by gut bacteria remains fragmented.\n This is largely due to the limited number of functionally characterized enzymes and the lack of studies correlating the specificity of these enzymes with the ability of the strain to degrade and utilize mucin and

respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.\n One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses.\n Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV.\n This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework,

participate in the occurrence of metabolic disorders.\n\n Our recent data support the idea that a selective increase of Bifidobacterium spp.\n\n reduces the impact of high-fat diet-induced metabolic endotoxaemia and inflammatory disorders.\n\n Here, we hypothesised that prebiotic modulation of gut microbiota lowers intestinal permeability, by a mechanism involving glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) thereby improving inflammation and metabolic disorders during obesity and diabetes.\n\n\nMethods:\nStudy 1: ob/ob mice (Ob-CT) were treated with either prebiotic (Ob-Pre) or non-prebiotic carbohydrates as control (Ob-Cell).\n\n Study 2: Ob-CT and Ob-Pre mice were treated with GLP-2 antagonist or saline.\n\n Study 3: Ob-CT mice were treated with a GLP-2 agonist or saline.\n\n We assessed changes in the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, gut peptides, intestinal epithelial tight-junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin (qPCR and immunohistochemistry), hepatic and systemic inflammation.\n\n\nResults:\nPrebiotic-treated mice exhibited a lower plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines, and a decreased hepatic expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers.\n\n This decreased inflammatory tone was associated with a lower intestinal permeability and improved tight-junction integrity compared to controls.\n\n Prebiotic increased the endogenous intestinotrophic proglucagon-derived peptide (GLP-2) production whereas the GLP-2 antagonist abolished most of the prebiotic effects.\n\n Finally, pharmacological GLP-2 treatment decreased gut permeability, systemic and hepatic inflammatory phenotype associated with obesity to a similar extent as that observed following prebiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota.\n\n\nConclusion:\nWe found that a selective gut microbiota change controls and increases endogenous GLP-2 production, and consequently improves gut barrier functions by a GLP-2-dependent mechanism, contributing to the improvement of gut barrier functions during obesity and diabetes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2702831","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"P

about the short-term effects of antibiotic intake on the gut microbial community.\n Here we examined the load and composition of the fecal microbiota immediately after treatment in 21 patients, who

Analysis of Pyrosequencing and a Phylogenetic Microarray for Exploring Microbial Community Structures in the Human Distal Intestine","abstract":"Background\nVariations in the composition of the human intestinal microbiota are linked to diverse health conditions.\n\n High-throughput molecular technologies have recently elucidated microbial community structure at much higher resolution than was previously possible.\n\n Here we compare two such methods, pyrosequencing and a phylogenetic array, and evaluate classifications based on two variable 16S rRNA gene regions.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nOver 1.75 million amplicon sequences were generated from the V4 and V6 regions of 16S rRNA genes in bacterial DNA extracted from four fecal samples of elderly individuals.\n\n The phylotype richness, for individual samples, was 1,400–1,800 for V4 reads and 12,500 for V6 reads, and 5,200 unique phylotypes when combining V4 reads from all samples.\n\n The RDP-classifier was more efficient for the V4 than for the far less conserved and shorter V6 region, but differences in community structure also affected efficiency.\n\n Even when analyzing only 20% of the reads, the majority of the microbial diversity was captured in two samples tested.\n\n DNA from the four samples was hybridized against the Human Intestinal Tract (HIT) Chip, a phylogenetic microarray for community profiling.\n\n Comparison of clustering of genus counts from pyrosequencing and HITChip data revealed highly similar profiles.\n\n Furthermore, correlations of sequence abundance and hybridization signal intensities were very high for lower-order ranks, but lower at family-level, which was probably due to ambiguous taxonomic groupings.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe RDP-classifier consistently assigned most V4 sequences from human intestinal samples down to genus-level with good accuracy and speed.\n\n This is the deepest sequencing of single gastrointestinal samples reported to date, but microbial richness levels have still not leveled out.\n\n A majority of these diversities can also be captured with five times lower sampling-depth.\n\n HITChip hybridizations and resulting community profiles correlate well with pyrosequencing-based compositions, especially for lower-order ranks, indicating high robustness of both approaches.\n\n However, incompatible grouping schemes make exact comparison difficult.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2725325","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marcus

Increase Gut Metabolism and Antioxidant Proteins and Decrease Acute Phase Response and Necrotizing Enterocolitis in Preterm Neonates","abstract":"Background\nThe appropriate use of antibiotics for preterm infants, which are highly susceptible to develop necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), is not clear.\n\n While antibiotic therapy is commonly used in neonates with NEC symptoms and sepsis, it remains unknown how antibiotics may affect the intestine and NEC sensitivity.\n\n We hypothesized that broad-spectrum antibiotics, given immediately after preterm birth, would reduce NEC sensitivity and support intestinal protective mechanisms.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nPreterm pigs were treated with antibiotics for 5 d (oral and systemic doses of gentamycin, ampicillin and metrodinazole; AB group) and compared with untreated pigs.\n\n Only the untreated pigs showed evidence of NEC lesions and reduced digestive function, as indicated by lowered villus height and activity of brush border enzymes.\n\n In addition, 53 intestinal and 22 plasma proteins differed in expression between AB and untreated pigs.\n\n AB treatment increased the abundance of intestinal proteins related to carbohydrate and protein metabolism, actin filaments, iron homeostasis and antioxidants.\n\n Further, heat shock proteins and the complement system were affected suggesting that all these proteins were involved in the colonization-dependent early onset of NEC.\n\n In plasma, acute phase proteins (haptoglobin, complement proteins) decreased, while albumin, cleaved C3, ficolin and transferrin increased.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nDepressed bacterial colonization following AB treatment increases mucosal integrity and reduces bacteria-associated inflammatory responses in preterm neonates.\n\n The plasma proteins C3, ficolin, and transferrin are potential biomarkers of the colonization-dependent NEC progression in preterm neonates.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3441690","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pingping","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael

barrier by increasing the expression levels of genes involved in tight junction formation","abstract":"Background\nIntestinal barrier function is important for preserving health, as a compromised barrier allows antigen entry and can induce inflammatory diseases.\n\n Probiotic bacteria can play a role in enhancing intestinal barrier function; however, the mechanisms are not fully understood.\n\n Existing studies have focused on the ability of probiotics to prevent alterations to tight junctions in disease models, and have been restricted to a few tight junction bridging proteins.\n\n No studies have previously investigated the effect of probiotic bacteria on healthy intestinal epithelial cell genes involved in the whole tight junction signalling pathway, including those encoding for bridging, plaque and dual location tight junction proteins.\n\n Alteration of tight junction signalling in healthy humans is a potential mechanism that could lead to the strengthening of the intestinal barrier, resulting in limiting the ability of antigens to enter the body and potentially triggering undesirable immune responses.\n\n\nResults\nThe effect of Lactobacillus plantarum MB452 on tight junction integrity was determined by measuring trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) across Caco-2 cell layers.\n\n L.\n\n plantarum MB452 caused a dose-dependent TEER increase across Caco-2 cell monolayers compared to control medium.\n\n Gene expression was compared in Caco-2 cells untreated or treated with L.\n\n plantarum MB452 for 10 hours.\n\n Caco-2 cell RNA was hybridised to human oligonucleotide arrays.\n\n Data was analysed using linear models and differently expressed genes were examined using pathway analysis tools.\n\n Nineteen tight junction-related genes had altered expression levels in response to L.\n\n plantarum MB452 (modified-P &lt; 0.05, fold-change &gt; 1.2), including those encoding occludin and its associated plaque proteins that anchor it to the cytoskeleton.\n\n L.\n\n plantarum MB452 also caused changes in tubulin and proteasome gene expression levels which may be linked to intestinal barrier function.\n\n Caco-2 tight junctions were visualised by fluorescent microscopy of immuno-stained occludin, zona occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2 and cingulin.\n\n Caco-2 cells treated with L.\n\n plantarum MB452 had higher intensity fluorescence of each of the four tight junction proteins compared to untreated controls.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis research indicates that enhancing the expression of genes involved in tight junction signalling is a possible mechanism by which L.\n\n plantarum MB452 improves intestinal barrier function.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3004893","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rachel

inflammation and drive extra-intestinal immune-mediated diseases.\n\n Epithelial cells constitute the interface between gut microbiota and host tissue, and may regulate host responses to commensal enteric bacteria.\n\n Gnotobiotic animals represent a powerful approach to study bacterial-host interaction but are not readily accessible to the wide scientific community.\n\n We aimed at refining a protocol that in a robust manner would deplete the cultivable intestinal microbiota of conventionally raised mice and that would prove to have significant biologic validity.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nPreviously published protocols for depleting mice of their intestinal microbiota by administering broad-spectrum antibiotics in drinking water were difficult to reproduce.\n\n We show that twice daily delivery of antibiotics by gavage depleted mice of their cultivable fecal microbiota and reduced the fecal bacterial DNA load by 400 fold while ensuring the animals' health.\n\n Mice subjected to the protocol for 17 days displayed enlarged ceca, reduced Peyer's patches and small spleens.\n\n Antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the expression of antimicrobial factors to a level similar to that of germ-free mice and altered the expression of 517 genes in total in the colonic epithelium.\n\n Genes involved in cell cycle were significantly altered concomitant with reduced epithelial proliferative activity in situ assessed by Ki-67 expression, suggesting that commensal microbiota drives cellular proliferation in colonic epithelium.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe present a robust protocol for depleting conventionally raised mice of their cultivatable intestinal microbiota with antibiotics by gavage and show that the biological effect of this depletion phenocopies physiological characteristics of germ-free mice.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3061881","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dag

Fecal samples were collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge.\n\n We compared fecal mycobiome compositions of patients with COVID-19 with those from 9 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 30 healthy individuals (controls).\n\n We assessed fecal mycobiome profiles throughout time of hospitalization until clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples.\n\n\nResults\nPatients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in their fecal mycobiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of Candia albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome configuration, at time of hospitalization.\n\n Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected.\n\n The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P &lt; .\n\n05).\n\n Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls.\n\n Two respiratory-associated fungal pathogens, A.\n\n flavus and Aspergillus niger, were detected in fecal samples from a subset of patients with COVID-19, even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples and resolution of respiratory symptoms.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn a pilot study, we found heterogeneous configurations of the fecal mycobiome, with enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus, during hospitalization of 30 patients with COVID-19 compared with controls.\n\n Unstable gut mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

been declared a global public health emergency.\n Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells.\n Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung.\n SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry.\n To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins.\n Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules.\n Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP.\n Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs.\n We also conducted “CellPhoneDB” analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues.\n We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.\n","id":"PMC7156119","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Furong","surname":"Qi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shen","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuye","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"First

outbreak is a major threat to human beings.\n\n Previous studies mainly focused on Wuhan and typical symptoms.\n\n We analysed 74 confirmed COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms in the Zhejiang province to determine epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics.\n\n\nDesign\nCOVID-19 hospital patients were admitted in the Zhejiang province from 17 January 2020 to 8 February 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome data of patients with GI symptoms were analysed using multivariate analysis for risk of severe/critical type.\n\n Bioinformatics were used to analyse features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province.\n\n\nResults\nAmong enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4%) presented with at least one GI symptom (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-day incubation period and 10.8% had pre-existing liver disease.\n\n Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 17 (22.97%) and 23 (31.08%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without GI symptoms, 47 (8.14%) and 118 (20.45%).\n\n Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 29 (39.19%), 23 (31.08%), 8 (10.81%) and 16 (21.62%) had significantly higher rates of fever &gt;38.5°C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, respectively.\n\n Low-dose glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 14.86% and 41.89% of patients, respectively.\n\n Sputum production and increased lactate dehydrogenase/glucose levels were risk factors for severe/critical type.\n\n Bioinformatics showed sequence mutation of SARS-CoV-2 with m6A methylation and changed binding capacity with ACE2.\nConclusion\nWe report COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms with novel features outside

(COVID-19) in December 2019, various digestive symptoms have been frequently reported in patients infected with the virus.\n\n In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms.\n\n\nMETHODS:\nIn this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment.\n\n Data were followed up until March 18, 2020.\nRESULTS:\nIn the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed.\n\n The average age was 52.9 years (SD ± 16), including 107 men and 97 women.\n\n Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases).\n\n If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.\n\n Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days).\n\n In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms.\n\n As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced.\n\n Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms.\n\n\nDISCUSSION:\nWe found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels.\n\n Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms.\n\n However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7172492","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mi","surname":"Mu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pengcheng","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Runsheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junhong","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pibao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Baoguang","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xun","surname":"Niu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rongyu","surname":"Ping","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yingzhen","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianzhi","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guogang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qinyong","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Study quality assessment tools","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1093/cid/ciaa272","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Features of 69 Cases with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nFrom December 2019 to February 2020, 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a serious outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.\n\n Related clinical features are needed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan between January 16 to January 29, 2020.

shortness of breath, and sore throat.\n\n However, digestive symptoms also occur in patients with COVID-19 and are often described in outpatients with less severe disease.\n\n In this study, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms and mild disease severity.\n\n\nMETHODS:\nWe identified COVID-19 patients with mild disease and one or more digestive symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), with or without respiratory symptoms, and compared them with a group presenting solely with respiratory symptoms.\n\n We followed up patients clinically until they tested negative for COVID-19 on at least 2 sequential respiratory tract specimens collected ?24 hours apart.\n\n We then compared the clinical features between those with digestive symptoms and those with respiratory symptoms.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nThere were 206 patients with low severity COVID-19, including 48 presenting with a digestive symptom alone, 69 with both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 with respiratory symptoms alone.\n\n Between the 2 groups with digestive symptoms, 67 presented with diarrhea, of whom 19.4% experienced diarrhea as the first symptom in their illness course.\n\n The diarrhea lasted from 1 to 14 days, with an average duration of 5.4 ± 3.1 days and a frequency of 4.3 ± 2.2 bowel movements per day.\n\n Concurrent fever was found in 62.4% of patients with a digestive symptom.\n\n Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those with respiratory symptoms (16.0 ± 7.7 vs 11.6 ± 5.1 days, P &lt; 0.001).\n\n Nevertheless, patients with digestive symptoms had a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance (P &lt; 0.001) and were more likely to be fecal virus positive (73.3% vs 14.3%, P = 0.033) than those with respiratory symptoms.\n\n\nDISCUSSION:\nWe describe a unique subgroup of COVID-19 patients with mild disease severity marked by the presence of digestive symptoms.\n\n These patients are more likely to test positive for viral RNA in stool, to have a longer delay before viral clearance, and to experience delayed diagnosis compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7172493","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaoqun","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caihan","surname":"Duan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shengyan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Brennan","surname":"Spiegel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huiying","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weijun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rong","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhen","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaohua","surname":"Hou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001282","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally.\n\n Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0–16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China.\n\n We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 8·3 [SD 3·5] years) were identified to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures.\n\n 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]).\n\n Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]).\n\n Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38·5°C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37·5–38·5°C.\n\n Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]).\n\n Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB.\n\n All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir–ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation.\n\n Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days.\n\n By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAlthough all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.\n\n\nFunding\nNingbo Clinical Research Center for Children's Health and Diseases, Ningbo Reproductive Medicine Centre, and Key Scientific and Technological Innovation

associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.27.20029009","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

Lung and Gastric Microbiotas in Healthy Individuals","abstract":"No studies have examined the relationships between bacterial communities along sites of the upper aerodigestive tract of an individual subject.\n Our objective was to perform an intrasubject and intersite analysis to determine the contributions of two upper mucosal sites (mouth and nose) as source communities for the bacterial microbiome of lower sites (lungs and stomach).\n Oral wash, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, nasal swab, and gastric aspirate samples were collected from 28 healthy subjects.\n Extensive analysis of controls and serial intrasubject BAL fluid samples demonstrated that sampling of the lungs by bronchoscopy was not confounded by oral microbiome contamination.\n By quantitative PCR, the oral cavity and stomach contained the highest bacterial signal levels and the nasal cavity and lungs contained much lower levels.\n Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries generated from these samples showed that the oral and gastric compartments had the greatest species richness, which was significantly greater in both than the richness measured in the lungs and nasal cavity.\n The bacterial communities of the lungs were significantly different from those of the mouth, nose, and stomach, while the greatest similarity was between the oral and gastric communities.\n However, the bacterial communities of healthy lungs shared significant membership with the mouth, but not the nose, and marked subject-subject variation was noted.\n In summary, microbial immigration from the oral cavity appears to be the significant source of the lung microbiome during health, but unlike the stomach, the lungs exhibit evidence of selective elimination of Prevotella bacteria derived from the upper airways.\n","id":"PMC4358017","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Christine M.","surname":"Bassis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John

nasal microbiota in health and disease: variation within and between subjects","abstract":"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects approximately 5% of the adult population in Western societies and severely reduces the patient’s quality of life.\n The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of this condition has not yet been established with certainty.\n However, recent reports of bacterial and fungal biofilms in CRS highlight a potential role for these microorganisms.\n In this study, 16S rRNA gene-targeted amplicon pyrosequencing and qPCR were used to determine the composition and abundance, respectively, of the sinus microbiota within 9 patients with CRS and 6 healthy individuals.\n Within-patient variability was also investigated by sampling from anterior nares, inferior turbinate, and middle meatus on each side of the sinuses.\n Our results indicate that more of the variation in bacterial composition can be explained by inter-personal differences, rather than sampling location or even disease status.\n In addition, bacterial community diversity was significantly lower in CRS samples compared to those from healthy subjects, whereas bacterial load was not associated with disease status.\n Although members of the genera Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus were prevalent in the majority of samples (including healthy subjects), the large amount of variation observed between individuals, particularly within the CRS cohort, suggests that an imbalance or dysbiosis in community structure could be the driving force behind the disease.\n Ultimately, understanding the causes of variation within the sinus microbiota may lead to more personalized treatment options for CRS.\n","id":"PMC4345913","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kristi","surname":"Biswas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Hoggard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ravi","surname":"Jain","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael

inflammation and sinus microbiome dysbiosis.\n\n The basis of this heterogeneity is poorly understood.\n\n We sought to address the hypothesis that a limited number of compositionally distinct pathogenic bacterial microbiota exist in CRS patients and invoke discrete immune responses and clinical phenotypes in CRS patients.\n\n\nResults\nSinus brushings from patients with CRS (n?=?59) and healthy individuals (n?=?10) collected during endoscopic sinus surgery were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, predicted metagenomics, and RNA profiling of the mucosal immune response.\n\n We show that CRS patients cluster into distinct sub-groups (DSI-III), each defined by specific pattern of bacterial co-colonization (permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA); p?=?0.001, r\n2?=?0.318).\n\n Each sub-group was typically dominated by a pathogenic family: Streptococcaceae (DSI), Pseudomonadaceae (DSII), Corynebacteriaceae [DSIII(a)], or Staphylococcaceae [DSIII(b)].\n\n Each pathogenic microbiota was predicted to be functionally distinct (PERMANOVA; p?=?0.005, r\n2?=?0.217) and encode uniquely enriched gene pathways including ansamycin biosynthesis (DSI), tryptophan metabolism (DSII), two-component response [DSIII(b)], and the PPAR-? signaling pathway [DSIII(a)].\n\n Each is also associated with significantly distinct host immune responses; DSI, II, and III(b) invoked a variety of pro-inflammatory, TH1 responses, while DSIII(a), which exhibited significantly increased incidence of nasal polyps (Fisher’s exact; p?=?0.034, relative risk?=?2.16), primarily induced IL-5 expression (Kruskal Wallis; q?=?0.045).\n\n\nConclusions\nA large proportion of CRS patient heterogeneity may be explained by the composition of their sinus bacterial microbiota and related host immune response—features which may inform strategies for tailored therapy in this patient population.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version

<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> quinolone signal production in LasR-defective <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strains","abstract":"Candida albicans has been previously shown to stimulate the production of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phenazine toxins in dual-species colony biofilms.\n Here, we report that P.\n aeruginosa lasR mutants, which lack the master quorum sensing system regulator, regain the ability to produce quorum-sensing-regulated phenazines when cultured with C.\n albicans.\n Farnesol, a signalling molecule produced by C.\n albicans, was sufficient to stimulate phenazine production in LasR? laboratory strains and clinical isolates.\n P.\n aeruginosa ?lasR mutants are defective in production of the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) due to their inability to properly induce pqsH, which encodes the enzyme necessary for the last step in PQS biosynthesis.\n We show that expression of pqsH in a ?lasR strain was sufficient to restore PQS production, and that farnesol restored pqsH expression in ?lasR mutants.\n The farnesol-mediated increase in pqsH required RhlR, a transcriptional regulator downstream of LasR, and farnesol led to higher levels of N-butyryl-homoserine lactone, the small molecule activator of RhlR.\n Farnesol promotes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a variety of species.\n Because the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine suppressed farnesol-induced RhlR activity in LasR? strains, and hydrogen peroxide was sufficient to restore PQS production in las mutants, we propose that ROS are responsible for the activation of downstream portions of this quorum sensing pathway.\n LasR mutants frequently arise in the lungs of patients chronically infected with P.\n aeruginosa.\n The finding that C.\n albicans, farnesol or ROS stimulate virulence factor production in lasR strains provides new insight into the virulence potential of these strains.\n","id":"PMC3068698","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carla","surname":"Cugini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Diana

Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics, and early microbial exposure have all been implicated.\n Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analyzed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats to date.\n We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat’s signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals.\n The project encountered an estimated 81–99% of the genera, enzyme families, and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome.\n Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata.\n These results thus delineate the

the Bacterial Microbiota of the Human Nostril and Oropharynx","abstract":"The nose and throat are important sites of pathogen colonization, yet the microbiota of both is relatively unexplored by culture-independent approaches.\n We examined the bacterial microbiota of the nostril and posterior wall of the oropharynx from seven healthy adults using two culture-independent methods, a 16S rRNA gene microarray (PhyloChip) and 16S rRNA gene clone libraries.\n While the bacterial microbiota of the oropharynx was richer than that of the nostril, the oropharyngeal microbiota varied less among participants than did nostril microbiota.\n A few phyla accounted for the majority of the bacteria detected at each site: Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in the nostril and Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in the oropharynx.\n Compared to culture-independent surveys of microbiota from other body sites, the microbiota of the nostril and oropharynx show distinct phylum-level distribution patterns, supporting niche-specific colonization at discrete anatomical sites.\n In the nostril, the distribution of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes was reminiscent of that of skin, though Proteobacteria were much less prevalent.\n The distribution of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in the oropharynx was most similar to that in saliva, with more Proteobacteria than in the distal esophagus or mouth.\n While Firmicutes were prevalent at both sites, distinct families within this phylum dominated numerically in each.\n At both sites there was an inverse correlation between the prevalences of Firmicutes and another phylum: in the oropharynx, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and in the nostril, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria.\n In the nostril, this inverse correlation existed between the Firmicutes family Staphylococcaceae and Actinobacteria families, suggesting potential antagonism between these groups.\n","id":"PMC2925076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Katherine

expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world.\n Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians.\n In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable.\n In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial.\n From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial sequence data.\n Although metagenomics is a relative newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an explosion in computational methods applied to metagenomic-based research.\n It is therefore not within the scope of this article to provide an exhaustive review.\n Rather, we provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the current computational requirements presented by metagenomics, and review the recent progress made.\n We also note whether there is software that implements any of the methods presented here, and briefly review its utility.\n Nevertheless, it would be useful if readers of this article would avail themselves of the comment section provided by this journal, and relate their own experiences.\n Finally, the last section of this article provides a few representative studies illustrating different facets of recent scientific discoveries made using

adults sampled at 15 to 18 body sites up to three times, which to date, have generated 5,177 microbial taxonomic profiles from 16S rRNA genes and over 3.5 Tb of metagenomic sequence.\n In parallel, approximately 800 human-associated reference genomes have been sequenced.\n Collectively, these data represent the largest resource to date describing the abundance and variety of the human microbiome, while providing a platform for current and future studies.\n","id":"PMC3377744","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Barbara

habitats such as the gut, skin, and vagina.\n Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics, and early microbial exposure have all been implicated.\n Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analyzed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats to date.\n We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat’s signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals.\n The project encountered an estimated 81–99% of the genera, enzyme families, and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome.\n Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata.\n These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology, and translational applications of the human

metagenomics: a reproducible protocol for virome analysis","abstract":"A major limitation for better understanding the role of the human gut virome in health and disease is the lack of validated methods that allow high throughput virome analysis.\n To overcome this, we evaluated the quantitative effect of homogenisation, centrifugation, filtration, chloroform treatment and random amplification on a mock-virome (containing nine highly diverse viruses) and a bacterial mock-community (containing four faecal bacterial species) using quantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n This resulted in an optimised protocol that was able to recover all viruses present in the mock-virome and strongly alters the ratio of viral versus bacterial and 16S rRNA genetic material in favour of viruses (from 43.2% to 96.7% viral reads and from 47.6% to 0.19% bacterial reads).\n Furthermore, our study indicated that most of the currently used virome protocols, using small filter pores and/or stringent centrifugation conditions may have largely overlooked large viruses present in viromes.\n We propose NetoVIR (Novel enrichment technique of VIRomes), which allows for a fast, reproducible and high throughput sample preparation for viral metagenomics studies, introducing minimal bias.\n This procedure is optimised mainly for faecal samples, but with appropriate concentration steps can also be used for other sample types with lower initial viral loads.\n","id":"PMC4642273","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nádia","surname":"Conceição-Neto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Zeller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hanne","surname":"Lefrère","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pieter","surname":"De

Proton Release Amplicon Sequencing","abstract":"Next generation sequencing technology has revolutionised microbiology by allowing concurrent analysis of whole microbial communities.\n Here we developed and verified similar methods for the analysis of fungal communities using a proton release sequencing platform with the ability to sequence reads of up to 400 bp in length at significant depth.\n This read length permits the sequencing of amplicons from commonly used fungal identification regions and thereby taxonomic classification.\n Using the 400 bp sequencing capability, we have sequenced amplicons from the ITS1, ITS2 and LSU fungal regions to a depth of approximately 700,000 raw reads per sample.\n Representative operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were chosen by the USEARCH algorithm, and identified taxonomically through nucleotide blast (BLASTn).\n Combination of this sequencing technology with the bioinformatics pipeline allowed species recognition in two controlled fungal spore populations containing members of known identity and concentration.\n Each species included within the two controlled populations was found to correspond to a representative OTU, and these OTUs were found to be highly accurate representations of true biological sequences.\n However, the absolute number of reads attributed to each OTU differed among species.\n The majority of species were represented by an OTU derived from all three genomic regions although in some cases, species were only represented in two of the regions due to the absence of conserved primer binding sites or due to sequence composition.\n It is apparent from our data that proton release sequencing technologies can deliver a qualitative assessment of the fungal members comprising a sample.\n The fact that some fungi cannot be amplified by specific “conserved” primer pairs confirms our recommendation that a multi-region approach be taken for other amplicon-based metagenomic studies.\n","id":"PMC3984086","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniel P.","surname":"Tonge","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Catherine

comparative benchmarking analysis against three popular metagenomic algorithms on an Illumina human gut dataset revealed Genometa to attribute the most reads to bacteria at species level (i.\n\ne.\n\n including all strains of that species) and demonstrate similar or better accuracy than the other programs.\n\n Lastly, speed was demonstrated to be many times that of BLAST due to the use of modern short read aligners.\n\n Our method is highly accurate if bacteria in the sample are represented by genomes in the reference sequence but cannot find species absent from the reference.\n\n This method is one of the most user-friendly and resource efficient approaches and is thus feasible for rapidly analysing millions of short reads on a personal computer.\n\n\nAvailability\nThe Genometa program, a step by step tutorial and Java source code are freely available from http://genomics1.mh-hannover.\n\nde/genometa/ and on http://code.\n\ngoogle.\n\ncom/p/genometa/.\n\n This program has been tested on Ubuntu Linux and Windows XP/7.\n","id":"PMC3424124","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Colin

rDNA PCR for archaea and bacteria to examine the microbiota of normal and psoriatic skin.\n From 6 patients, 19 cutaneous samples (13 from diseased skin and 6 from normal skin) were obtained.\n Extracted DNA was subjected to the broad range PCR, and 1,925 cloned products were compared with 2,038 products previously reported from healthy persons.\n Using 98% sequence identity as a species boundary, 1,841 (95.6%) clones were similar to known bacterial 16S rDNA, representing 6 phyla, 86 genera, or 189 species-level operational taxonomic unit (SLOTU); 84 (4.4%) clones with &lt;98% identity probably represented novel species.\n The most abundant and diverse phylum populating the psoriatic lesions was Firmicutes (46.2%), significantly (P&lt;0.001) overrepresented, compared to the samples from uninvolved skin of the patients (39.0%) and healthy persons (24.4%).\n In contrast, Actinobacteria, the most prevalent and diverse phylum in normal skin samples from both healthy persons

human distal gut harbors a vast ensemble of microbes (the microbiota) that provide us with important metabolic capabilities, including the ability to extract energy from otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides1–6.\n Studies of a small number of unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S rRNA genes6–8, yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut microbiome) remains obscure.\n Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is utilized and stored3–5.\n To address the question of how host genotype, environmental exposures, and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome, we have characterized the fecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers.\n Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes.\n The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person’s gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs.\n However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable ‘core microbiome’ at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage level.\n Obesity is associated with phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity, and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways.\n These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from this core are associated with different physiologic states (obese versus lean).\n","id":"PMC2677729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Peter

environmental samples at an unprecedented resolution.\n An issue common to many studies is the definition of what fractions of a data set should be considered as rare or dominant.\n Yet this question has neither been satisfactorily addressed, nor is the impact of such definition on data set structure and interpretation been fully evaluated.\n Here we propose a strategy, MultiCoLA (Multivariate Cutoff Level Analysis), to systematically assess the impact of various abundance or rarity cutoff levels on the resulting data set structure and on the consistency of the further ecological interpretation.\n We applied MultiCoLA to a 454 massively parallel tag sequencing data set of V6 ribosomal sequences from marine microbes in temperate coastal sands.\n Consistent ecological patterns were maintained after removing up to 35–40% rare sequences and similar patterns of beta diversity were observed after denoising the data set by using a preclustering algorithm of 454 flowgrams.\n This example validates the importance of exploring the impact of the definition of rarity in large community data sets.\n Future applications can be foreseen for data sets from different types of habitats,

for Interpretation of Genomes (FIG) launched the Project to Annotate 1000 Genomes.\n The project is built around the principle that the key to improved accuracy in high-throughput annotation technology is to have experts annotate single subsystems over the complete collection of genomes, rather than having an annotation expert attempt to annotate all of the genes in a single genome.\n Using the subsystems approach, all of the genes implementing the subsystem are analyzed by an expert in that subsystem.\n An annotation environment was created where populated subsystems are curated and projected to new genomes.\n A portable notion of a populated subsystem was defined, and tools developed for exchanging and curating these objects.\n Tools were also developed to resolve conflicts between populated subsystems.\n The SEED is the first annotation environment that supports this model of annotation.\n Here, we describe the subsystem approach, and offer the first release of our growing library of populated subsystems.\n The initial release of data includes 180?177 distinct proteins with 2133 distinct functional roles.\n This data comes from 173 subsystems and 383 different

physiology.\n To identify the genomic features common to all human gut microbiomes as well as those variable among them, we performed a large-scale comparative metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from 13 healthy individuals of various ages, including unweaned infants.\n We found that, while the gut microbiota from unweaned infants were simple and showed a high inter-individual variation in taxonomic and gene composition, those from adults and weaned children were more complex but showed a high functional uniformity regardless of age or sex.\n In searching for the genes over-represented in gut microbiomes, we identified 237 gene families commonly enriched in adult-type and 136 families in infant-type microbiomes, with a small overlap.\n An analysis of their predicted functions revealed various strategies employed by each type of microbiota to adapt to its intestinal environment, suggesting that these gene sets encode the core functions of adult and infant-type gut microbiota.\n By analysing the orphan genes, 647 new gene families were identified to be exclusively present in human intestinal microbiomes.\n In addition, we discovered a conjugative transposon family explosively amplified in human gut microbiomes, which strongly suggests that the intestine is a ‘hot spot’ for horizontal gene transfer between

expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world.\n Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians.\n In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable.\n In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial.\n From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in

adjustment.\n\n However, even with the false discovery rate (FDR) control approach, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) may still fall short of discovering any true positive gene, particularly when it has a relatively small sample size.\n\n\nFindings\nTo counteract such a harsh multiple-testing penalty, in this report, we incorporate findings from previous linkage and association studies to re-analyze a GWAS on age-related macular degeneration.\n\n While previous Bonferroni correction and the traditional FDR approach detected only one significant SNP (rs380390), here we have been able to detect seven significant SNPs with an easy-to-implement prioritized subset analysis (PSA) with the overall FDR controlled at 0.05. These include SNPs within three genes: CFH, CFHR4, and SGCD.\n\n\nConclusions\nBased on the success of this example, we advocate using the simple method of PSA to facilitate discoveries in future

colitis and Crohn's disease is difficult due to the ambiguity surrounding their precise aetiology.\n Infectious gastrointestinal diseases, such as various types of diarrheal disease are also becoming increasingly difficult to treat due to the increasing dissemination of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms and the emergence of the so-called 'superbugs'.\n Taking into consideration these problems, the need for novel therapeutics is essential.\n Although described for over a century probiotics have only been extensively researched in recent years.\n Their use in the treatment and prevention of disease, particularly gastrointestinal disease, has yielded many successful results, some of which we outline in this review.\n Although promising, many probiotics are hindered by inherent physiological and technological weaknesses and often the most clinically promising strains are unusable.\n Consequently we discuss various strategies whereby probiotics may be engineered to create designer probiotics.\n Such innovative approaches include; a receptor mimicry strategy to create probiotics that target specific pathogens and toxins, a patho-biotechnology approach using pathogen-derived genes to create more robust probiotic stains with increased host and processing-associated stress tolerance profiles and meta-biotechnology, whereby, functional metagenomics may be used to identify novel genes from diverse and vastly unexplored environments, such as the human gut, for use in biotechnology and

meaningful multiple sequence alignment.\n The most commonly used aligners have varying alignment quality and speed, tend to depend on a specific reference alignment, or lack a complete description of the underlying algorithm.\n The purpose of this study was to create and validate an aligner with the goal of quickly generating a high quality alignment and having the flexibility to use any reference alignment.\n Using the simple nearest alignment space termination algorithm, the resulting aligner operates in linear time, requires a small memory footprint, and generates a high quality alignment.\n In addition, the alignments generated for variable regions were of as high a quality as the alignment of full-length sequences.\n As implemented, the method was able to align 18 full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences and 58 V2 region sequences per second to the 50,000-column SILVA reference alignment.\n Most importantly, the resulting alignments were of a quality equal to SILVA-generated alignments.\n The aligner described in this study will enable scientists to rapidly generate robust multiple sequences alignments that are implicitly based upon the predicted secondary structure of the 16S rRNA molecule.\n Furthermore, because the implementation is not connected to a specific database it is easy to generalize the method to reference alignments for any DNA sequence.\n","id":"PMC2788221","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Patrick

This paper describes the methods, assumptions, input data, and results.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nRelatively simple models were used to project future health trends under three scenarios—baseline, optimistic, and pessimistic—based largely on projections of economic and social development, and using the historically observed relationships of these with cause-specific mortality rates.\n\n Data inputs have been updated to take account of the greater availability of death registration data and the latest available projections for HIV/AIDS, income, human capital, tobacco smoking, body mass index, and other inputs.\n\n In all three scenarios there is a dramatic shift in the distribution of deaths from younger to older ages and from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional causes to noncommunicable disease causes.\n\n The risk of death for children younger than 5 y is projected to fall by nearly 50% in the baseline scenario between 2002 and 2030. The proportion of deaths due to noncommunicable disease is projected to rise from 59% in 2002 to 69% in 2030. Global HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to rise from 2.8 million in 2002 to 6.5 million in 2030 under the baseline scenario, which assumes coverage with antiretroviral drugs reaches 80% by 2012. Under the optimistic scenario, which also assumes increased prevention activity, HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to drop to 3.7 million in 2030. Total tobacco-attributable deaths are projected to rise from 5.4 million in 2005 to 6.4 million in 2015 and 8.3 million in 2030 under our baseline scenario.\n\n Tobacco is projected to kill 50% more people in 2015 than HIV/AIDS, and to be responsible for 10% of all deaths globally.\n\n The three leading causes of burden of disease in 2030 are projected to include HIV/AIDS, unipolar depressive disorders, and ischaemic heart disease in the baseline and pessimistic scenarios.\n\n Road traffic accidents are the fourth leading cause in the baseline scenario, and the third leading cause ahead of ischaemic heart disease in the optimistic scenario.\n\n Under the baseline scenario, HIV/AIDS becomes the leading cause of burden of disease in middle- and low-income countries by 2015.\nConclusions\nThese projections represent a set of three visions of the future for population health, based on certain explicit assumptions.\n\n Despite the wide uncertainty ranges around future projections, they enable us to appreciate better the implications for health and health policy of currently observed trends, and the likely impact of fairly certain future trends, such as the ageing of the population, the continued spread of HIV/AIDS in many regions, and the continuation of the epidemiological transition in developing countries.\n\n The results depend strongly on the assumption that future mortality trends in poor countries will have a relationship to economic and social development similar to those that have occurred in the higher-income countries.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1664601","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Colin

particularly affects immunocompromised hosts.\n\n Recently, several studies have indicated a high incidence of IA in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.\n\n However, few data are available on the epidemiology and outcome of patients with IA in this setting.\n\n\nMethods\nAn observational study including all patients with a positive Aspergillus culture during ICU stay was performed in 30 ICUs in 8 countries.\n\n Cases were classified as proven IA, putative IA or Aspergillus colonization according to recently validated criteria.\n\n Demographic, microbiologic and diagnostic data were collected.\n\n Outcome was recorded 12 weeks after Aspergillus isolation.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 563 patients were included, of whom 266 were colonized (47%), 203 had putative IA (36%) and 94 had proven IA (17%).\n\n The lung was the most frequent site of infection (94%), and Aspergillus fumigatus the most commonly isolated species (92%).\n\n Patients with IA had higher incidences of cancer and organ transplantation than those with colonization.\n\n Compared with other patients, they were more frequently diagnosed with sepsis on ICU admission and more frequently received vasopressors and renal replacement therapy (RRT) during the ICU stay.\n\n Mortality was 38% among colonized patients, 67% in those with putative IA and 79% in those with proven IA (P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Independent risk factors for death among patients with IA included older age, history of bone marrow transplantation, and mechanical ventilation, RRT and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at diagnosis.\n\n\nConclusions\nIA among critically ill patients is associated with high mortality.\n\n Patients diagnosed with proven or putative IA had greater severity of illness and more frequently needed organ support than those with Aspergillus spp colonization.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4344741","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fabio

PIPA.\n\n\nMethods\nThis matched cohort study included critically ill patients with COPD from two university hospital intensive care units (ICUs).\n\n We studied the risk factors for PIPA as well as the impact of PIPA on short- and long-term outcomes.\n\n Whether PIPA was associated with a pattern of bacterial colonization and/or infection 6 months before and/or during ICU stay was assessed.\n\n In addition, antifungal strategies were reviewed.\n\n\nResults\nFifty cases of PIPA in critically ill patients with COPD in the ICU were matched with one hundred control patients with COPD.\n\n The ICU short- and the long-term (at 1 year) mortality were significantly increased in the PIPA group (p?&lt;?0.001 for all variables).\n\n PIPA was a strong independent risk factor for mortality in the ICU (odds ratio 7.44, 95 % confidence interval 2.93–18.93, p?&lt;?0.001) before vasopressor therapy, renal replacement therapy, and duration of mechanical ventilation.\n\n Before ICU admission, the

most frequently isolated species (59%).\n For proven cases, sensitivity of BDG/GM analysis was 57%/40%.\n Including all samples dating from –6 to +1 weeks from d0 increased sensitivities to 74%/51%.\n Sensitivity of BDG testing was as high as or higher than GM testing for all subgroups and time intervals analysed.\n BDG testing was less specific (90–93%) than GM testing (99–100%).\n Combining BDG

lung lesions, with or without fibrosis and those with aspergillomas or a diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis were excluded.\n\n Demographic, laboratory, and clinical data and radiologic findings were recorded.\n\n\nResults\nThirty-three patients with pulmonary nodules and diagnostic features of aspergillosis (histology and/or laboratory findings) were identified.\n\n Eighteen (54.5 %) were male, mean age 58 years (range 27–80 years).\n\n 19 (57.6 %) were former or current smokers.\n\n The median Charleston co-morbidity index was 3 (range 0–7).\n\n All complained of a least one of; dyspnoea, cough, haemoptysis, or weight loss.\n\n None reported fever.\n\n Ten patients (31 %) did not have an elevated Aspergillus IgG, and only 4 patients had elevated Aspergillus precipitins.\n\n Twelve patients (36 %) had a single nodule, six patients (18 %) had between 2 and 5 nodules, 2 (6 %) between 6 and 10 nodules and 13 (39 %) had more than 10 nodules.\n\n The mean size of the nodules was 21 mm, with a maximum size ranging between 5–50 mm.\n\n No nodules had cavitation radiographically.\n\n The upper lobes were most commonly involved.\n\n Histology was available for 18 patients and showed evidence of granulation tissue, fibrosis, and visualisation of fungal hyphae.\n\n\nConclusion\nPulmonary nodules are a less common manifestation of aspergillosis in immunocompetent

COPD, but it is unclear why it develops in a subset of patients.\n\n We hypothesized that sensitization to Aspergillus fumigatus (A fum) is associated with bronchiectasis in COPD and occurs more frequently in vitamin D-deficient patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThis observational study investigated sensitization to A fum in an outpatient clinical cohort of 300 COPD patients and 50 (ex-) smoking controls.\n\n Total IgE, A fum-specific IgE against the crude extract and against the recombinant antigens and A fum IgG were measured using ImmunoCAP fluoroenzyme immunoassay.\n\n Vitamin D was measured by radioimmunoassay, and computed tomography images of the lungs were scored using the modified Reiff score.\n\n\nResults\nSensitization to A fum occurred in 18% of COPD patients compared to 4% of controls (P=0.0110).\n\n In all, 31 COPD patients (10%) were sensitized to the crude extract and 24 patients (8%) had only IgE against recombinant antigens.\n\n A fum IgG levels were significantly higher in the COPD group (P=0.0473).\n\n Within COPD, A fum-sensitized patients were more often male (P=0.0293) and more often had bronchiectasis (P=0.0297).\n\n Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were more prevalent in historical sputum samples of A fum-sensitized COPD patients compared to A fum-non-sensitized COPD patients (P=0.0436).\n\n Vitamin D levels were comparable (P=0.2057).\n\n Multivariate analysis demonstrated that sensitization to recombinant f1 or f3 had a 2.8-fold increased risk for bronchiectasis (P=0.0030).\n\n\nConclusion\nThese results

obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) seems to increase.\n Approximately 1%–2% of overall fatal cases of IPA occur in COPD patients.\n The combination of factors such as lung immune imbalance, long-term corticosteroid use, increasing rate of bacterial exacerbations over time, and malnutrition are responsible for the emergence of IPA in these patients.\n The diagnosis of IPA is difficult to establish, which explains the delay in implementing accurate antifungal therapy and the high mortality rate.\n Persistent pneumonia nonresponsive to appropriate antibiotic treatment raises the concern of an invasive fungal infection.\n Definite diagnosis is obtained from tissue biopsy evidencing Aspergillus spp.\n on microscopic examination or in culture.\n Culture and microscopy of respiratory tract samples have a sensitivity and specificity of around 50%.\n Other diagnostic tools can be useful in documenting IPA: computed tomography (CT) scan, nonculture-based tests in serum and/or in bronchoalveolar lavage such as antibody/antigen tests for Aspergillus spp.\n More recent tools such as polymerase chain reaction or [1?3]-?-D-glucan have predictive values that need to be further investigated in COPD patients.\n Antifungal monotherapy using azole voriconazole is recommended as a first-line treatment of IPA.\n This review assesses the use of voriconazole in COPD

incomplete restoration of healthy growth remains a major problem1,2.\n The relationships between the type of nutritional intervention, the gut microbiota, and therapeutic responses are unclear.\n In the current study, bacterial species whose proportional representation define a healthy gut microbiota as it assembles during the first two postnatal years were identified by applying a machine-learning-based approach to 16S rRNA datasets generated from monthly fecal samples obtained from a birth-cohort of children, living in an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh, who exhibited consistently healthy growth.\n These age-discriminatory bacterial species were incorporated into a model that computes a ‘relative microbiota maturity index’ and ‘microbiota-for-age Z-score’ that compare development (defined here as maturation) of a child’s fecal microbiota relative to healthy children of similar chronologic age.\n The model was applied to twins and triplets (to test for associations of these indices with genetic and environmental factors including diarrhea), children with SAM enrolled in a randomized trial of two food interventions, and children with moderate acute malnutrition.\n Our results indicate that SAM is associated with significant relative microbiota immaturity that is only partially ameliorated following two widely used nutritional interventions.\n Immaturity is also evident in less severe forms of malnutrition and correlates with anthropometric measurements.\n Microbiota maturity indices provide a microbial measure of human postnatal development, a way of classifying malnourished states, and a parameter for judging therapeutic efficacy.\n More prolonged interventions with existing or new therapeutic foods and/or addition of gut

community also appears to encode a surprisingly rich functional repertoire that confers a range of attributes to their bacterial hosts, ranging from bacterial virulence and pathogenesis to maintaining host–microbiome stability and community resilience.\n Despite the significant advances in our understanding of the gut virome in recent years, it is clear that we remain in a period of discovery and revelation, as new methods and technologies begin to provide deeper understanding of the inherent ecological characteristics of this viral ecosystem.\n As our understanding increases, the nature of

including inbred homogeneity, tools for genetic manipulation, the ability to perform kinetic tissue analyses starting with the onset of disease, and tractable models.\n Comparably reductionist experiments are neither technically nor ethically possible in humans.\n Despite revealing many fundamental principals of immunology, there is growing concern that mice fail to capture relevant aspects of the human immune system, which may account for failures to translate disease treatments from bench to bedside1–8.\n Laboratory mice live in abnormally hygienic “specific pathogen free” (SPF) barrier facilities.\n Here we show that the standard practice of laboratory mouse husbandry has profound effects on the immune system and that environmental changes result in better recapitulation of features of adult humans.\n Laboratory mice lack effector-differentiated and mucosally distributed memory T cells, which more closely resembles neonatal than adult humans.\n These cell populations were present in free-living barn populations of feral mice, pet store mice with diverse microbial experience, and were induced in laboratory mice after co-housing with pet store mice, suggesting a role for environment.\n Consequences of altering mouse housing profoundly impacted the cellular composition of the innate and adaptive immune system and resulted in global changes in blood cell gene expression patterns that more closely aligned with immune signatures of adult humans rather than neonates, altered the mouse’s resistance to infection, and impacted T cell differentiation to a de novo viral infection.\n These data highlight the impact of environment on the basal immune state and response to infection and suggest that restoring physiological microbial exposure in laboratory mice could provide a relevant tool for modeling immunological events in free-living organisms, including humans.\n","id":"PMC4871315","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lalit K.","surname":"Beura","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sara

microbiota reveals dysbiosis and differences between inflamed and non-inflamed regions of the intestine in inflammatory bowel disease","abstract":"Background\nThe gut microbiota is thought to play a key role in the development of the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).\n\n Shifts in the composition of resident bacteria have been postulated to drive the chronic inflammation seen in both diseases (the 'dysbiosis' hypothesis).\n\n We therefore specifically sought to compare the mucosa-associated microbiota from both inflamed and non-inflamed sites of the colon in CD and UC patients to that from non-IBD controls and to detect disease-specific profiles.\n\n\nResults\nPaired mucosal biopsies of inflamed and non-inflamed intestinal tissue from 6 CD (n = 12) and 6 UC (n = 12) patients were compared to biopsies from 5 healthy controls (n = 5) by in-depth sequencing of over 10,000 near full-length bacterial 16S rRNA genes.\n\n The results indicate that mucosal microbial diversity is reduced in IBD, particularly in CD, and that the species composition is disturbed.\n\n Firmicutes were reduced in IBD samples and there were concurrent increases in Bacteroidetes, and in CD only, Enterobacteriaceae.\n\n There were also significant differences in microbial community structure between inflamed and non-inflamed mucosal sites.\n\n However, these differences varied greatly between individuals, meaning there was no obvious bacterial signature that was positively associated with the inflamed gut.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results may support the hypothesis that the overall dysbiosis observed in inflammatory bowel disease patients relative to non-IBD controls might to some extent be a result of the disturbed gut environment rather than the direct cause of disease.\n\n Nonetheless, the observed shifts in microbiota composition may be important factors in disease maintenance and severity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3032643","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alan

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

unexplained radiographic infiltrate, and laboratory-confirmed H7N9 virus infection.\n\n We recorded histories and results of haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations.\n\n We took throat and sputum samples, used RT-PCR to detect M, H7, and N9 genes, and cultured samples in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.\n\n We tested for co-infections and monitored serum concentrations of six cytokines and chemokines.\n\n We collected cloacal swabs from 86 birds from epidemiologically linked wet markets and inoculated embryonated chicken eggs with the samples.\n\n We identified and subtyped isolates by RT-PCR sequencing.\n\n RNA extraction, complementary DNA synthesis, and PCR sequencing were done for one human and one chicken isolate.\n\n We characterised and phylogenetically analysed the eight gene segments of the viruses in the patient's and the chicken's isolates, and constructed phylogenetic trees of H, N, PB2, and NS genes.\n\n\nFindings\nWe identified four patients (mean age 56 years), all of whom had contact with poultry 3–8 days before disease onset.\n\n They presented with fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics.\n\n Patients were leucopenic and lymphopenic, and had impaired liver or renal function, substantially increased serum cytokine or chemokine concentrations, and disseminated intravascular coagulation with disease progression.\n\n Two patients died.\n\n Sputum specimens were more likely to test positive for the H7N9 virus than were samples from throat swabs.\n\n The viral isolate from the patient was closely similar to that from an epidemiologically linked market chicken.\n\n All viral gene segments were of avian origin.\n\n The H7 of the isolated viruses was closest to that of the H7N3 virus from domestic ducks in Zhejiang, whereas the N9 was closest to that of the wild bird H7N9 virus in South Korea.\n\n We noted Gln226Leu and Gly186Val substitutions in human virus H7 (associated with increased affinity for ?-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors) and the PB2 Asp701Asn mutation (associated with mammalian adaptation).\n\n

to 30 FMT treatments.\n Viral particles were purified from donor and recipient stool samples and sequenced; the reads were then assembled into contigs corresponding to viral genomes or partial

appearing in a recipient sample.\n Reassuringly, none of these were viruses are known to replicate on human cells.\n Instead, viral contigs either scored as bacteriophage or could not be attributed taxonomically, suggestive of unstudied phage.\n The two most frequently transferred gene types were associated with temperate-phage replication.\n In addition, members of Siphoviridae, the group of typically temperate phages that includes phage lambda, were found to be transferred with significantly greater efficiency than other groups.\n On the basis of these findings, we propose that the

outnumbered fungi by &gt;3 orders of magnitude.\n Upon antibiotic treatment, bacteria dropped in abundance &gt;3 orders of magnitude, so that the predominant 16S sequences detected became transients

bacterial intestinal microbiota plays major roles in human physiology and IBDs.\n\n Although some data suggest a role of the fungal microbiota in IBD pathogenesis, the available data are scarce.\n\n The aim of our study was to characterise the faecal fungal microbiota in patients with IBD.\n\n\nDesign\nBacterial and fungal composition of the faecal microbiota of 235 patients with IBD and 38 healthy subjects (HS) was determined using 16S and ITS2 sequencing, respectively.\n\n The obtained sequences were analysed using the Qiime pipeline to assess composition and diversity.\n\n Bacterial and fungal taxa associated with clinical parameters were identified using multivariate association with linear models.\n\n Correlation between bacterial and fungal microbiota was investigated using Spearman's test and distance correlation.\n\n\nResults\nWe observed that fungal microbiota is skewed in IBD, with an increased Basidiomycota/Ascomycota ratio, a decreased proportion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and an increased proportion of Candida albicans compared with HS.\n\n We also identified disease-specific alterations in diversity, indicating that a Crohn's disease-specific gut environment may favour fungi at the expense of bacteria.\n\n The concomitant analysis of bacterial and fungal microbiota showed a dense and homogenous correlation network in HS but a dramatically unbalanced network in IBD, suggesting the existence of disease-specific inter-kingdom alterations.\n\n\nConclusions\nBesides bacterial dysbiosis, our study identifies a distinct fungal microbiota

continue to reveal novel species at a remarkable rate.\n Greengenes is a dedicated full-length 16S rRNA gene database that provides users with a curated taxonomy based on de novo tree inference.\n We developed a ‘taxonomy to tree' approach for transferring group names from an existing taxonomy to a tree topology, and used it to apply the Greengenes, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and cyanoDB (Cyanobacteria only) taxonomies to a de novo tree comprising 408?315 sequences.\n We also incorporated explicit rank information provided by the NCBI taxonomy to group names (by prefixing rank designations) for better user orientation and classification consistency.\n The resulting merged taxonomy improved the classification of 75% of the sequences by one or more ranks relative to the original NCBI taxonomy with the most pronounced improvements occurring in under-classified environmental sequences.\n We also assessed candidate phyla (divisions) currently defined by NCBI and present recommendations for consolidation of 34 redundantly named groups.\n All intermediate results from the pipeline, which includes tree inference, jackknifing and transfer of a donor taxonomy to a recipient tree (tax2tree) are available for download.\n The improved Greengenes taxonomy should provide important infrastructure for a wide range of megasequencing projects studying ecosystems on scales ranging from our own bodies (the Human Microbiome Project) to the entire planet (the Earth Microbiome Project).\n The implementation of the software can be obtained from

Penicillium.\n We demonstrate that the final two selected pan-Candida primer sets would not amplify Aspergillus DNA and could be used to differentiate eight medically important Candida pathogens in real-time PCR assays based on their melting profiles, with a sensitivity of detection as low as 10 fg of Candida genomic DNA.\n Moreover, we further evaluated and selected species-specific primer sets covering Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Candida dubliniensis and show that they had high sensitivity and specificity.\n These real-time PCR primer sets could potentially be assembled into a single PCR array for the rapid detection of Candida species in various clinical settings, such as corneal

coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

several studies have indicated a high incidence of IA in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.\n\n However, few data are available on the epidemiology and outcome of patients with IA in this setting.\n\n\nMethods\nAn observational study including all patients with a positive Aspergillus culture during ICU stay was performed in 30 ICUs in 8 countries.\n\n Cases were classified as proven IA, putative IA or Aspergillus colonization according to recently validated criteria.\n\n Demographic, microbiologic and diagnostic data were collected.\n\n Outcome was recorded 12 weeks after Aspergillus isolation.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 563 patients were included, of whom 266 were colonized (47%), 203 had putative IA (36%) and 94 had proven IA (17%).\n\n The lung was the most frequent site of infection (94%), and Aspergillus fumigatus the most commonly isolated species (92%).\n\n Patients with IA had higher incidences of cancer and organ transplantation than those with colonization.\n\n Compared with other patients, they were more frequently diagnosed with sepsis on ICU admission and more frequently received vasopressors and renal replacement therapy (RRT) during the ICU stay.\n\n Mortality was 38% among colonized patients, 67% in those with putative IA and 79% in those with proven IA (P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Independent risk factors for death among patients with

modified AspICU criteria was 13%.\n\n Most subgroup analyses showed ?50% mortality in IPA patients.\n\n Several predictors for IPA susceptibility were identified, including male sex, smoking history, chronic lung disease, influenza A (H1N1), severe conditions requiring supportive therapy, corticosteroid use before admission, solid organ transplant and haematological malignancy.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe IPA is common in individuals with severe influenza, and the prognosis is particularly poor.\n\n Influenza patients, especially those with high?risk factors, should be thoroughly screened for IPA.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9306612","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Changcheng","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qiyuan","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Qiyuan","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junbo","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Junbo","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liusheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Linling","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yaping","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nengming","surname":"Lin","email":"lnm1013@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Limin","surname":"Wang","email":"lnm1013@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Limin","surname":"Wang","email":"lnm1013@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Influenza:

Bats are known to be the primary animal reservoir for coronaviruses.\n However, in the past few decades, the virus has been able to mutate and adapt to infect humans, resulting in an animal-to-human species barrier jump.\n The emergence of a novel coronavirus poses a serious global public health threat and possibly carries the potential of causing a major pandemic outbreak in the naïve human population.\n The recent outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has infected over 36.5 million individuals and claimed over one million lives worldwide, as of 8 October 2020. The novel virus is rapidly spreading across China and has been transmitted to 213 other countries/territories across the globe.\n Researchers have reported that the virus is constantly evolving and

between 8.0 and 16.0 days.\n However, the time to CAPA diagnosis from intensive care unit (ICU) admission and IMV initiation ranged between 4.0–15.0 days and 3.0–8.0 days.\n The most common diagnostic criteria were the modified AspICU–Dutch/Belgian Mycosis Study Group and IAPA-Verweij et al.\n A total of 77.6% of patients had positive lower respiratory tract cultures, other fungal biomarkers of

COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) in severe COVID-19 patients varies between cohorts.\n We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcome of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a regional cohort of COVID-19 intensive care patients.\n Methods: We performed a regional, multicentre, retrospective cohort study in the intensive care units (ICUs) in North Brabant, The Netherlands.\n We included adult patients with rt-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), requiring mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n Demographics, clinical course, biomarker value, and treatment outcomes were compared between the groups with possible/probable CAPA from the main study centre and the regional centres, and without signs of CAPA from the main study centre as controls.\n The primary aim was to assess the regional impact of possible/probable CAPA in COVID-19 ICU patients, measured as all-cause mortality at 30 days after ICU admission.\n Secondary outcomes were risk factors for developing CAPA, based on underlying host factors and to identify the value of the mycological arguments for the diagnosing of CAPA.\n Results: Between 1 March and 30 April 2020, we included 123 patients with severe COVID-19: 29 patients (30.9%) in the main ICU with possible/probable CAPA, and 65 (69.1%) with no signs of CAPA; 29 patients in the regional ICUs with signs of CAPA.\n Patients’ characteristics and risk factors did not differ for CAPA and non-CAPA patients.\n Patients with COPD and/or chronic steroid medication developed CAPA more frequently, although this was not statistically significant.\n CAPA patients were admitted to the ICU earlier, had lower PF-ratios, and more often required renal replacement therapy.\n All-cause

study was to evaluate diagnostic means, host factors, delay of occurrence, and outcome of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and fungal coinfections in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n From 1 February to 31 May 2020, we anonymously recorded COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), fungemia (CA-fungemia), and pneumocystosis (CA-PCP) from 36 centers, including results on fungal biomarkers in respiratory specimens and serum.\n We collected data from 154 episodes of CAPA, 81 of CA-fungemia, 17 of CA-PCP, and 5 of other mold infections from 244 patients (male/female [M/F] ratio?=?3.5; mean age, 64.7?±?10.8?years).\n CA-PCP occurred first after ICU admission (median, 1?day; interquartile range [IQR], 0 to 3 days), followed by CAPA (9?days; IQR, 5 to 13 days), and then CA-fungemia (16?days; IQR, 12 to 23 days) (P &lt; 10?4).\n For CAPA, the presence of several mycological criteria was associated with death (P &lt; 10?4).\n Serum galactomannan was rarely positive (&lt;20%).\n The mortality rates were 76.7% (23/30) in patients with host factors for invasive fungal disease, 45.2% (14/31) in those with a preexisting pulmonary condition, and 36.6% (34/93) in the remaining patients (P = 0.001).\n Antimold treatment did not alter prognosis (P = 0.370).\n Candida albicans was responsible for 59.3% of CA-fungemias, with a global mortality of 45.7%.\n For CA-PCP, 58.8% of the episodes occurred in patients with known host factors of PCP, and the mortality rate was 29.5%.\n CAPA may be in part hospital acquired and could benefit from antifungal prescription at the first positive biomarker result.\n CA-fungemia appeared linked to ICU stay without COVID-19 specificity, while CA-PCP may not really be a concern in the ICU.\n Improved diagnostic strategy for fungal markers in ICU patients with COVID-19 should support these hypotheses.\n","id":"PMC8528108","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stéphane","surname":"Bretagne","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Karine","surname":"Sitbon","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Karine","surname":"Sitbon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Françoise","surname":"Botterel","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"Dellière","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Valérie","surname":"Letscher-Bru","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Valérie","surname":"Letscher-Bru","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Taieb","surname":"Chouaki","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Anne-Pauline","surname":"Bellanger","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Bonnal","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Arnault","surname":"Fekkar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Florence","surname":"Persat","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Florence","surname":"Persat","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Damien","surname":"Costa","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Bourgeois","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frédéric","surname":"Dalle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Florian","surname":"Lussac-Sorton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"André","surname":"Paugam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sophie","surname":"Cassaing","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lilia","surname":"Hasseine","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antoine","surname":"Huguenin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nadia","surname":"Guennouni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edith","surname":"Mazars","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Solène","surname":"Le

However, to our knowledge, the prevalence of IFIs has not yet been assessed in large populations of mechanically ventilated patients.\n\n We aimed to identify the prevalence, risk factors, and mortality associated with IFIs in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 under intensive care.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a national, multicentre, observational cohort study in 18 French intensive care units (ICUs).\n\n We retrospectively and prospectively enrolled adult patients (aged ?18 years) with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and requiring mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome, with all demographic and clinical and biological follow-up data anonymised and collected from electronic case report forms.\n\n Patients were systematically screened for respiratory fungal microorganisms once or twice a week during the period of mechanical ventilation up to ICU discharge.\n\n The primary outcome was the prevalence of IFIs in all eligible participants with a minimum of three microbiological samples screened during ICU admission, with proven or probable (pr/pb) COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) classified according to the recent ECMM/ISHAM definitions.\n\n Secondary outcomes were risk factors of pr/pb CAPA, ICU mortality between the pr/pb CAPA and non-pr/pb CAPA groups, and associations of pr/pb CAPA and related variables with ICU mortality, identified by regression models.\n\n The MYCOVID study is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04368221.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Feb 29 and July 9, 2020, we enrolled 565 mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. 509 patients with at least three screening samples were analysed (mean age 59·4 years [SD 12·5], 400 [79%] men).\n\n 128 (25%) patients had 138 episodes of pr/pb or possible IFIs.\n\n 76 (15%) patients fulfilled the criteria for pr/pb CAPA.\n\n According to multivariate analysis, age older than 62 years (odds ratio [OR] 2·34 [95% CI 1·39–3·92], p=0·0013), treatment with dexamethasone and anti-IL-6 (OR 2·71 [1·12–6·56], p=0·027), and long duration of mechanical ventilation (&gt;14 days; OR 2·16 [1·14–4·09], p=0·019) were independently associated with pr/pb CAPA.\n\n 38 (7%) patients had one or more other pr/pb IFIs: 32 (6%) had candidaemia, six (1%) had invasive mucormycosis, and one (&lt;1%) had invasive fusariosis.\n\n Multivariate analysis of associations with death, adjusted for candidaemia, for the 509 patients identified three significant factors: age older than 62 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1·71 [95% CI 1·26–2·32], p=0·0005), solid organ transplantation (HR 2·46 [1·53–3·95], p=0·0002), and pr/pb CAPA (HR 1·45 [95% CI 1·03–2·03], p=0·033).\n\n At time of ICU discharge, survival curves showed that overall ICU mortality was significantly higher in patients with pr/pb CAPA than in those without, at 61·8% (95% CI 50·0–72·8) versus 32·1% (27·7–36·7; p&lt;0·0001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis study shows the high prevalence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and candidaemia and high mortality associated with pr/pb CAPA in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. These findings highlight the need for active surveillance of fungal pathogens in patients with severe COVID-19.\nFunding\nPfizer.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8626095","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jean-Pierre","surname":"Gangneux","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Dannaoui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Arnaud","surname":"Fekkar","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Charles-Edouard","surname":"Luyt","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Françoise","surname":"Botterel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"De

multicentre phase 3 trial was performed at 46 hospitals in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium, Russia, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, and South Africa.\n\n Participants aged 18 years or older who were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, but not more than 48 h after intubation at time of first infusion, had a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 60–200 mm Hg, and a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with any variant in the past 14 days were eligible for this study.\n\n Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard of care and vilobelimab at a dose of 800 mg intravenously for a maximum of six doses (days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 22) or standard of care and a matching placebo using permuted block randomisation.\n\n Treatment was not continued after hospital discharge.\n\n Participants, caregivers, and assessors were masked to group assignment.\n\n The primary outcome was defined as all-cause mortality at 28 days in the full analysis set (defined as all randomly assigned participants regardless of whether a patient started treatment, excluding patients randomly assigned in error) and measured using Kaplan-Meier analysis.\n\n Safety analyses included all patients who had received at least one infusion of either vilobelimab or placebo.\n\n This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04333420.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Oct 1, 2020, to Oct 4, 2021, we included 368 patients in the ITT analysis (full analysis set; 177 in the vilobelimab group and 191 in the placebo group).\n\n One patient in the vilobelimab group was excluded from the primary analysis due to random assignment in error without treatment.\n\n At least one dose of study treatment was given to 364 (99%) patients (safety analysis set).\n\n 54 patients (31%) of 177 in the vilobelimab group and 77 patients (40%) of 191 in the placebo group died in the first 28 days.\n\n The all-cause mortality rate at 28 days was 32% (95% CI 25–39) in the vilobelimab group and 42% (35–49) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·73, 95% CI 0·50–1·06; p=0·094).\n\n In the predefined analysis without site-stratification, vilobelimab significantly reduced all-cause mortality at 28 days (HR 0·67, 95% CI 0·48–0·96; p=0·027).\n\n The most common TEAEs were acute kidney injury (35 [20%] of 175 in the vilobelimab group vs 40 [21%] of 189 in the placebo), pneumonia (38 [22%] vs 26 [14%]), and septic shock (24 [14%]

addition to standard of care, vilobelimab improves survival of invasive mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and leads to a significant decrease in mortality.\n\n Vilobelimab could be considered as an additional therapy for patients in this setting and further research is needed on the role of vilobelimab and C5a in other acute respiratory distress syndrome-causing viral

was conducted up to December 31, 2021.\nSTUDY SELECTION:\nPreviously peer-reviewed observational studies that reported ICU, mechanical ventilation (MV), renal replacement therapy (RRT) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-related mortality among greater than or equal to 100 individual patients.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION:\nRandom-effects meta-analysis was used to generate pooled estimates of case fatality rates (CFRs) for in-hospital, ICU, MV, RRT, and ECMO-related mortality.\n\n ICU-related mortality was additionally analyzed by the study country of origin.\n\n Sensitivity analyses of CFR were assessed based on completeness of follow-up data, by year, and when only studies judged to be of high quality were included.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS:\nOne hundred fifty-seven studies evaluating 948,309 patients were included.\n\n The CFR for in-hospital mortality, ICU mortality, MV, RRT, and ECMO were 25.9% (95% CI: 24.0–27.8%), 37.3% (95% CI: 34.6–40.1%), 51.6% (95% CI: 46.1–57.0%), 66.1% (95% CI: 59.7–72.2%), and 58.0% (95% CI: 46.9–68.9%), respectively.\n\n MV (52.7%, 95% CI: 47.5–58.0% vs 31.3%, 95% CI: 16.1–48.9%; p = 0.023) and RRT-related mortality (66.7%, 95% CI: 60.1–73.0% vs 50.3%, 95% CI: 42.4–58.2%; p = 0.003) decreased from 2020 to 2021.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWe present updated estimates of CFR for patients hospitalized and requiring intensive care for the management of COVID-19. Although mortality remain high and varies considerably worldwide, we found the CFR in patients supported with MV significantly improved since 2020.\n","id":"PMC9988289","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Abhimanyu","surname":"Chandel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sahar","surname":"Leazer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Karl C.","surname":"Alcover","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Josiah","surname":"Farley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joshua","surname":"Berk","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Jayne","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ryan","surname":"Mcnutt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Meredith","surname":"Olsen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rhonda","surname":"Allard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiahong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caitlyn","surname":"Johnson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ananya","surname":"Tripathi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Rechtin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mathew","surname":"Leon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mathias","surname":"Williams","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Phorum","surname":"Sheth","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kyle","surname":"Messer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kevin K.","surname":"Chung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jacob","surname":"Collen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.20452/pamw.16221","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients with fungal infections: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41564-022-01172-2","date":"2022-06-13","title":"COVID-19-associated fungal infections","abstract":"id='Par1'>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated invasive fungal infections are an important complication in a substantial number of critically ill, hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) has been recognized as a possible secondary infection complicating Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and increasing mortality.\n The aim of this review was to report and summarize the available data in the literature concerning the incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CAPA).\n Currently, the incidence of CAPA is unclear due to different definitions and diagnostic criteria used among the studies.\n It was estimated that approximately 8.6% (206/2383) of mechanically ventilated patients were diagnosed with either proven, probable, or putative CAPA.\n Classical host factors of invasive aspergillosis are rarely recognized in patients with CAPA, who are mainly immuno-competent presenting with comorbidities, while the role of steroids warrants further investigation.\n Direct epithelial injury and diffuse pulmonary micro thrombi in combination with immune dysregulation, hyper inflammatory response, and immunosuppressive treatment may be implicated.\n Discrimination between two forms of CAPA (e.\ng.\n, tracheobronchial and parenchymal) is required, whereas radiological signs of aspergillosis are not typically evident in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.\n In previous studies, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria, a clinical algorithm to diagnose Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in intensive care unit patients (AspICU algorithm), and influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) criteria were used for the diagnosis of proven/probable and putative CAPA, as well as the differentiation from colonization, which can be challenging.\n Aspergillus fumigatus is the most commonly isolated pathogen in respiratory cultures.\n Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum galactomannan (GM), ?-d-glucan (with limited specificity), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Aspergillus-specific lateral-flow device test can be included in the diagnostic work-up; however, these approaches are characterized by low sensitivity.\n Early treatment of CAPA is necessary, and 71.4% (135/189) of patients received antifungal therapy, mainly with voriconazole, isavuconazole, and liposomal amphotericin B .\n Given the high mortality rate among patients with Aspergillus infection, the administration of prophylactic treatment is debated.\n In conclusion, different diagnostic strategies are necessary to differentiate colonization from bronchial or parenchymal infection in intubated COVID-19 patients with Aspergillus spp.\n in their respiratory specimens vs.\n those not infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n Following confirmation, voriconazole or isavuconazole should be used for the treatment of

It primarily affects patients with COVID-19 in critical state with acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation.\n CAPA has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19, posing a serious threat to affected individuals.\n COVID-19 is a potential risk factor for CAPA and has already claimed a massive death toll worldwide since its outbreak in December 2019. Its second wave is currently progressing towards a peak, while the third wave of this devastating pandemic is expected to follow.\n Therefore, an early and accurate diagnosis of CAPA is of utmost importance for effective clinical management of this highly fatal disease.\n However, there are no uniform criteria for diagnosing CAPA in an intensive care setting.\n Therefore, based on a review of

critical care physicians.\n The main highlights of these guidelines include the role of CAPA-appropriate test specimens, clinical risk factors, computed tomography of the thorax, and non-culture-based indirect and direct mycological evidence for diagnosing CAPA in the intensive care unit.\n These guidelines classify the diagnosis of CAPA into suspected, possible, and probable categories to facilitate clinical decision-making.\n We hope that these practice guidelines will adequately address the diagnostic challenges of CAPA, providing an easy-to-use and practical algorithm to clinicians

its benefits on clinical outcomes are still being defined.\n\n Additionally, TDM data are limited for posaconazole IV and delayed-release tablet formulations among specific patient populations, including critically ill.\n\n The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of therapeutic posaconazole and voriconazole drug levels across all formulations in a real-world clinical setting and elucidate factors affecting attainment of target concentrations.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>This study was a retrospective cohort study conducted at the University of Colorado Hospital between September 2006 and June 2015 that evaluated patients who received posaconazole or voriconazole TDM as part of routine care.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Voriconazole (n = 250) and posaconazole (n = 100) levels were analyzed from 151 patients.\n\n Of these, 54% of voriconazole and 69% of posaconazole levels were therapeutic.\n\n For posaconazole, 14/38 (37%), 28/29 (97%) and 27/33 (82%) levels were

named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020.\nMethods\nIn this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs.\n\n We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge.\n\n All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done.\n\n\nFindings\nThe patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma.\n\n The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020.\nInterpretation\nWe illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy.\n\n We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.\n\n\nFunding\nREACTing (Research &amp; Action Emerging Infectious

important causes of morbidity and mortality.\n\n The consensus definitions of the Infectious Diseases Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Mycoses Study Group have been of immense value to researchers who conduct clinical trials of antifungals, assess diagnostic tests, and undertake epidemiologic studies.\n\n However, their utility has not extended beyond patients with cancer or recipients of stem cell or solid organ transplants.\n\n With newer diagnostic techniques available, it was clear that an update of these definitions was essential.\n\n\nMethods\nTo achieve this, 10 working groups looked closely at imaging, laboratory diagnosis, and special populations at risk of IFD.\n\n A final version of the manuscript was agreed upon after the groups’ findings were presented at a scientific symposium and after a 3-month period for public comment.\n\n There were several rounds of discussion before a final version of the manuscript was approved.\n\n\nResults\nThere is no change in the classifications of “proven,” “probable,” and “possible” IFD, although the definition of “probable” has been expanded and the scope of the category “possible” has been diminished.\n\n The category of proven IFD can apply to any patient, regardless of whether the patient is immunocompromised.\n\n The probable and possible categories are proposed for immunocompromised patients only, except for endemic mycoses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese updated definitions of IFDs should prove applicable in clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiologic research of a broader range of patients at high-risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7486838","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"J

several studies have indicated a high incidence of IA in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.\n\n However, few data are available on the epidemiology and outcome of patients with IA in this setting.\n\n\nMethods\nAn observational study including all patients with a positive Aspergillus culture during ICU stay was performed in 30 ICUs in 8 countries.\n\n Cases were classified as proven IA, putative IA or Aspergillus colonization according to recently validated criteria.\n\n Demographic, microbiologic and diagnostic data were collected.\n\n Outcome was recorded 12 weeks after Aspergillus isolation.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 563 patients were included, of whom 266 were colonized (47%), 203 had putative IA (36%) and 94 had proven IA (17%).\n\n The lung was the most frequent site of infection (94%), and Aspergillus fumigatus the most commonly isolated species (92%).\n\n Patients with IA had higher incidences of cancer and organ transplantation than those with colonization.\n\n Compared with other patients, they were more frequently diagnosed with sepsis on ICU admission and more frequently received vasopressors and renal replacement therapy (RRT) during the ICU stay.\n\n Mortality was 38% among colonized patients, 67% in those with putative IA and 79% in those with proven IA (P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Independent risk factors for death among patients with IA included older age, history of bone marrow transplantation, and mechanical ventilation, RRT and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at diagnosis.\n\n\nConclusions\nIA among critically ill patients is associated with high mortality.\n\n Patients diagnosed with proven or putative IA had greater severity of illness and more frequently needed organ support than those with Aspergillus

COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) in severe COVID-19 patients varies between cohorts.\n We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcome of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a regional cohort of COVID-19 intensive care patients.\n Methods: We performed a regional, multicentre, retrospective cohort study in the intensive care units (ICUs) in North Brabant, The Netherlands.\n We included adult patients with rt-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), requiring mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n Demographics, clinical course, biomarker value, and treatment outcomes were compared between the groups with possible/probable CAPA from the main study centre and the regional centres, and without signs of CAPA from the main study centre as controls.\n The primary aim was to assess the regional impact of possible/probable CAPA in COVID-19 ICU patients, measured as all-cause mortality at 30 days after ICU admission.\n Secondary outcomes were risk factors for developing CAPA, based on underlying host factors and to identify the value of the mycological arguments for the diagnosing of CAPA.\n Results: Between 1 March and 30 April 2020, we included 123 patients with severe COVID-19: 29 patients (30.9%) in the main ICU with possible/probable CAPA, and 65 (69.1%) with no signs of CAPA; 29 patients in the regional ICUs with signs of CAPA.\n Patients’ characteristics and risk factors did not differ for CAPA and non-CAPA patients.\n Patients with COPD and/or chronic steroid medication developed CAPA more frequently, although this was not statistically significant.\n CAPA patients were admitted to the ICU earlier, had lower PF-ratios, and more often required renal replacement therapy.\n All-cause 30-day mortality was significantly higher in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with possible/probable CAPA 39.7% (23/58) compared to patients without evidence for CAPA 16.9% (11/65) (OR 3.2 [95% CI 1.4–7.4] p = 0.005).\n Conclusion: The high incidence of possible and probable CAPA in critically ill COVID-19 patients is alarming.\n The increase in 30-day mortality in CAPA highlights the

in respiratory specimens and serum.\n We collected data from 154 episodes of CAPA, 81 of CA-fungemia, 17 of CA-PCP, and 5 of other mold infections from 244 patients (male/female [M/F] ratio?=?3.5; mean age, 64.7?±?10.8?years).\n CA-PCP occurred first after ICU admission (median, 1?day; interquartile range [IQR], 0 to 3 days), followed by CAPA (9?days; IQR, 5 to 13 days), and then CA-fungemia (16?days; IQR, 12 to 23 days) (P &lt; 10?4).\n For CAPA, the presence of several mycological criteria was associated with death (P &lt; 10?4).\n Serum galactomannan was rarely positive (&lt;20%).\n The mortality rates were 76.7% (23/30) in patients with host factors for invasive fungal disease, 45.2% (14/31) in those with a preexisting pulmonary condition, and 36.6% (34/93) in the remaining

the episodes occurred in patients with known host factors of PCP, and the mortality rate was 29.5%.\n CAPA may be in part hospital acquired and could benefit from antifungal prescription at the first positive biomarker result.\n CA-fungemia appeared linked to ICU stay without COVID-19 specificity, while CA-PCP may not really be a concern in the ICU.\n Improved diagnostic strategy for fungal

(IPA) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and to describe the patient characteristics associated with IPA occurrence and to evaluate its impact on prognosis.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study including all successive COVID-19 patients, hospitalized in four ICUs, with secondary deterioration and one or more respiratory samples sent to the mycology department.\n\n We used a strengthened IPA testing strategy including seven mycological criteria.\n\n Patients were classified as probable IPA according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (MSGERC) classification if immunocompromised, and according to the recent COVID-19-associated IPA classification otherwise.\n\n\nResults\nProbable IPA was diagnosed in 21 out of the 366 COVID-19 patients (5.7%) admitted to the ICU and in the 108 patients (19.4%) who underwent respiratory sampling for deterioration.\n\n No significant differences were observed between patients with and without IPA regarding age, gender, medical history and severity on admission

intensive care units (ICUs).\n\n We retrospectively and prospectively enrolled adult patients (aged ?18 years) with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and requiring mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome, with all demographic and clinical and biological follow-up data anonymised and collected from electronic case report forms.\n\n Patients were systematically screened for respiratory fungal microorganisms once or twice a week during the period of mechanical ventilation up to ICU discharge.\n\n The primary outcome was the prevalence of IFIs in all eligible participants with a minimum of three microbiological samples screened during ICU admission, with proven or probable (pr/pb) COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) classified according to the recent ECMM/ISHAM definitions.\n\n Secondary outcomes were risk factors of pr/pb CAPA, ICU mortality between the pr/pb CAPA and non-pr/pb CAPA groups, and associations of pr/pb CAPA and related variables with ICU mortality, identified by regression models.\n\n The MYCOVID study is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04368221.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Feb 29 and July 9, 2020, we enrolled 565 mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. 509 patients with at least three screening samples were analysed (mean age 59·4 years [SD 12·5], 400 [79%] men).\n\n 128 (25%) patients had 138 episodes of pr/pb or possible IFIs.\n\n 76 (15%) patients fulfilled the criteria for pr/pb CAPA.\n\n According to multivariate analysis, age older than 62 years (odds ratio [OR] 2·34 [95% CI 1·39–3·92], p=0·0013), treatment with dexamethasone and anti-IL-6 (OR 2·71 [1·12–6·56], p=0·027), and long duration of mechanical ventilation (&gt;14 days; OR 2·16 [1·14–4·09], p=0·019) were independently associated with pr/pb CAPA.\n\n 38 (7%) patients had one or more other pr/pb IFIs: 32 (6%) had candidaemia, six (1%) had invasive mucormycosis, and one (&lt;1%) had invasive fusariosis.\n\n Multivariate analysis of associations with death, adjusted for candidaemia, for the 509 patients identified three significant factors: age older than 62 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1·71 [95% CI 1·26–2·32], p=0·0005), solid organ transplantation (HR 2·46 [1·53–3·95], p=0·0002), and pr/pb CAPA (HR 1·45 [95% CI 1·03–2·03], p=0·033).\n\n At time of ICU discharge, survival curves showed that overall ICU mortality was significantly higher in patients with pr/pb CAPA than in those without, at 61·8% (95% CI 50·0–72·8) versus 32·1% (27·7–36·7; p&lt;0·0001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis study shows the high prevalence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and candidaemia and high mortality associated with pr/pb CAPA in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19.

Medical Center through a clinical data warehouse.\n\n Corticosteroid use was subcategorized into total cumulative dose, early 7-day dose, mean daily dose, and duration of use.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2,427 patients were screened, and 218 patients were included.\n\n CAPA was diagnosed in 4.6% (10/218) of all hospitalized and 11.2% (10/89) of intensive care unit patients.\n\n Total cumulative dose

IPA group, 31% (n = 5) of the patients died, compared to 13% (n = 9) in the non-CAPA group (P = 0.08).\n\n We conclude that CAPA is a frequent co-infection in critically ill COVID-19 patients and is associated with a high mortality rate.\n\n The timely diagnosis and treatment of IPA in these patients is likely to improve their outcome.\n\n\nLay Summary\nWe studied the characteristics of patients with COVID-19-associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA).\n\n Patients with CAPA tended to need invasive mechanical ventilation more frequently and to have a higher mortality rate.\n\n

extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-related mortality among greater than or equal to 100 individual patients.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION:\nRandom-effects meta-analysis was used to generate pooled estimates of case fatality rates (CFRs) for in-hospital, ICU, MV, RRT, and ECMO-related mortality.\n\n ICU-related mortality was additionally analyzed by the study country of origin.\n\n Sensitivity analyses of CFR were assessed based on completeness of follow-up data, by year, and when only studies judged to be of high quality were included.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS:\nOne hundred fifty-seven studies evaluating 948,309 patients were included.\n\n The CFR for in-hospital mortality, ICU mortality, MV, RRT, and ECMO were 25.9% (95% CI: 24.0–27.8%), 37.3% (95% CI: 34.6–40.1%), 51.6% (95% CI:

Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) has been recognized as a possible secondary infection complicating Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and increasing mortality.\n The aim of this review was to report and summarize the available data in the literature concerning the incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CAPA).\n Currently, the incidence of CAPA is unclear due to different definitions and diagnostic criteria used among the studies.\n It was estimated that approximately 8.6% (206/2383) of mechanically ventilated patients were diagnosed with either proven, probable, or putative CAPA.\n Classical host factors of invasive aspergillosis are rarely recognized in patients with CAPA, who are mainly immuno-competent presenting with comorbidities, while the role of steroids warrants further investigation.\n Direct epithelial injury and diffuse pulmonary micro thrombi in combination with immune dysregulation, hyper inflammatory response, and immunosuppressive treatment may be implicated.\n Discrimination between two forms of CAPA (e.\ng.\n, tracheobronchial and parenchymal) is required, whereas radiological signs of aspergillosis are not typically evident in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.\n In previous studies, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria, a clinical algorithm to diagnose Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in intensive care unit patients (AspICU algorithm), and influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) criteria were used for the diagnosis of proven/probable and putative CAPA, as well as the differentiation from colonization, which can be challenging.\n Aspergillus fumigatus is the most commonly isolated pathogen in respiratory cultures.\n Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum galactomannan (GM), ?-d-glucan (with limited specificity), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Aspergillus-specific lateral-flow device test can be included in the diagnostic work-up; however, these approaches are characterized by low sensitivity.\n Early treatment of CAPA is necessary, and 71.4% (135/189) of patients received antifungal therapy, mainly with voriconazole, isavuconazole, and liposomal amphotericin B .\n Given the high mortality rate among patients with Aspergillus infection, the administration of prophylactic treatment is debated.\n In conclusion, different diagnostic strategies are necessary to differentiate colonization from bronchial or parenchymal infection in intubated COVID-19 patients with Aspergillus spp.\n in their respiratory specimens vs.\n those not infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n Following confirmation, voriconazole or isavuconazole should be used for the treatment of

It primarily affects patients with COVID-19 in critical state with acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation.\n CAPA has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19, posing a serious threat to affected individuals.\n COVID-19 is a potential risk factor for CAPA and has already claimed a massive death toll worldwide since its outbreak in December 2019. Its second wave is currently progressing towards a peak, while the third wave of this devastating pandemic is expected to follow.\n Therefore, an early and accurate diagnosis of CAPA is of utmost importance for effective clinical management of this highly fatal disease.\n However, there are no uniform criteria for diagnosing CAPA in an intensive care setting.\n Therefore, based on a review of existing information and our own experience, we have proposed new criteria in the form of practice guidelines for diagnosing CAPA, focusing on the points relevant for intensivists and pulmonary and critical care physicians.\n The main highlights of these guidelines include the role of CAPA-appropriate test specimens, clinical risk factors, computed tomography of the thorax, and non-culture-based indirect and direct mycological evidence for diagnosing CAPA in the intensive care unit.\n These guidelines classify the diagnosis of CAPA into suspected, possible, and probable categories to facilitate clinical decision-making.\n We hope that these practice guidelines will adequately address the diagnostic challenges of CAPA, providing an easy-to-use and practical algorithm to clinicians

methods to identify authentic lung microbiota in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid that contains substantial oropharyngeal admixture.\n We studied clinical BAL samples from six selected subjects with potential heavy lung colonization.\n A single sample of BAL fluid was obtained from each subject along with contemporaneous oral wash (OW) to sample the oropharynx, and then DNA was extracted from three separate aliquots of each.\n Bacterial 16S rDNA sequences were amplified and products analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing.\n By comparing replicates, we were able to specify the depth of sequencing needed to reach a 95% chance of identifying a bacterial lineage of a given proportion—for example, at a depth of 5,000 tags, OTUs of proportion 0.3% or greater would be called with 95% confidence.\n We next constructed a single-sided outlier test that allowed lung-enriched organisms to be quantified against a background of oropharyngeal admixture, and assessed improvements available with replicate sequence analysis.\n This allowed identification of lineages enriched in lung in some BAL specimens.\n Finally, using samples from healthy volunteers collected at multiple sites in the upper respiratory tract, we show that OW provides a reasonable but not perfect surrogate for bacteria carried into to the lung by a bronchoscope.\n These methods allow identification of microbes that can replicate in the lung despite the background due to oropharyngeal microbes derived from aspiration and bronchoscopic

The distributions of several genera were systematically altered by smoking in both the oro- and nasopharynx, and there was an enrichment of anaerobic lineages associated with periodontal disease in the oropharynx.\n These results indicate that distinct regions of the human upper respiratory tract contain characteristic microbial communities that exhibit disordered patterns in cigarette smokers, both in individual components and global structure, which may contribute to the prevalence of respiratory tract complications in this population.\n","id":"PMC3004851","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emily

in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), it is essential to enhance our knowledge on the composition of the microbial community to improve patient management.\n\n In this study, we developed a pyrosequencing approach to extensively explore the diversity and dynamics of fungal and prokaryotic populations in CF lower airways.\n\n\nMethodology and Principal Findings\nFungi and bacteria diversity in eight sputum samples collected from four adult CF patients was investigated using conventional microbiological culturing and high-throughput pyrosequencing approach targeting the ITS2 locus and the 16S rDNA gene.\n\n The unveiled microbial community structure was compared to the clinical profile of the CF patients.\n\n Pyrosequencing confirmed recently reported bacterial diversity and observed complex fungal communities, in which more than 60% of the species or genera were not detected by cultures.\n\n Strikingly, the diversity and species richness of fungal and bacterial communities was significantly lower in patients with decreased lung function and poor clinical status.\n\n Values of Chao1 richness estimator were statistically correlated with values of the Shwachman-Kulczycki score, body mass index, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (p?=?0.046, 0.047, 0.004, and 0.001, respectively for fungal Chao1 indices, and p?=?0.010, 0.047,

biocompartments.\n We have revised current practices in sequence-based taxonomy assignments and employed the improvements to address the question of the fungal genera present in the healthy human mouth.\n The human oral mycobiome was surveyed using massively parallel, high throughput sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplicons from saliva following robust extraction methods.\n Taxonomy was assigned by comparison to a curated reference dataset, followed by filtering with an empirically determined BLAST E-value match statistic (10?42).\n Nomenclature corrections further refined results by conjoining redundant names for a single fungal genus.\n Following these curation steps, about two-thirds of the initially identified genera were eliminated.\n In comparison with the one similar metagenomic study and several earlier culture-based ones, our findings change the current conception of the oral mycobiome, especially with the discovery of the high prevalence and abundance of the genus Malassezia.\n Previously identified as an important pathogen of the skin, and recently reported as the predominant fungal genus at the nostril and backs of the head and ear, this is the first account of Malassezia in the human mouth.\n Findings from this study were in good agreement with others on the existence of many consensus members of the core mycobiome, and on unique patterns for individual subjects.\n This research offered a cautionary note about unconditional acceptance of lengthy lists of community members produced by automated assignments, provided a

multiple discrete tissue sites in the lungs of six subjects removed at the time of transplantation.\n We performed BAL on three never-smokers (NS) with normal spirometry, seven smokers with normal

relationships (both oppositional and symbiotic) between microbial inhabitants are important contributors to this variation.\n It is thus of interest to assess what relationships might exist among microbes and determine their underlying reasons.\n The initial Human Microbiome Project (HMP) cohort, comprising 239 individuals and 18 different microbial habitats, provides an unprecedented resource to detect, catalog, and analyze such relationships.\n Here, we applied an ensemble method based on multiple similarity measures in combination with generalized boosted linear models (GBLMs) to taxonomic marker (16S rRNA gene) profiles of this cohort, resulting in a global network of 3,005 significant co-occurrence and co-exclusion relationships between 197 clades occurring throughout the human microbiome.\n This network revealed strong niche specialization, with most microbial associations occurring within body sites and a number of accompanying inter-body site relationships.\n Microbial communities within the oropharynx grouped into three distinct habitats, which themselves showed no direct influence on the composition of the gut microbiota.\n Conversely, niches such as the vagina demonstrated little to no decomposition into region-specific interactions.\n Diverse mechanisms underlay individual interactions, with some such as the co-exclusion of Porphyromonaceae family members and Streptococcus in the subgingival plaque supported by known biochemical dependencies.\n These differences varied among broad phylogenetic groups as well, with the Bacilli and Fusobacteria, for example, both enriched for exclusion of taxa from other clades.\n Comparing phylogenetic versus functional similarities among bacteria, we show that dominant commensal taxa (such as Prevotellaceae and Bacteroides in the gut) often compete, while potential pathogens (e.\ng.\n Treponema and Prevotella in the dental plaque) are more likely to co-occur in complementary niches.\n This approach thus

complications.\n\n There is great interest to use dietary means to manipulate the microbiota to promote health.\n\n Currently, the impact of dietary change on the microbiota and the host metabolism is poorly predictable and highly individual.\n\n We propose that the responsiveness of the gut microbiota may depend on its composition, and associate with metabolic changes in the host.\n\n\nMethodology\nOur study involved three independent cohorts of obese adults (n?=?78) from Belgium, Finland, and Britain, participating in different dietary interventions aiming to improve metabolic health.\n\n We used a phylogenetic microarray for comprehensive fecal microbiota analysis at baseline and after the intervention.\n\n Blood cholesterol, insulin and inflammation markers were analyzed as indicators of host response.\n\n The data were divided into four training set – test set pairs; each intervention acted both as a part of a training set and as an independent test set.\n\n We used linear models to predict the responsiveness of the microbiota and the host, and logistic regression to predict responder vs.\n\n non-responder status, or increase vs.\n\n decrease of the health parameters.\n\n\nPrincipal Findings\nOur models, based on the abundance of several, mainly Firmicute species at baseline, predicted the responsiveness of the microbiota (AUC ?=? 0.77–1;

compared to those in the respiratory tract, yet some bacteria overlapped, demonstrating a core microbiota dominated by Veillonella and Streptococcus.\n Bacterial diversity increased significantly over

Here, we used pyrosequencing to characterize the oral bacteriome and mycobiome of 12 HIV-infected patients and matched 12 uninfected controls.\n The number of bacterial and fungal genera in individuals ranged between 8–14 and 1–9, among uninfected and HIV-infected participants, respectively.\n The core oral bacteriome (COB) comprised 14 genera, of which 13 were common between the two

inhibited growth of Candida, Aspergillus and Fusarium.\n Moreover, Pichia cells and PSM inhibited Candida biofilms (P?=?.\n002 and .\n02, respectively, compared to untreated controls).\n The mechanism by which Pichia inhibited Candida involved nutrient limitation, and modulation of growth and virulence factors.\n Finally, in an experimental murine model of oral candidiasis, we demonstrated that mice treated with PSM exhibited significantly lower infection score (P?=?.\n011) and fungal burden (P?=?.\n04) compared to untreated mice.\n Moreover, tongues of PSM-treated mice had few hyphae and

Assessing Soil Microbial Abundance and Community Structure","abstract":"Soil DNA extraction has become a critical step in describing microbial biodiversity.\n Historically, ascertaining overarching microbial ecological theories has been hindered as independent studies have used numerous custom and commercial DNA extraction procedures.\n For that reason, a standardized soil DNA extraction method (ISO-11063) was previously published.\n However, although this ISO method is suited for molecular tools such as quantitative PCR and community fingerprinting techniques, it has only been optimized for examining soil bacteria.\n Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess an appropriate soil DNA extraction procedure for examining bacterial, archaeal and fungal diversity in soils of contrasting land-use and physico-chemical properties.\n Three different procedures were tested: the ISO-11063 standard; a custom procedure (GnS-GII); and a modified ISO procedure (ISOm) which includes a different mechanical lysis step (a FastPrep ®-24 lysis step instead of the recommended bead-beating).\n The efficacy of each method was first assessed by estimating microbial biomass through total DNA quantification.\n Then, the abundances and community structure of bacteria, archaea and fungi were determined using real-time PCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism approaches.\n Results showed that DNA yield was improved with the GnS-GII and ISOm procedures, and fungal community patterns were found to be strongly dependent on the extraction method.\n The main methodological factor responsible for differences between extraction procedure efficiencies was found to be the soil homogenization step.\n For integrative studies which aim to examine bacteria, archaea and fungi simultaneously, the ISOm procedure results in higher DNA recovery and better represents microbial communities.\n","id":"PMC3439486","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Plassart","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sébastien","surname":"Terrat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bruce","surname":"Thomson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Griffiths","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Samuel","surname":"Dequiedt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mélanie","surname":"Lelievre","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tiffanie","surname":"Regnier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Virginie","surname":"Nowak","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Bailey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Lemanceau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Bispo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abad","surname":"Chabbi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre-Alain","surname":"Maron","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Mougel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lionel","surname":"Ranjard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vishal","surname":"Shah","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Vishal","surname":"Shah","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003371","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Asthma

(NCFBr).\n\n In contrast to other chronic airway infections, associated with COPD and CF bronchiectasis, where polymicrobial communities have been implicated in lung damage due to the vicious circle of recurrent bacterial infections and inflammation, there is sparse information on the composition of bacterial communities in NCFBr.\n\n Seventy consecutive patients were recruited from an outpatient adult NCFBr clinic.\n\n Bacterial communities in sputum samples were analysed by culture and pyrosequencing approaches.\n\n Bacterial sequences were analysed using partial least square discrimination analyses to investigate trends in community composition and identify those taxa that contribute most to community variation.\n\n\nResults\nThe lower airway in NCFBr is dominated by three bacterial taxa Pasteurellaceae, Streptococcaceae and Pseudomonadaceae.\n\n Moreover, the bacterial community is much more diverse than indicated by culture and contains significant numbers of other genera including anaerobic Prevotellaceae, Veillonellaceae and Actinomycetaceae.\n\n We found particular taxa are correlated with different clinical states, 27 taxa were associated with acute exacerbations, whereas 11 taxa correlated with stable clinical states.\n\n We were unable to demonstrate a significant effect of antibiotic therapy, gender, or lung function on the diversity of the bacterial

samples from individuals with cystic fibrosis","abstract":"Background\nHuman-associated microbial communities include fungi, but we understand little about which fungal species are present, their relative and absolute abundances, and how antimicrobial therapy impacts fungal communities.\n\n The disease cystic fibrosis (CF) often involves chronic airway colonization by bacteria and fungi, and these infections cause irreversible lung damage.\n\n Fungi are detected more frequently in CF sputum samples upon initiation of antimicrobial therapy, and several studies have implicated the detection of fungi in sputum with worse outcomes.\n\n Thus, a more complete understanding of fungi in CF is required.\n\n\nResults\nWe characterized the fungi and bacteria in expectorated sputa from six CF subjects.\n\n Samples were collected upon admission for systemic antibacterial therapy and upon the completion of treatment and analyzed using a pyrosequencing-based analysis of fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and bacterial 16S rDNA sequences.\n\n A mixture of Candida species and Malassezia dominated the mycobiome in all samples (74%–99% of fungal reads).\n\n There was not a striking trend correlating fungal and bacterial richness, and richness showed a decline after antibiotic therapy particularly for the bacteria.\n\n The fungal communities within a sputum sample resembled other samples from that subject despite the aggressive antibacterial therapy.\n\n Quantitative PCR analysis of fungal 18S rDNA sequences to assess fungal burden showed variation in fungal density in sputum before and after antibacterial therapy but no consistent directional trend.\n\n Analysis of Candida ITS1 sequences amplified from sputum or pure culture-derived genomic DNA from individual Candida species found little (&lt;0.5%) or no variation in ITS1 sequences within or between strains, thereby validating this locus for the purpose of Candida species identification.\n\n We also report the enhancement of the publically available Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures (VAMPS) tool for the analysis of fungal communities in clinical samples.\n\n\nConclusions\nFungi are present in CF respiratory sputum.\n\n In CF, the use of intravenous antibiotic therapy often does not profoundly impact bacterial community structure, and we observed a similar stability in fungal species composition.\n\n Further studies are required to predict the effects of antibacterials on fungal burden in CF and fungal community stability in non-CF populations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4236224","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sven

known whether variations in the prevalence of species of microbiota in the lungs may have aetiological significance in respiratory conditions such as asthma.\n\n The aim of the study was to undertake semi-quantitative analysis of the differences in fungal species in pooled sputum samples from asthma patients and controls.\n\n\nMethods\nInduced sputum samples were collected in a case control study of asthma patients and control subjects drawn from the community in Wandsworth, London.\n\n Samples from both groups were pooled and then tested for eukaryotes.\n\n DNA was amplified using standard PCR techniques, followed by pyrosequencing and comparison of reads to databases of known sequences to determine in a semi-quantitative way the percentage of DNA from known species in each of the two pooled samples.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 136 fungal species were identified in the induced sputum samples, with 90 species more common in asthma patients and 46 species more common in control subjects.\n\n Psathyrella candolleana, Malassezia pachydermatis, Termitomyces clypeatus and Grifola sordulenta showed a higher percentage of reads in the sputum of asthma patients and Eremothecium sinecaudum, Systenostrema alba, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Vanderwaltozyma polyspora showed a higher percentage of reads in the sputum of control subjects.\n\n A statistically significant

evidence for the widespread nature of fungi in the sputum of healthy and asthmatic individuals.\n\n Differences in the pattern of fungi present in asthma patients and controls merit further

Several studies examining the direct interaction between Aspergillus fumigatus and purified innate immune cells have been conducted to measure the responses of both the host cells and the pathogen.\n It has been revealed that innate immune cells have different modes of action ranging from effective fungal killing by neutrophils to the less aggressive response of dendritic cells.\n Natural killer cells do not phagocytose the fungus unlike the other innate immune cells mentioned but appear to mediate their antifungal effect through the release of gamma interferon.\n Transcriptional analysis of A.\n fumigatus interacting with these cells has indicated that it can adapt to the harsh microenvironment of the phagosome and produces toxins, ribotoxin and gliotoxin, that can induce cell death in

Immunity against <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> Infection Using a Mouse Model of Pulmonary Cryptococcosis","abstract":"\nCryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia and meningoencephalitis in immune compromised individuals.\n Previous studies have shown that immunization of BALB/c mice with an IFN-?-producing C.\n neoformans strain, H99?, results in complete protection against a second pulmonary challenge with an otherwise lethal cryptococcal strain.\n The current study evaluated local anamnestic cell-mediated immune responses against pulmonary cryptococcosis in mice immunized with C.\n neoformans strain H99? compared to mice immunized with heat-killed C.\n neoformans (HKC.\nn.\n).\n Mice immunized with C.\n neoformans strain H99? had significantly reduced pulmonary fungal burden post-secondary challenge compared to mice immunized with HKC.\nn.\n Protection against pulmonary cryptococcosis was associated with increased pulmonary granulomatous formation and leukocyte infiltration followed by a rapid resolution of pulmonary inflammation, which protected the lungs from severe allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM)-pathology that developed in the lungs of mice immunized with HKC.\nn.\n Pulmonary challenge of interleukin (IL)-4 receptor, IL-12p40, IL-12p35, IFN-?, T cell and B cell deficient mice with C.\n neoformans strain H99? demonstrated a requirement for Th1-type T cell-mediated immunity, but not B cell-mediated immunity, for the induction of H99?-mediated protective immune responses against pulmonary C.\n neoformans infection.\n CD4+ T cells, CD11c+ cells, and Gr-1+ cells were increased in both proportion and absolute number in protected mice.\n In addition, significantly increased production of Th1-type/pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and conversely, reduced Th2-type cytokine production was observed in the lungs of protected mice.\n Interestingly,

profile of individuals with hematological malignancies (n = 18) who developed IMI during the course of chemotherapy or HSCT, and compared it to that of hematological patients who had no evidence of

chemotherapy and HSCT recipients with IMI.\n Compared to hematological controls, individuals with IA and mucormycosis had defective expression of dectin-1; in addition, patients with mucormycosis had decreased TLR2 and increased TLR4 expression.\n Since fungal recognition via dectin-1 favors T helper 17 responses and the latter are highly dependent on activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, we next used phospho-flow cytometry to measure the phosphorylation of the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3 in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-?) and interleukin (IL)-6, respectively.\n While IFN-?/STAT1 signaling was similar between groups, naïve T cells from patients with IA, but not those with mucormycosis, exhibited reduced responsiveness to IL-6 as measured by STAT3 phosphorylation.\n Furthermore, IL-6 increased Aspergillus-induced IL-17 production in culture supernatants from healthy and hematological controls but not in patients with

efficient clearance by pulmonary defense mechanisms.\n Upon inhalation, fungi will first encounter the airway surface liquid which contains several soluble effector molecules that form the first barrier of defense against fungal infections.\n These include host defense peptides, like LL-37 and defensins that can neutralize fungi by direct killing of the pathogen, and collectins, such as surfactant protein A and D, that can aggregate fungi and stimulate phagocytosis.\n In addition, these molecules have immunomodulatory activities which can aid in fungal clearance from the lung.\n However, existing observations are based on in vitro studies which do not reflect the complexity of the lung and its airway surface liquid.\n Ionic strength, pH, and the presence of mucus can have strong detrimental effects on antifungal activity, while the potential synergistic interplay between soluble effector molecules is largely unknown.\n In this review, we describe the current knowledge

in immunocompromised hosts.\n\n The role of the airway epithelium involves a complex interaction with the inhaled pathogen.\n\n Antimicrobial peptides with direct antifungal and chemotactic activities may boost antifungal immune response.\n\n\nResults\nThe inducible expression of defensins by human bronchial epithelial 16HBE cells and A549 pneumocyte cells exposed to A.\n\n fumigatus was investigated.\n\n Using RT-PCR and real time PCR, we showed an activation of hBD2 and hBD9 defensin genes: the expression was higher in cells exposed to swollen conidia (SC), compared to resting conidia (RC) or hyphal fragments (HF).\n\n The kinetics of defensin expression was different for each one, evoking a putative distinct function for each investigated defensin.\n\n The decrease of defensin expression in the presence of heat-inactivated serum indicated a possible link between defensins and the proteins of the host complement system.\n\n The presence of defensin peptide hBD2 was revealed using immunofluorescence that showed a punctual cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining.\n\n Quantification of the cells stained with anti hBD2 antibody demonstrated that SC induced a greater number of cells that synthesized hBD2, compared to RC or HF.\n\n Labelling of the cells with anti-hBD-2 antibody showed a positive immunofluorescence signal around RC or SC in contrast to HF.\n\n This suggests co-localisation of hBD2 and digested conidia.\n\n The HBD2 level was highest in the supernatants of cells exposed to SC, as was determined by sandwich ELISA.\n\n Experiments using neutralising anti-interleukine-1? antibody reflect the autocrine mechanism of defensin expression induced by SC.\n\n Investigation of defensin expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels demonstrated the requirement of transcription as well as new protein synthesis during A.\n\n fumigatus defensin induction.\n\n Finally, induced defensin expression in primary culture of human respiratory cells exposed to A.\n\n fumigatus points to the biological significance of described phenomena.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur findings provide evidence that respiratory epithelium might play an important role in the immune response during Aspergillus infection.\n\n Understanding the mechanisms of regulation of defensin expression may thus lead to new approaches that could enhance expression of antimicrobial peptides for potential therapeutic use during aspergillosis

innate defense mechanisms during intracellular infections.\n The ability of autophagy to tag and target intracellular pathogens toward lysosomal degradation is central to this key defense function.\n However, studies involving the role and regulation of autophagy during intracellular infections largely tend to ignore the housekeeping function of autophagy.\n A growing number of evidences now suggest that the housekeeping function of autophagy, rather than the direct pathogen degradation function, may play a decisive role to determine the outcome of infection and immunological balance.\n We discuss herein the studies that establish the homeostatic and anti-inflammatory function of autophagy, as well as role of bacterial effectors in modulating and coopting these functions.\n Given that the core autophagy machinery remains largely the same across diverse cargos, how selectivity plays out during intracellular infection remains intriguing.\n We explore here, the contrasting role of autophagy adaptors being both selective as well as pleotropic in functions and discuss whether E3 ligases could bring in the specificity to cargo

protein light-chain 3 (LC3) is a key autophagy-related protein that is recruited to the double-membrane autophagosome responsible for sequestering material intended for delivery to lysosomes.\n GFP-LC3 is widely used as a marker of autophagosome formation as denoted by the formation of green puncta when viewed by fluorescence microscopy.\n Recently, it has been demonstrated that LC3 can be recruited to other membranes including single-membrane phagosomes, in a process termed LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP).\n Thus, the observation of green puncta in cells can no longer, by itself, be taken as evidence of autophagy.\n This review will clarify those features of LAP which serve to distinguish it from autophagy and that make connections with host autophagic responses in terms of infection by microbial pathogens.\n More specifically, it will refer to concurrent studies of the mechanism by which LAP is triggered in comparison to

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

risk of Wuhan novel coronavirus within and beyond China, January-April 2020: a travel network-based modelling study","abstract":"Background:\nid='P9'>A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan City, China, at the end of 2019 and has caused an outbreak of human-to-human transmission with a Public Health Emergency of International Concern declared by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020.\nAim:\nid='P10'>We aimed to estimate the potential risk and geographic range of Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread within and beyond China from January through to April, 2020.\nMethods:\nid='P11'>A series of domestic and international travel network-based connectivity and risk analyses were performed, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports.\n\n\nResults:\nid='P12'>The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China.\n\n We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 – 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to Wuhan’s lockdown.\n\n The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases.\n\n Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent.\n\n\nConclusion:\nid='P13'>Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur.\n\n All countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7276059","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shengjie","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Isaac

postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of

of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus","abstract":"A large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been detected in horseshoe bats since 2005 in different areas of China.\n However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV.\n Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China.\n The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei-Ping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Yi","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia-Zheng","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Zhi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong-Sheng","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Niang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1073/pnas.0506735102","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe

Proteases Enhances Virus Entry into Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells <italic>In Vitro</italic>\n","abstract":"Background\nEntry of enveloped viruses into host cells requires the activation of viral envelope glycoproteins through cleavage by either intracellular or extracellular proteases.\n\n In order to gain insight into the molecular basis of protease cleavage and its impact on the efficiency of viral entry, we investigated the susceptibility of a recombinant native full-length S-protein trimer (triSpike) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to cleavage by various airway proteases.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nPurified triSpike proteins were readily cleaved in vitro by three different airway proteases: trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a.\n\n High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and amino acid sequencing analyses identified two arginine residues (R667 and R797) as potential protease cleavage site(s).\n\n The effect of protease-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV infection was demonstrated with ACE2 expressing human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE.\n\n Airway proteases regulate the infectivity of SARS-CoV in a fashion dependent on previous receptor binding.\n\n The role of arginine residues was further shown with mutant constructs (R667A, R797A or R797AR667A).\n\n Mutation of R667 or R797 did not affect the expression of S-protein but resulted in a differential efficacy of pseudotyping into SARS-CoVpp.\n\n The R667A SARS-CoVpp mutant exhibited a lack of virus entry enhancement following protease treatment.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThese results suggest that SARS S-protein is susceptible to airway protease cleavage and, furthermore, that protease mediated enhancement of virus entry depends on specific conformation of SARS S-protein upon ACE2 binding.\n\n These data have direct implications for the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV along the respiratory system and, furthermore expand the possibility of identifying potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2773421","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yiu-Wing","surname":"Kam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuushi","surname":"Okumura","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hiroshi","surname":"Kido","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lisa

Evidence for Bats as the Evolutionary Source of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","abstract":"The evolutionary origins of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are unknown.\n Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from various species in the family Vespertilionidae.\n Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV identified from a Pipistrellus cf.\n hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV.\n Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties.\n Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor.\n To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated.\n Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells.\n Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat.\n Recombination in the S1 subunit of the spike gene was identified as the primary mechanism driving variation

complexity have prevented its use as a practical front-line diagnostic for unknown infectious diseases.\n Here we demonstrate the utility of two metagenomics-based strategies, a pan-viral microarray (Virochip) and deep sequencing, for the identification and characterization of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus.\n Using nasopharyngeal swabs collected during the earliest stages of the pandemic in Mexico, Canada, and the United States (n?=?17), the Virochip was able to detect a novel virus most closely related to swine influenza viruses without a priori information.\n Deep sequencing yielded reads corresponding to 2009 H1N1 influenza in each sample (percentage of aligned sequences corresponding to 2009 H1N1 ranging from 0.0011% to 10.9%), with up to 97% coverage of the influenza genome in one sample.\n Detection of 2009 H1N1 by deep sequencing was possible even at titers near the limits of detection for specific RT-PCR, and the percentage of sequence reads was linearly correlated with virus titer.\n Deep sequencing also provided insights into the upper respiratory microbiota and host gene expression in response to 2009 H1N1 infection.\n An unbiased analysis combining sequence data from all 17 outbreak samples revealed that 90% of the 2009 H1N1 genome could be assembled de novo without the use of any reference sequence, including assembly of several near full-length genomic segments.\n These results indicate that a streamlined metagenomics detection strategy can potentially replace the multiple conventional diagnostic tests required to investigate an outbreak of a novel pathogen, and provide a blueprint for comprehensive diagnosis of unexplained acute illnesses or outbreaks in clinical and public health settings.\n","id":"PMC2956640","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander L.","surname":"Greninger","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eunice

Viral Infection-Induced Microbiome Alterations and Secondary Bacterial Pneumonia","abstract":"Influenza and other respiratory viral infections are the most common type of acute respiratory infection.\n Viral infections predispose patients to secondary bacterial infections, which often have a more severe clinical course.\n The mechanisms underlying post-viral bacterial infections are complex, and include multifactorial processes mediated by interactions between viruses, bacteria, and the host immune system.\n Studies over the past 15 years have demonstrated that unique microbial communities reside on the mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory tract, which have both direct and indirect effects on host defense against viral infections.\n In addition, antiviral immune responses induced by acute respiratory infections such as influenza are associated with changes in microbial composition and function (“dysbiosis”) in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, which in turn may alter subsequent immune function against secondary bacterial infection or alter the dynamics of inter-microbial interactions, thereby enhancing the proliferation of potentially pathogenic bacterial species.\n In this review, we summarize the literature on the interactions between host microbial communities and host defense, and how influenza, and other acute respiratory viral infections disrupt these interactions, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of secondary bacterial infections.\n","id":"PMC6250824","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shigeo","surname":"Hanada","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mina","surname":"Pirzadeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kyle

commonly believed that the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the next influenza pandemic will mimic those of the 1918 pandemic.\n Determinative beliefs regarding the 1918 pandemic include that infections were expressed as primary viral pneumonias and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome, that pandemic-related deaths were the end states of the natural progression of disease caused by the pandemic strain, and that bacterial superinfections caused relatively fewer deaths in 1918 than in subsequent pandemics.\n In turn, response plans are focused on developing and/or increasing inventories of a strain-specific vaccine, antivirals, intensive care beds, mechanical ventilators, and so on.\n Yet, there is strong and consistent evidence of epidemiologically and clinically important interactions between influenza and secondary bacterial respiratory pathogens, including during the 1918 pandemic.\n Countermeasures (eg, vaccination against pneumococcal and meningococcal disease before a pandemic; mass uses of antibiotic(s) with broad spectrums of activity against common bacterial respiratory pathogens during local epidemics) designed to prevent or mitigate the effects of influenza-bacterial interactions should be major focuses of pandemic-related research, prevention, and response

to that of seasonal influenza.\n\n In July 2009, however, Argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths, representing a CFR of 4.5%.\n\n Potential explanations for increased CFR included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population.\n\n Virus genomic sequencing of 26 Argentinian samples representing both severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence.\n\n Furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for H1N1pdm disease.\n\n\nMethods/Principal Findings\nWe examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (NPS) from 199 cases of H1N1pdm infection from Argentina with MassTag PCR, testing for 33 additional microbial agents.\n\n The study population consisted of 199 H1N1pdm-infected subjects sampled between 23 June and 4 July 2009. Thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n?=?20) or hospitalization (n?=?19); 160 had mild disease.\n\n At least one additional agent of potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including Streptococcus pneumoniae (n?=?62); Haemophilus influenzae (n?=?104); human respiratory syncytial virus A (n?=?11) and B (n?=?1); human rhinovirus A (n?=?1) and B (n?=?4); human coronaviruses 229E (n?=?1) and OC43 (n?=?2); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n?=?2); Acinetobacter baumannii (n?=?2); Serratia marcescens (n?=?1); and Staphylococcus aureus (n?=?35) and methicillin-resistant S.\n\n aureus (MRSA, n?=?6).\n\n The presence of S.\n\n pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease.\n\n S.\n\n pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of H1N1pdm NPS with S.\n\n pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 S.\n\n pneumoniae-positive NPS, p?=?0.0004).\n\n In subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of severe disease in the presence of S.\n\n pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.95, 928.72; p&lt;0.0001).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThe association of S.\n\n pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics.\n\n However, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of S.\n\n pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2795195","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gustavo","surname":"Palacios","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mady","surname":"Hornig","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Cisterna","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nazir","surname":"Savji","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ana Valeria","surname":"Bussetti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vishal","surname":"Kapoor","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeffrey","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rafal","surname":"Tokarz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Briese","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elsa","surname":"Baumeister","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"W.

infections such as influenza (flu).\n Caloric restriction represents a known strategy to slow many aging processes, including those involving the immune system.\n More recently, some changes in the microbiome have been described with aging, while the gut microbiome appears to influence responses to flu vaccination and infection.\n With these considerations in mind, we used a well-established mouse model of flu infection to explore the impact of flu infection, aging, and caloric restriction on the gut microbiome.\n Young, middle-aged, and aged caloric restricted (CR) and ad lib fed (AL) mice were examined after a sublethal flu infection.\n All mice lost 10–20% body weight and, as expected for these early time points, losses were similar at different ages and between diet groups.\n Cytokine and chemokine levels were also similar with the notable exception of IL-1?, which rose more than fivefold in aged AL mouse serum, while it remained unchanged in aged CR serum.\n Fecal microbiome phyla abundance profiles were similar in young, middle-aged, and aged AL mice at baseline and at 4?days post flu infection, while increases in Proteobacteria were evident at 7?days post flu infection in all three age groups.\n CR mice, compared to AL mice in each age group, had increased abundance of Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia at all time points.\n Interestingly, principal coordinate analysis determined that diet exerts a greater effect on the microbiome than age or flu infection.\n Percentage body weight loss correlated with the relative abundance of Proteobacteria regardless of age, suggesting flu pathogenicity is related to Proteobacteria abundance.\n Further, several microbial Operational Taxonomic Units from the Bacteroidetes phyla correlated with serum chemokine/cytokines regardless of both diet and age suggesting an interplay between flu-induced systemic inflammation and gut microbiota.\n These exploratory studies highlight the impact of caloric restriction on fecal microbiome in both young and aged animals, as well as the many complex relationships between flu responses and gut microbiota.\n Thus, these preliminary studies provide the necessary groundwork to examine how gut microbiota alterations may be leveraged to influence declining immune responses with aging.\n","id":"PMC5611400","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jenna

infections have an impact on the gut microbiota.\n There is also considerable interest in whether the gut microbiota could be manipulated during vaccination to improve efficacy.\n In this highly controlled study, we aimed to establish the effect of viral lung infection on gut microbiota composition and the gut environment using mouse models of common respiratory pathogens respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus.\n This was then compared to the effect of live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccination.\n Both RSV and influenza virus infection resulted in significantly altered gut microbiota diversity, with an increase in Bacteroidetes and a concomitant decrease in Firmicutes phyla abundance.\n Although the increase in the Bacteroidetes phylum was consistent across several experiments, differences were observed at the family and operational taxonomic unit level.\n This suggests a change in gut conditions after viral lung infection that favors Bacteroidetes outgrowth but not individual families.\n No change in gut microbiota composition was observed after LAIV vaccination, suggesting that the driver of gut microbiota change is specific to live viral infection.\n Viral lung infections also resulted in an increase in fecal lipocalin-2, suggesting low-grade gut inflammation, and colonic Muc5ac levels.\n Owing to the important role that mucus plays in the gut environment, this may explain the changes in microbiota composition observed.\n This study demonstrates that the gut microbiota and the gut environment are altered following viral lung infections and that these changes are not observed during vaccination.\n Whether increased mucin levels and gut inflammation drive, or are a result of, these changes is still to be

influenza A outbreak of 2009 and determine if microbiome profiles could be correlated with patient characteristics.\n We determined the microbial profiles of 65 samples from H1N1 patients by cpn60

authority, sample type and designation (STAT/non-STAT).\n At the phylum level, Actinobacteria-, Firmicutes- and Proteobacteria-dominated microbiomes were observed, with none of the patient characteristics showing significant profile composition differences.\n At the nearest neighbor “species” level, the upper respiratory tract microbiomes were composed of 13-20 “species” and showed a trend towards increasing diversity with patient age.\n Interestingly, at an individual level, most patients had one to three organisms dominant in their microbiota.\n A limited number of discrete microbiome profiles were observed, shared among influenza patients regardless of patient status variables.\n To assess the validity of analyses derived from sequence read abundance, several bacterial species were quantified by quantitative PCR and compared to the abundance of cpn60 sequence read counts obtained in the study.\n A strong positive correlation between read abundance and absolute

(Virochip) and deep sequencing, for the identification and characterization of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus.\n Using nasopharyngeal swabs collected during the earliest stages of the pandemic in Mexico, Canada, and the United States (n?=?17), the Virochip was able to detect a novel virus most closely related to swine influenza viruses without a priori information.\n Deep sequencing yielded reads corresponding to 2009 H1N1 influenza in each sample (percentage of aligned sequences corresponding to 2009 H1N1 ranging from 0.0011% to 10.9%), with up to 97% coverage of the influenza genome in one sample.\n Detection of 2009 H1N1 by deep sequencing was possible even at titers near the limits of detection for specific RT-PCR, and the percentage of sequence reads was linearly correlated with virus titer.\n Deep sequencing also provided insights into the upper respiratory microbiota and host gene expression in response to 2009 H1N1 infection.\n An unbiased analysis combining sequence data from all 17 outbreak samples revealed that 90% of the 2009 H1N1 genome could be assembled de novo without the use of any reference sequence, including assembly of several near full-length genomic segments.\n These results indicate that a streamlined metagenomics detection strategy can potentially replace the multiple conventional diagnostic tests required to investigate an outbreak of a novel pathogen, and provide a blueprint for comprehensive diagnosis of unexplained acute illnesses or outbreaks in clinical and public health

Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis.\n Disturbance of a balanced nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiome might be involved in the onset of symptomatic infections with these pathogens, which occurs primarily in fall and winter.\n It is unknown whether seasonal infection patterns are associated with concomitant changes in NP microbiota.\n As young children are generally prone to respiratory and invasive infections, we characterized the NP microbiota of 96 healthy children by barcoded pyrosequencing of the V5–V6 hypervariable region of the 16S-rRNA gene, and compared microbiota composition between children sampled in winter/fall with children sampled in spring.\n The approximately 1000000 sequences generated represented 13 taxonomic phyla and approximately 250 species-level phyla types (OTUs).\n The 5 most predominant phyla were Proteobacteria (64%), Firmicutes (21%), Bacteroidetes (11%), Actinobacteria (3%) and Fusobacteria (1,4%) with Moraxella, Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Flavobacteria, Dolosigranulum, Corynebacterium and Neisseria as predominant genera.\n The inter-individual variability was that high that on OTU level a core microbiome could not be defined.\n Microbiota profiles varied strongly with season, with in fall/winter a predominance of Proteobacteria (relative abundance (% of all sequences): 75% versus 51% in spring) and Fusobacteria (absolute abundance (% of children): 14% versus 2% in spring), and in spring a predominance of Bacteroidetes (relative abundance: 19% versus 3% in fall/winter, absolute abundance: 91% versus 54% in fall/winter), and Firmicutes.\n The latter increase is mainly due to (Brevi)bacillus and Lactobacillus species (absolute abundance: 96% versus 10% in fall/winter) which are like Bacteroidetes species generally related to healthy ecosystems.\n The observed seasonal effects could not be attributed to recent antibiotics or viral

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been used to characterize the nasopharyngeal microbiome of infants and adults during health and disease; less is known, however, about the composition and temporal

adolescents (6 to 18 years) and determine their stability over time.\n\n\nMethods\nTwo nasopharyngeal washes collected 5.5 to 6.5 months apart were taken from 40 children and adolescents with asthma living in the Washington D.\n\nC.\n\n area.\n\n Sequence data from the 16S-V4 rRNA gene region (~250 bp) were collected from the samples using the MiSeq platform.\n\n Raw data were processed in mothur

pseudodiphtheriticum is a Gram-positive bacterium found as a member of the normal microbiota of the upper respiratory tract.\n It was suggested that C.\n pseudodiphtheriticum may be potentially used as a next-generation probiotic for nasal application, although no deep studies were performed in this regard.\n We hypothesized that human isolate C.\n pseudodiphtheriticum strain 090104 is able to modulate the respiratory innate immune response and beneficially influence the resistance to viral and bacterial infections.\n Therefore, in the present study we investigated how the exposure of infant mice to nasal priming with viable or non-viable C.\n pseudodiphtheriticum 090104 influences the respiratory innate immune response triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 activation, the susceptibility to primary Respiratory Synsytial Virus (RSV) infection, and the resistance to secondary Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia.\n We demonstrated that the nasal priming with viable C.\n pseudodiphtheriticum 090104 differentially modulated TLR3-mediated innate antiviral immune response in the respiratory tract of infant mice, improving their resistance to primary RSV infection, and secondary pneumococcal pneumonia.\n In association with the protection against RSV-pneumococcal superinfection, we found that viable C.\n pseudodiphtheriticum improved lung CD3+CD4+IFN-?+, and CD3+CD4+IL-10+ T cells as well as CD11c+SiglecF+IFN-?+ alveolar macrophages.\n Of interest, non-viable bacteria did not have the same protective effect, suggesting that C.\n pseudodiphtheriticum colonization is needed for achieving its protective effect.\n In conclusion, we present evidence that nasal application of viable C.\n pseudodiphtheriticum could be thought as an alternative to boost defenses against RSV and secondary pneumococcal pneumonia, which should be further studied and validated in clinical trials.\n Due to the absence of a long-lasting immunity, re-infection with RSV throughout life is common.\n Thus, a possible perspective use could be a seasonal application of a nasal probiotic spray to boost respiratory innate immunity in immunocompetent subjects.\n","id":"PMC5572367","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paulraj","surname":"Kanmani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patricia","surname":"Clua","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maria

showing differential virulence gene expression characteristics resulting in a significantly increased ability to disseminate and cause infection of otherwise sterile sites, such as the middle ear,

disease/physiologic/developmental states.\n However, differences in experimental protocols used may produce variation that outweighs biological differences.\n By comparing 16S rRNA gene sequences generated from diverse studies of the human microbiota using the QIIME database, we found that variation in composition of the microbiota across different body sites was consistently larger than technical variability across studies.\n However, samples from different studies of the Western adult fecal microbiota generally clustered by study, and the 16S rRNA target region, DNA extraction technique, and sequencing platform produced systematic biases in observed diversity that could obscure biologically meaningful compositional differences.\n In contrast, systematic compositional differences in the fecal microbiota that occurred with age and between Western and more agrarian cultures were great enough to outweigh technical variation.\n Furthermore, individuals with ileal Crohn's disease and in their third trimester of pregnancy often resembled infants from different studies more than controls from the same study, indicating parallel compositional attributes of these

microbial communities and host phenotype.\n Shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing is a relatively new and powerful environmental sequencing approach that provides insight into community biodiversity and function.\n But, the analysis of metagenomic sequences is complicated due to the complex structure of the data.\n Fortunately, new tools and data resources have been developed to circumvent these complexities and allow researchers to determine which microbes are present in the community and what they might be doing.\n This review describes the analytical strategies and specific tools that can be applied to metagenomic data and the considerations and caveats associated with their use.\n Specifically, it documents how metagenomes can be analyzed to quantify community structure and diversity, assemble novel genomes, identify new taxa and genes, and determine which metabolic pathways are encoded in the community.\n It also discusses several methods that can be used compare metagenomes to identify taxa and functions that differentiate communities.\n","id":"PMC4059276","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas

Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics, and early microbial exposure have all been implicated.\n Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analyzed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats to date.\n We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat’s signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals.\n The project encountered an estimated 81–99% of the genera, enzyme families, and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome.\n Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata.\n These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology, and translational

healthy host physiology, whereby disruption of this ecosystem has been linked to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC).\n The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies such as the 16S rRNA gene sequencing has enabled characterization of the CRC gut microbiome architecture in an affordable and culture-free approach.\n Nevertheless, the lack of standardization in handling and storage of biospecimens, nucleic acid extraction, 16S rRNA gene primer selection, length, and depth of sequencing and bioinformatics analyses have contributed to discrepancies found in various published studies of this field.\n Accurate characterization of the CRC microbiome found in different stages of CRC has the potential to be developed into a screening tool in the clinical setting.\n This mini review aims to concisely compile all available CRC microbiome studies performed till end of 2016 and to suggest standardized protocols that are crucial in developing a gut microbiome screening panel

operational taxonomic units (OTUs): clusters of sequencing reads that differ by less than a fixed dissimilarity threshold.\n New methods control errors sufficiently such that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences over the sequenced gene region.\n The benefits of finer resolution are immediately apparent, and arguments for ASV methods have focused on their improved resolution.\n Less obvious, but we believe more important, are the broad benefits that derive from the status of ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning identified independently from a reference database.\n Here we discuss how these features grant ASVs the combined advantages of closed-reference OTUs—including computational costs that scale linearly with study size, simple merging between independently processed data sets, and forward prediction—and of de novo OTUs—including accurate measurement of diversity and applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in reference databases.\n We argue that the improvements in reusability, reproducibility and comprehensiveness are sufficiently great that ASVs should replace OTUs as the standard unit of marker-gene analysis and reporting.\n","id":"PMC5702726","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Benjamin

metagenomics","abstract":"Background\nVSEARCH is an open source and free of charge multithreaded 64-bit tool for processing and preparing metagenomics, genomics and population genomics nucleotide sequence data.\n\n It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use.\n\n\nMethods\nWhen searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH.\n\n VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH.\n\n Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads.\n\n\nResults\nVSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or de novo), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling.\n\n VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.\n\ne.\n\n, format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads.\n\n Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion.\n\n VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging.\n\n VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication.\n\n VSEARCH is available at https://github.\n\ncom/torognes/vsearch under either the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version 3.0.\nDiscussion\nVSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH.\n\n A free and open-source versatile tool for sequence analysis is now available to the metagenomics community.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5075697","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Torbjørn","surname":"Rognes","email":"torognes@ifi.uio.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tomáš","surname":"Flouri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Nichols","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Quince","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frédéric","surname":"Mahé","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tomas","surname":"Hrbek","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tomas","surname":"Hrbek","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

property for analyzing microbial diversity","abstract":"Background\nThe operational taxonomic unit (OTU) is widely used in microbial ecology.\n\n Reproducibility in microbial ecology research depends on the reliability of OTU-based 16S ribosomal subunit RNA (rRNA) analyses.\n\n\nResults\nHere, we report that many hierarchical and greedy clustering methods produce unstable OTUs, with membership that depends on the number of sequences clustered.\n\n If OTUs are regenerated with additional sequences or samples, sequences originally assigned to a given OTU can be split into different OTUs.\n\n Alternatively, sequences assigned to different OTUs can be merged into a single OTU.\n\n This OTU instability affects alpha-diversity analyses such as rarefaction curves, beta-diversity analyses such as distance-based ordination (for example, Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA)), and the identification of differentially represented OTUs.\n\n Our results show that the proportion of unstable OTUs varies for different clustering methods.\n\n We found that the closed-reference method is the only one that produces completely stable OTUs, with the caveat that sequences that do not match a pre-existing reference sequence collection are discarded.\n\n\nConclusions\nAs a compromise to the factors listed above, we propose using an open-reference method to enhance OTU stability.\n\n This type of method clusters sequences against a database and includes unmatched sequences by clustering them via a relatively stable de novo clustering method.\n\n OTU stability is an important consideration when analyzing microbial diversity and is a feature that should be taken into account during the development of novel OTU clustering methods.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe

human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analyzed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats to date.\n We found the diversity and

The aim of this study was to explore whether further speed could be gained by other approaches to parallelisation.\n\n\nResults\nA faster approach and implementation is described and benchmarked.\n\n In the new tool SWIPE, residues from sixteen different database sequences are compared in parallel to one query residue.\n\n Using a 375 residue query sequence a speed of 106 billion cell updates per second (GCUPS) was achieved on a dual Intel Xeon X5650 six-core processor system, which is over six times more rapid than software based on Farrar's 'striped' approach.\n\n SWIPE was about 2.5 times faster when the programs used only a single thread.\n\n For shorter queries, the increase in speed was larger.\n\n SWIPE was about twice as fast as BLAST when using the BLOSUM50 score matrix, while BLAST was about twice as fast as SWIPE for the BLOSUM62 matrix.\n\n The software is designed for 64 bit Linux on processors with SSSE3.

Event time was defined as the first administration of an antibiotic with in\nvitro activity against the infecting organism.\n\n Healthcare exposure status was categorized as community-acquired, healthcare-associated, or hospital-acquired.\n\n Time to appropriate therapy among groups of patients with differing healthcare exposure status was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.\n\n\nResults\nThe cohort included 578 patients with gram-negative BSI, including 320 (55%) healthcare-associated, 217 (38%) community-acquired, and 41 (7%) hospital-acquired infections.\n\n 529 (92%) patients received an appropriate antibiotic during their hospitalization.\n\n Time to appropriate therapy was significantly different among the groups of healthcare exposure status (log-rank p=0.02).\n\n Time to first antibiotic administration regardless of drug appropriateness was not different between groups (p=0.3).\n\n The unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) (95% confidence interval) were 0.80 (0.65-0.98) for healthcare-associated and 0.72 (0.63-0.82) for hospital-acquired, relative to patients with community-acquired BSI.\n\n In multivariable

of appropriate antibiotics for gram-negative BSI compared to patients with community-acquired BSI.\n\n This difference was not due to delayed initiation of antibiotic therapy, but due to the inappropriate choice of antibiotic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3789716","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rebekah

contacts in households, as well as the antimicrobial resistance of Bordetella pertussis (B.\n\n pertussis) in Zhejiang Province, China.\n\n\nMethods\nWe have collected the retrospective and prospective data of children who were suspected of pertussis and their close contacts in households from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020, in the Children’s Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.\n\n Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and cultured for B.\n\n pertussis.\n\n Antibiotics susceptibility test was determined by using E-test methods.\n\n Clinical information was collected from the medical records systems.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 350 index patients and their 946 family members (close contacts in households) from 350 families were

nonresponding CAP and whether there is a significant difference in the clinical characteristics between viral and nonviral nonresponding CAP.\n\n \nMethods\n From 2016 to 2019, nonresponding CAP patients were retrospectively enrolled in our study.\n\n All patients received bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and virus detection in BAL fluid by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and

the application of mNGS for the diagnosis of pulmonary infections.\n In this study we evaluated the diagnostic efficiency and clinical impact of mNGS on pulmonary infections.\n A total of 100 respiratory samples were collected from patients diagnosed with pulmonary infection in Shanghai, China.\n Conventional methods, including culture and standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel analysis for respiratory tract viruses, and mNGS were used for the pathogen detection in respiratory samples.\n The difference in the diagnostic yield between conventional methods and mNGS demonstrated that mNGS had higher sensitivity than traditional culture for the detection of pathogenic bacteria and fungi (95% vs 54%; p&lt;0.001).\n Although mNGS had lower sensitivity than PCR for diagnosing viral infections, it identified 14 viral species that were not detected using conventional methods, including multiple subtypes of human herpesvirus.\n mNGS detected viruses with a genome

diagnosis of clinical pathogens remains challenging.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom December 2019 to March 2021, 134 specimens including Broncho alveolar lavage fluid (BAFL), blood, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bile, pleural fluid, pus, were continuously collected in The First Hospital of Qinhuangdao, and their retrospective diagnoses were classified into infectious disease (128, 95.5%) and noninfectious disease (6, 4.5%).\n\n The pathogen-detection performance of mNGS was compared with conventional microbiological tests (CMT) and culture method.\n\n In addition, the antibiotic

Next-Generation Sequencing vs. Traditional Pathogen Detection in the Diagnosis of Infection After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Children","abstract":"Infection is a severe complication of allo-HSCT in children, however, the accurate detection of the infection is hard.\n In this study, we traced the records of 101 pediatric recipients with allo-HSCT to investigate the pathogens of infection, and collected 54 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, 32 blood, and 15 cerebrospinal fluid samples.\n In these samples, 87 was with post-transplant infection and 14 without infection.\n Using the metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and traditional pathogen detection, we compared their sensitivity and specificity to detect pathogens of infection.\n Our results showed that mNGS was more sensitive (89.7%) than conventional pathogen detection (21.8%), with a difference of 67.9% (P &lt; 0.001), However, mNGS was less specific (78.5%) than traditional methods (92.9%), with a difference of 14.4% (P = 0.596).\n The sensitivity of mNGS for diagnosing pulmonary infections, bloodstream infections or viremia, and CNS infections post-transplant were 91.7, 85.7, and 90.9%, respectively.\n In contrast, the sensitivity of conventional testing for diagnosing pulmonary infections, bloodstream infections or viremia, and CNS infections post-transplant were 22.9, 21.4, and 18.2%, respectively.\n There were significant differences in the sensitivity of mNGS and conventional testing in BALF, blood, and CSF samples, with P values of 0.000, 0.000, and 0.002 respectively.\n Among the patients with pulmonary infection, 11 pathogens were both identified by mNGS and conventional testing, and 33 by mNGS only.\n The percentage with the mNGS-positive result was 44/48 (91.7%), including viruses (n = 12), bacteria (n = 17), fungi (n = 9) and mixed infections (n = 6).\n Among the patients diagnosed with fungal pneumonia (n = 9), the most prevalent pathogenic fungi were Pneumocystis jiroveci (n = 6), which were also detected in 4 patients with mixed infectious pneumonia.\n In the 28 blood specimens of patients with bloodstream infections or viremia, five patients were positive by both mNGS and conventional testing, 19 were positive by mNGS, and 1 was positive by traditional testing only.\n The percentage with the mNGS-positive results was 24/28 (85.7%), including viruses (n = 12), bacteria (n = 4), fungi (n = 3), and mixed infections (n = 5).\n Of the 15 CSF specimens enrolled, 11 patients were eventually diagnosed with CNS infections.\n Ten pathogens were identified by mNGS in the 11 patients, including viruses (n = 8), bacteria (n = 1), and fungi (n = 1).\n These results suggest that mNGS is more sensitive than conventional pathogen detection for diagnosing infections post HSCT in children which may help the clinic diagnosis.\n Pneumocystis jiroveci was the most frequent pathogen of pulmonary infections post-transplant, while viruses were the most common pathogens of CNS infections in allo-HSCT

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrom Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) it has become increasingly clear that bats are important reservoirs of CoVs.\n Despite this, only 6% of all CoV sequences in GenBank are from bats.\n The remaining 94% largely consist of known pathogens of public health or agricultural significance, indicating that current research effort is heavily biased towards describing known diseases rather than the ‘pre-emergent’ diversity in bats.\n Our study addresses this critical gap, and focuses on resource poor countries where the risk of zoonotic emergence is believed to be highest.\n We surveyed the diversity of CoVs in multiple host taxa from twenty countries to explore the factors driving viral diversity at a global scale.\n We identified sequences representing 100 discrete phylogenetic clusters, ninety-one of which were found in bats, and used ecological and epidemiologic analyses to show that patterns of CoV diversity correlate with those of bat diversity.\n This cements bats as the major evolutionary reservoirs and ecological drivers of CoV diversity.\n Co-phylogenetic reconciliation analysis was also used to show that host switching has contributed to CoV evolution, and a preliminary analysis suggests that regional variation exists in the dynamics of this process.\n Overall our study represents a model for exploring global viral diversity and advances our fundamental understanding of CoV biodiversity and the potential risk factors associated with zoonotic emergence.\n","id":"PMC5467638","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Simon

characterization of the 2019 novel human-pathogenic coronavirus isolated from a patient with atypical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan","abstract":"A mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China.\n Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization.\n We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes.\n Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV.\n The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses.\n However, the external subdomain of Spike’s receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses.\n Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein.\n Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.\n Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus.\n These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.\n","id":"PMC7067204","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper

information on the viral fusogenic mechanism.\n\n We used a similar approach to study the fusogenic mechanism of severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n\nMethods\nWe tested the inhibitory activity against infection of two sets of peptides corresponding to sequences of SARS-CoV spike protein HR1 and HR2 regions and investigated the interactions between the HR1 and HR2 peptides by surface plasmon resonance, sedimentation equilibration analysis, circular dichroism, native polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography, and computer-aided homology modelling and molecule docking analysis.\n\n\nFindings\nOne peptide, CP-1, derived from the HR2 region, inhibited SARS-CoV infection in the micromolar range.\n\n CP-1 bound with high affinity to a peptide from the HR1 region, NP-1. CP-1 alone had low -helicity and self-associated to form a trimer in phosphate buffer (pH 7·2).\n\n CP-1 and NP-1 mixed in equimolar concentrations formed a six-helix bundle, similar to the fusogenic core structure of HIV-1 gp41.\nInterpretation\nAfter binding to the target cell, the transmembrane spike protein might change conformation by association between the HR1 and HR2 regions to form an oligomeric structure, leading to fusion between the viral and target-cell membranes.\n\n At the prefusion intermediate state, CP-1 could bind to the HR1 region and interfere with the conformational changes, resulting in inhibition of SARS-CoV fusion with the target cells.\n\n CP-1 might be modifiable to increase its anti-SARS-CoV activity and could be further developed as an antiviral agent for treatment or prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7140173","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shuwen","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gengfu","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yibang","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuxian","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinkui","surname":"Niu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carlos R","surname":"Escalante","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huabao","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James","surname":"Farmar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Asim K","surname":"Debnath","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Po","surname":"Tien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shibo","surname":"Jiang","email":"SJiang@NYBloodcenter.org","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1126/sciadv.aav4580","date":"2019-02-14","title":"A pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting the HR1 domain of human coronavirus spike","abstract":"EK1 is a broad-spectrum human coronavirus fusion inhibitor for combating infection of current and emerging coronaviruses.\n","id":"PMC6457931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shuai","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anurodh Shankar","surname":"Agrawal","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anurodh Shankar","surname":"Agrawal","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abdullah","surname":"Algaissi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chien-Te K.","surname":"Tseng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qian","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lanying","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjie","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ian A.","surname":"Wilson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shibo","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shibo","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1080/14728222.2017.1271415","date":"1970-01-01","title":"MERS-CoV spike protein: a key target for antivirals","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3390/v11010060","date":"2019-01-10","title":"Advances in MERS-CoV Vaccines and Therapeutics Based on the Receptor-Binding Domain","abstract":"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an infectious virus that was first reported in 2012.

Clinical outcomes for patients with severe infections improve when antibiotics are appropriately chosen and given early.\n\n The objective of this study was to estimate the association of prior healthcare exposure on time to appropriate antibiotic therapy in patients with gram-negative BSI.\n\n\nMethod\nWe performed a multicenter cohort study of adult, hospitalized patients with gram-negative BSI using time to event analysis in nine community hospitals from 2003-2006. Event time was defined as the first administration of an antibiotic with in\nvitro activity against the infecting organism.\n\n Healthcare exposure status was categorized as community-acquired, healthcare-associated, or hospital-acquired.\n\n Time to appropriate therapy among groups of patients with differing healthcare exposure status was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.\n\n\nResults\nThe cohort included 578 patients with gram-negative BSI, including 320 (55%) healthcare-associated, 217 (38%) community-acquired, and 41 (7%) hospital-acquired infections.\n\n 529 (92%) patients received an appropriate antibiotic during their hospitalization.\n\n Time to appropriate therapy was significantly different among the groups of healthcare exposure status (log-rank p=0.02).\n\n Time to first antibiotic administration regardless of drug appropriateness was not different between groups (p=0.3).\n\n The unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) (95% confidence interval) were 0.80 (0.65-0.98) for healthcare-associated and 0.72 (0.63-0.82) for hospital-acquired, relative to patients with community-acquired BSI.\n\n In multivariable analysis, interaction was found between the main effect and baseline Charlson comorbidity index.\n\n When Charlson index was 3, adjusted HRs were 0.66 (0.48-0.92) for healthcare-associated and 0.57 (0.44-0.75) for hospital-acquired, relative to patients with community-acquired infections.\n\n\nConclusions\nPatients with healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired BSI experienced delays in receipt of appropriate antibiotics for gram-negative BSI compared to patients with community-acquired BSI.\n\n This difference was not due to delayed initiation of antibiotic therapy, but due to the inappropriate choice of antibiotic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3789716","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rebekah

pneumonia is responsible for the most mortality of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\n\n However, thus far, it is not clear whether viral infection plays an important role in the etiology of nonresponding CAP and whether there is a significant difference in the clinical characteristics between viral and nonviral nonresponding CAP.\n\n \nMethods\n From 2016 to 2019, nonresponding CAP patients were retrospectively enrolled in our study.\n\n All patients received bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and virus detection in BAL fluid by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data were collected.\n\n \nResults\n A total of 43 patients were included.\n\n The median age was 62 years, and 65.1% of patients were male.\n\n Overall, 20 patients (46.5%) were identified with viral infection.\n\n Of these viruses, influenza virus (n?=?8) and adenovirus (n?=?7) were more frequently detected, and others included herpes simplex virus,

Sequencing","abstract":"Pulmonary infections are among the most common and important infectious diseases due to their high morbidity and mortality, especially in older and immunocompromised individuals.\n However, due to the limitations in sensitivity and the long turn-around time (TAT) of conventional diagnostic methods, pathogen detection and identification methods for pulmonary infection with greater diagnostic efficiency are urgently needed.\n In recent years, unbiased metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) has been widely used to detect different types of infectious pathogens, and is especially useful for the detection of rare and newly emergent pathogens, showing better diagnostic performance than traditional methods.\n There has been limited research exploring the application of mNGS for the diagnosis of pulmonary infections.\n In this study we evaluated the diagnostic efficiency and clinical impact of mNGS on pulmonary infections.\n A total of 100 respiratory samples were collected from patients diagnosed with pulmonary infection in Shanghai, China.\n Conventional methods, including culture and standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel analysis for respiratory tract viruses, and mNGS were used for the pathogen detection in respiratory samples.\n The difference in the diagnostic yield between conventional methods and mNGS demonstrated that mNGS had higher sensitivity than traditional culture for the detection of pathogenic bacteria and fungi (95% vs 54%; p&lt;0.001).\n Although mNGS had lower sensitivity than PCR for diagnosing viral infections, it identified 14 viral species that were not detected using conventional methods, including multiple subtypes of human herpesvirus.\n mNGS detected viruses with a genome coverage &gt;95% and a sequencing depth &gt;100× and provided reliable phylogenetic and epidemiological information.\n mNGS offered extra benefits, including a shorter TAT.\n As a complementary

Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor,

2019 novel human-pathogenic coronavirus isolated from a patient with atypical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan","abstract":"A mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China.\n Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization.\n We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes.\n Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV.\n The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses.\n However, the external subdomain of Spike’s receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses.\n Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein.\n Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.\n Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus.\n These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.\n","id":"PMC7067204","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper

patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters.\n\n We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples.\n\n We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked.\n\n\nFindings\nPatients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years.\n\n Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints.\n\n When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild.\n\n Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease.\n\n A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients.\n\n By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nA coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease.\n\n Serological and

However, the evolutionary pathway of MERS-CoV is still unclear.\n A receptor binding domain (RBD) in the MERS-CoV envelope-embedded spike protein specifically engages human CD26 (hCD26) to initiate viral entry.\n The high sequence identity in the viral spike protein prompted us to investigate if HKU4 and HKU5 can recognize hCD26 for cell entry.\n We found that HKU4-RBD, but not HKU5-RBD, binds to hCD26, and pseudotyped viruses embedding HKU4 spike can infect cells via hCD26 recognition.\n The structure of the HKU4-RBD/hCD26 complex revealed a hCD26-binding mode similar overall to that

study was performed to compare the apoptosis and necrosis profiles induced by full-length 3b, a 3b mutant that was deleted by 30 amino acids from the C terminus (3b?124-154) and the classical apoptosis inducer, Bax.\n Our results showed that Vero E6 cells transfected with a construct for expressing 3b underwent necrosis as early as 6 h after transfection and underwent simultaneous necrosis

The 3b?124-154 mutant behaves in a similar manner indicating that the localization of the 3b protein does not seems to be important for the cell-death pathways since full-length 3b is localized predominantly to the nucleolus, while the mutant is found to be concentrated in the peri-nuclear regions.\n To our knowledge, this is the first report of the induction of necrosis by a SARS-CoV

(TGF-?)-induced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 but attenuates Smad3/Smad4-mediated apoptosis of human peripheral lung epithelial HPL1 cells.\n The promoting effect of N protein on the transcriptional responses of TGF-? is Smad3-specific.\n N protein associates with Smad3 and promotes Smad3-p300 complex formation while it interferes with the complex formation between Smad3 and Smad4. These findings provide evidence of a novel mechanism whereby N protein modulates TGF-? signaling to block apoptosis of SARS-CoV-infected host cells and meanwhile promote tissue fibrosis.\n Our results reveal a novel mode of Smad3 action in a Smad4-independent manner and may lead to successful strategies for SARS treatment by targeting the TGF-? signaling

bacterial growth, cell lysis and permeabilization to different compounds.\n Thus, exit of labeled nucleotides from E.\n coli cells to the cytoplasm was apparent upon expression of MHV E.\n In

These genes differ distinctly among the three coronavirus groups and are specific for each group.\n While the essential genes encode replication and structural functions, hardly anything is known about the products and functions of the group-specific genes.\n As a first step to elucidate their significance, we deleted the group-specific genes from the group 2 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome via a novel targeted recombination system based on host switching (L.\n Kuo, G.\n J.\nGodeke, M.\n J.\n Raamsman, P.\n S.\n Masters, and P.\n J.\n M.\n Rottier, 2000, J.\n Virol.\n 74, 1393–1406).\n Thus, we obtained recombinant viruses from which the two clusters of group-specific genes were deleted either separately or in combination in a controlled genetic background.\n As all recombinant deletion mutant viruses appeared to be viable, we conclude that the MHV group-specific genes are nonessential, accessory genes.\n Importantly, all deletion mutant viruses were attenuated when inoculated into their natural host, the mouse.\n Therefore, deletion of the coronavirus group-specific genes seems to provide an attractive approach to generate attenuated live coronavirus

Efficacy in Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice.\n\n VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Damon","surname":"Deming","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Heise","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boyd","surname":"Yount","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mehul","surname":"Suthar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jack","surname":"Harkema","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Whitmore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Raymond","surname":"Pickles","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ande","surname":"West","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Donaldson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kristopher","surname":"Curtis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Johnston","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.ppat.0030005","date":"2006-11-15","title":"A

disease.\n Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of

respiratory disease, SARS, with significant mortality.\n Although factors contributing to the highly pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV remain poorly understood, it has been reported that SARS-CoV infection does not induce type I interferons (IFNs) in cell culture.\n However, it is uncertain whether SARS-CoV evades host detection or has evolved mechanisms to counteract innate host defenses.\n We show here that infection of SARS-CoV triggers a weak IFN response in cultured human lung/bronchial epithelial cells without inducing the phosphorylation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a latent cellular transcription factor that is pivotal for type I IFN synthesis.\n Furthermore, SARS-CoV infection blocked the induction of IFN antiviral activity and the up-regulation of protein expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes triggered by double-stranded RNA or an unrelated paramyxovirus.\n In searching for a SARS-CoV protein capable of counteracting innate immunity, we identified the papain-like protease (PLpro) domain as a potent IFN antagonist.\n The inhibition of the IFN response does not require the protease activity of PLpro.\n Rather, PLpro interacts with IRF-3 and inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3, thereby disrupting the activation of type I IFN responses through either Toll-like receptor 3 or retinoic acid-inducible gene I/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 pathways.\n Our data suggest that regulation of IRF-3-dependent innate antiviral defenses by PLpro may contribute to the establishment of SARS-CoV

Furthermore, high levels of macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1?, MIP-1?, and MIP-2 mRNA were observed at the onset of MHV-JHM infection and correlated with a marked elevation in the number of

syndrome (SARS) and that the SARS coronavirus (SARS?CoV) nucleoprotein is detectable in the lungs, and other organs and tissues, in these patients.\n In the present study, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays were used to analyse the expression of angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS?CoV spike (S) protein, and some pro?inflammatory cytokines (PICs) including MCP?1, TGF??1, TNF??, IL?1?, and IL?6 in autopsy tissues from four patients who died of SARS.\n SARS?CoV S protein and its RNA were only detected in ACE2+ cells in the lungs and other organs, indicating that ACE2?expressing cells are the primary targets for SARS?CoV infection in vivo in humans.\n High levels of PICs were expressed in the SARS?CoV?infected ACE2+ cells, but not in the uninfected cells.\n These results suggest that cells infected by SARS?CoV produce elevated levels of PICs which may cause immuno?mediated damage to the lungs and other organs, resulting in ALI and, subsequently, multi?organ dysfunction.\n Therefore application of PIC antagonists may reduce the severity and mortality of SARS.\n Copyright © 2006 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n

pathogenesis of SARS is highly complex, with multiple factors leading to severe injury in the lungs and dissemination of the virus to several other organs.\n The SARS coronavirus targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage.\n Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury.\n Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease.\n In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms.\n The latter include dysregulation of cytokines/chemokines, deficiencies in the innate immune response, direct infection of immune cells, direct viral cytopathic effects, down-regulation of lung protective angiotensin converting enzyme 2, autoimmunity, and genetic factors.\n It seems that both abnormal immune responses and injury to immune cells may

the ability of the virus to circumvent innate immunity.\n Using functional genomics, we analyzed early host responses to SARS-CoV infection in the lungs of adolescent cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that show lung pathology similar to that observed in human adults with SARS.\n Analysis of gene signatures revealed induction of a strong innate immune response characterized by the stimulation of various cytokine and chemokine genes, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IP-10, which corresponds to the host response seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n As opposed to many in vitro experiments, SARS-CoV induced a wide range of type I interferons (IFNs) and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in the lungs of macaques.\n Using immunohistochemistry, we revealed that these antiviral signaling pathways were differentially regulated in distinctive subsets of cells.\n Our studies emphasize that the induction of early IFN signaling may be critical to confer protection against SARS-CoV infection and highlight the strength of combining functional genomics with immunohistochemistry to further unravel the

effectiveness of treatment options.\n\n The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nIn response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients.\n\n We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria.\n\n In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria.\n\n Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture.\n\n In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm.\n\n Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive.\n\n In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm.\n\n\nConclusions\nDespite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak.\n\n Some may have been harmful.\n\n Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and to accrue data in real time during future outbreaks to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1564166","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lauren J","surname":"Stockman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Bellamy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Garner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Donald","surname":"Low","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Donald","surname":"Low","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.76.8.3697-3708.2002","date":"1970-01-01","title":"RNA replication of mouse hepatitis virus takes place at double-membrane vesicles","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.74.12.5647-5654.2000","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Mouse hepatitis virus replicase proteins associate with two distinct populations of intracellular membranes","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiology and cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong, People's Republic of China, in February, 2003","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological study on severe acute respiratory syndrome in Guangdong province","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Guangdong Public Health Office. 2003: Document No 2.

sensitivity for overcoming evolutionary divergence, so that large fractions of the metagenomic reads remain unclassified.\n Here we present the novel metagenome classifier Kaiju, which finds maximum (in-)exact matches on the protein-level using the Burrows–Wheeler transform.\n We show in a genome exclusion benchmark that Kaiju classifies reads with higher sensitivity and similar precision

sulphur cycle and atmospheric chemistry.\n Microorganisms using DMS as sole carbon, sulphur or energy source, contribute to the cycling of DMS in a wide variety of ecosystems.\n The diversity of microbial populations degrading DMS in terrestrial environments is poorly understood.\n Based on cultivation studies, a wide range of bacteria isolated from terrestrial ecosystems were shown to be able to degrade DMS, yet it remains unknown whether any of these have important roles in situ.\n In this study, we identified bacteria using DMS as a carbon and energy source in terrestrial environments, an agricultural soil and a lake sediment, by DNA stable isotope probing (SIP).\n Microbial communities involved in DMS degradation were analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, high-throughput sequencing of SIP gradient fractions and metagenomic sequencing of phi29-amplified community DNA.\n Labelling patterns of time course SIP experiments identified members of the Methylophilaceae family, not previously implicated in DMS degradation, as dominant DMS-degrading populations in soil and lake sediment.\n Thiobacillus spp.\n were also detected in 13C-DNA from SIP incubations.\n Metagenomic sequencing also suggested involvement of Methylophilaceae in DMS degradation and further indicated shifts in the functional profile of the DMS-assimilating communities in line with methylotrophy and oxidation of inorganic sulphur compounds.\n Overall, these data suggest that unlike in the marine environment where gammaproteobacterial populations were identified by SIP as DMS degraders, betaproteobacterial Methylophilaceae may have a key role in DMS cycling in terrestrial environments.\n","id":"PMC4611497","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Özge","surname":"Eyice","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Motonobu","surname":"Namura","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Mead","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Siva","surname":"Samavedam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hendrik","surname":"Schäfer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.future.2018.05.010","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Low-power

pathogenic organisms in a human sample.\n However, complete and accurate characterization of the sequence, including identification of any pathogens, depends on the availability and quality of genomes for comparison.\n Thousands of genomes are now available, and as these numbers grow, the power of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis should increase.\n However, recent studies have exposed the presence of contamination in published genomes, which when used for diagnosis increases the risk of falsely identifying the wrong pathogen.\n To address this problem, we have developed a bioinformatics system for eliminating contamination as well as low-complexity genomic sequences in the draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens.\n We applied this software to identify and remove human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences present in a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes.\n We also removed low-complexity genomic sequences, another source of false positives.\n Using this pipeline, we have produced a database of “clean” eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools.\n We demonstrate that when attempting to find eukaryotic pathogens in metagenomic samples, the new database provides better sensitivity than one using the original genomes while offering a dramatic reduction in false positives.\n","id":"PMC6034898","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jennifer","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Steven

towards shotgun metagenomic sequencing.\n Shotgun metagenomic data can be used to identify a wide range of species, but have rarely been applied to fungal identification.\n Here, we develop a sequence

identified Pseudogymnoascus species from 13 Antarctic soil samples initially analyzed for the presence of bacteria capable of degrading diesel oil.\n We also show that Candida tropicalis and Candida

for reconstructing genomes of facultative symbionts, such as lichen-forming fungi, from metagenomic reads.\n However, no study has so far tested accuracy and completeness of assemblies based on metagenomic sequences compared to assemblies based on pure culture strains of lichenized fungi.\n Here we assembled the genomes of Evernia prunastri and Pseudevernia furfuracea based on metagenomic

quality and completeness of the metagenome-based assemblies using genome assemblies as reference which are based on pure culture strains of the two fungal species.\n Our comparison showed that we were able to reconstruct fungal genomes from uncultured lichen thalli, and also cover most of the gene space (86–90%).\n Metagenome skimming will facilitate genome mining, comparative (phylo)genomics, and

cause of bacterial dysentery, Shigella represents a significant threat to public health and food safety.\n Related, but often overlooked, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) can also cause dysentery.\n Current typing methods have limited ability to identify and differentiate between these pathogens despite the need for rapid and accurate identification of pathogens for clinical treatment and outbreak response.\n We present a comprehensive phylogeny of Shigella and EIEC using whole genome sequencing of 169 samples, constituting unparalleled strain diversity, and observe a lack of monophyly between Shigella and EIEC and among Shigella taxonomic groups.\n The evolutionary relationships in the phylogeny are supported by analyses of population structure and hierarchical clustering patterns of translated gene homolog abundance.\n Lastly, we identified a panel of 254 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers specific to each phylogenetic cluster for more accurate identification of Shigella and EIEC.\n Our findings show that Shigella and EIEC are not distinct evolutionary groups within the E.\n coli genus and, thus, EIEC as a group is not the ancestor to Shigella.\n The multiple analyses presented provide evidence for reconsidering the taxonomic placement of Shigella.\n The SNP markers offer more discriminatory power to molecular epidemiological typing methods involving these bacterial pathogens.\n","id":"PMC4718091","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emily

multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) is the preferred method for establishing the phylogeny between species and genera.\n Four partial gene sequences of housekeeping genes (16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD) were obtained from 112 complete or draft genomes of strains related to the genus Pseudomonas that were available in databases.\n These genes were analyzed together with the corresponding sequences of 133 Pseudomonas type strains of validly published species to assess their correct phylogenetic assignations.\n We confirmed that 30% of the sequenced genomes of non-type strains were not correctly assigned at the species level in the accepted taxonomy of the genus and that 20% of the strains were not identified at the species level.\n Most of these strains had been isolated and classified several years ago, and their taxonomic status has not been updated by modern techniques.\n MLSA was also compared with indices based on the analysis of whole-genome sequences that have been proposed for species delineation, such as tetranucleotide usage patterns (TETRA), average nucleotide identity (ANIm, based on MUMmer and ANIb, based on BLAST) and genome-to-genome distance (GGDC).\n TETRA was useful for discriminating Pseudomonas from other genera, whereas ANIb and GGDC clearly separated strains of different species.\n ANIb showed the strongest correlation with MLSA.\n The correct species classification is a prerequisite for most diversity and evolutionary studies.\n This work highlights the necessity for complete genomic sequences of type strains to build a

from Mexico","abstract":"Bats are reservoirs for a wide range of human pathogens including Nipah, Hendra, rabies, Ebola, Marburg and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV).\n The recent implication of a novel beta (?)-CoV as the cause of fatal respiratory disease in the Middle East emphasizes the importance of surveillance for CoVs that have potential to move from bats into the human population.\n In a screen of 606 bats from 42 different species in Campeche, Chiapas and Mexico City we identified 13 distinct CoVs.\n Nine were alpha (?)-CoVs; four were ?-CoVs.\n Twelve were novel.\n Analyses of these viruses in the context of their hosts and ecological habitat indicated that host species is a strong selective driver in CoV evolution, even in allopatric populations separated by significant geographical distance; and that a single species/genus of bat can contain multiple CoVs.\n A ?-CoV with 96.5?% amino acid identity to the ?-CoV associated with human disease in the Middle East was found in a Nyctinomops laticaudatus bat, suggesting that efforts to identify the viral reservoir should include surveillance of the bat families Molossidae/Vespertilionidae, or the closely related Nycteridae/Emballonuridae.\n While it is important to investigate unknown viral diversity in bats, it is also important to remember that the majority of viruses they carry will not pose any clinical risk, and bats should not be stigmatized ubiquitously as significant threats to public health.\n","id":"PMC3709589","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"S.

Smaller S protein fragments, expressing residues 327–510 or 318–490, did not detectably bind ACE2. A point mutation at aspartic acid 454 abolished association of the full S1 domain and of the 193-residue fragment with ACE2. The 193-residue fragment blocked S protein-mediated infection with an IC50 of less than 10 nm, whereas the IC50 of the S1 domain was ?50 nm.\n These data identify an independently folded

N and Its Inhibition by Neutralizing Antibodies","abstract":"The coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses of animals and humans associated mostly with enteric and respiratory diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome and 10–20% of all common colds.\n A subset of CoVs uses the cell surface aminopeptidase N (APN), a membrane-bound metalloprotease, as a cell entry receptor.\n In these viruses, the envelope spike glycoprotein (S) mediates the attachment of the virus particles to APN and subsequent cell entry, which can be blocked by neutralizing antibodies.\n Here we describe the crystal structures of the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of two closely related CoV strains, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV), in complex with their receptor, porcine APN (pAPN), or with a neutralizing antibody.\n The data provide detailed information on the architecture of the dimeric pAPN ectodomain and its interaction with the CoV S.\n We show that a protruding receptor-binding edge in the S determines virus-binding specificity for recessed glycan-containing surfaces in the membrane-distal region of the pAPN ectodomain.\n Comparison of the RBDs of TGEV and PRCV to those of other related CoVs, suggests that the conformation of the S receptor-binding region determines cell entry receptor specificity.\n Moreover, the receptor-binding edge is a major antigenic determinant in the TGEV envelope S that is targeted by neutralizing antibodies.\n Our results provide a compelling view on CoV cell entry and immune neutralization, and may aid

These two regions are understood to form a fusion-active conformation similar to those of other typical viral fusion proteins.\n This hairpin structure likely juxtaposes the viral and cellular

was determined at 2.8 Å of resolution.\n The fusion core is a six-helix bundle with three HR2 helices packed against the hydrophobic grooves on the surface of central coiled coil formed by three

(MERS-CoV), are suggested to be originated from bats.\n Various species of horseshoe bats in China have been found to harbor genetically diverse SARS-like coronaviruses.\n Some strains are highly similar to SARS-CoV even in the spike protein and are able to use the same receptor as SARS-CoV for cell entry.\n On the other hand, diverse coronaviruses phylogenetically related to MERS-CoV have been discovered worldwide in a wide range of bat species, some of which can be classified to the same coronavirus species as MERS-CoV.\n Coronaviruses genetically related to human coronavirus 229E and NL63 have been detected in bats as well.\n Moreover, intermediate hosts are believed to play an important role in the transmission and emergence of these coronaviruses from bats to humans.\n Understanding the bat origin of human coronaviruses is helpful for the prediction and prevention of another pandemic emergence in the future.\n","id":"PMC4687304","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xingyi","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhengli","surname":"Shi","email":"zlshi@wh.iov.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41598-017-11384-w","date":"2017-08-23","title":"Virome

of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus","abstract":"A large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been detected in horseshoe bats since 2005 in different areas of China.\n However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV.\n Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China.\n The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei-Ping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Yi","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia-Zheng","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Zhi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong-Sheng","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Niang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/ismej.2015.138","date":"2015-07-08","title":"Deciphering

2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak.\n Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different

MERS-CoV spike protein and form a species barrier to infection.\n To better understand the species adaptability of MERS-CoV, we identified a suboptimal species-derived variant of DPP4 to study viral adaption.\n Passaging virus on cells expressing this DPP4 variant led to accumulation of mutations in the viral spike which increased replication.\n Parallel passages revealed distinct paths of viral adaptation to the same DPP4 variant.\n Structural analysis and functional assays showed that these mutations enhanced viral entry with suboptimal DPP4 by altering the surface charge of spike.\n These
