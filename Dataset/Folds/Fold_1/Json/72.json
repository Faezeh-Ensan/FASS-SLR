between groups were compared.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P&lt;0.05).\n\n Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P&lt;0.05).\n\n After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P&lt;0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.\n\n\nConclusion\nNearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization.\n\n The patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184444","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Oxford University

ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows.\n\n Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support.\n\n Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions.\n\n Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits.\n\n Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis.\n\n The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging.\n\n Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147277","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Wolters Kluwer Health","authors":[{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yan","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Wei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Mei-Fang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jing-Ping","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Wei","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ying-Nan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Min-Hua","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Cheng-Hong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Guang-Cai","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Hui-Guo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Xiu-Yuan","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Xiu-Yuan","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Pei-Fang","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s11427-020-1643-8","date":"2020-02-08","title":"Clinical and biochemical indexes from 2019-nCoV infected patients linked to viral loads and lung injury","abstract":"Electronic Supplementary Material\nSupplementary material is available for this article at 10.1007/s11427-020-1643-8 and is accessible for authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7088566","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Science China Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Yingxia","surname":"Liu","email":"yingxialiu@hotmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Cong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Fengming","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Fuxiang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jing","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Zhaoqin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jinxiu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jianming","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Cheng","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Zheng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Lifei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ling","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Li","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yuhao","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Dandan","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Shuguang","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Lu","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jun","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Congzhao","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Chengyu","surname":"Jiang","email":"jiang@pumc.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"liulei3322@aliyun.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

and considerable differences in disease severity and mortality rate of patients treated in Hubei province compared to those in other parts of China have been observed.\n\n We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these differences.\n\n\nMethods\nCollaborating with the National Health Commission, we established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalised COVID-19 cases in China.\n\n Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and the time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients within and outside Hubei.\n\n The impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed key factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicentre as well the administrative centre of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission on prognosis were also determined.\n\n\nResults\nAt the data cut-off (31 January 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort).\n\n The overall rate of severe cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively.\n\n Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597 (92.3%) out of 647) were older (mean age 49.7 versus 44.9?years), had more cases with comorbidity (32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5?days) compared with patients outside Hubei.\n\n Patients in Hubei (severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, HR (95% CI) for critical illness 1.59 (1.05–2.41)) have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity.\n\n However, among patients outside Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean 4.4 versus 4.7?days) and prognosis (HR (95%) 0.84 (0.40–1.80)) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure.\n\n In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in Hubei nor Wuhan-related exposure, remained an independent prognostic factor (HR (95%) 1.05 (1.01–1.08)).\n\n\nConclusion\nThere were more severe cases and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 patients treated in Hubei, which might be attributed to the prolonged duration of symptom onset to hospitalisation in the epicentre.\n\n Future studies to determine the reason for delaying hospitalisation are warranted.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7144336","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"European Respiratory

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

covid-19 were analysed.\n\n Data were collected until 28 February 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)).\n\n The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days.\n\n Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively.\n\n Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\n\n Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%).\n\n Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications.\n\n Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk.\n\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7190011","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"
