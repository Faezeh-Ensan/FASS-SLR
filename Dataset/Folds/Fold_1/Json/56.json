developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation on day 5 of disease onset.\n The patient underwent a cesarean delivery, and neonatal isolation was implemented immediately after birth, without delayed cord clamping or skin-to-skin contact.\n The neonatal nasopharyngeal swab, 16?hours after delivery, was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunoglobulin (Ig)-M and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 were negative.\n Maternal IgM and IgG were positive on postpartum day 4 (day 9 after symptom onset).\n We report a severe presentation of COVID-19 during pregnancy.\n To our knowledge, this is the earliest reported positive PCR in the neonate, raising the concern for vertical transmission.\n We suggest

SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Northern Italy","abstract":"Background:\nFrom February 20 to April 2020, the coronavirus SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 spread in northern Italy, drastically challenging the care capacities of the national health care system.\n\n Unprepared for this emergency, hospitals have quickly reformulated paths of assistance in an effort to guarantee treatment for infected patients.\n\n Orthopaedic departments have been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).\n\n The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that operative treatment may contribute to the overall stability of the patient.\n\n\nMethods:\nSixteen patients affected by proximal femoral fracture and a recent history of fever, shortness of breath, and desaturation were admitted to the emergency room.\n\n Thoracic computed tomography (CT) and oropharyngeal swabs confirmed that they were positive for COVID-19, requiring hospitalization and prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin.\n\n\nResults:\nThree patients died before surgery because of severe respiratory insufficiency and multiple-organ-failure syndrome.\n\n Ten patients underwent surgery on the day after admission, whereas 3 patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after admission.\n\n In all patients except 1, we noted an improvement in terms of O2 saturation and assisted respiration.\n\n In 9 patients, hemodynamic and respiratory stability was observed at an average of 7 days postoperatively.\n\n Four patients who underwent surgical treatment died of respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (1 patient), the third day after surgery (2 patients), or the seventh day after surgery (1 patient).\n\n\nConclusions:\nWe noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures.\n\n We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed.\n\n\nLevel of Evidence:\nPrognostic Level IV.\n\n See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7224593","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery,

recovery needs to be understood to inform clinical decision making during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n This study reports 30-day mortality and pulmonary complication rates in patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThis international, multicentre, cohort study at 235 hospitals in 24 countries included all patients undergoing surgery who had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed within 7 days before or 30 days after surgery.\n\n The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality and was assessed in all enrolled patients.\n\n The main secondary outcome measure was pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or unexpected postoperative ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nThis analysis includes 1128 patients who had surgery between Jan 1 and March 31, 2020, of whom 835 (74·0%) had emergency surgery and 280 (24·8%) had elective surgery.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed preoperatively in 294 (26·1%) patients.\n\n 30-day mortality was 23·8% (268 of 1128).\n\n Pulmonary complications occurred in 577 (51·2%) of 1128 patients; 30-day mortality in these patients was 38·0% (219 of 577), accounting for 81·7% (219 of 268) of all deaths.\n\n In adjusted analyses, 30-day mortality was associated with male sex (odds ratio 1·75 [95% CI 1·28–2·40], p&lt;0·0001), age 70 years or older versus younger than 70 years (2·30 [1·65–3·22], p&lt;0·0001), American Society of Anesthesiologists grades 3–5 versus grades 1–2 (2·35 [1·57–3·53], p&lt;0·0001), malignant versus benign or obstetric diagnosis (1·55 [1·01–2·39], p=0·046), emergency versus elective surgery (1·67 [1·06–2·63], p=0·026), and major versus minor surgery (1·52 [1·01–2·31], p=0·047).\n\n\nInterpretation\nPostoperative pulmonary complications occur in half of patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with high mortality.\n\n Thresholds for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic should be higher than during normal practice, particularly in men aged 70 years and older.\n\n Consideration should be given for postponing non-urgent procedures and promoting non-operative treatment to delay or avoid the need for surgery.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland, Bowel and Cancer Research, Bowel Disease Research Foundation,
