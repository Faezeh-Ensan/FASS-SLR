Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/jth.14859","date":"2020-04-10","title":"D?dimer levels on admission to predict in?hospital mortality in patients with Covid?19","abstract":"Background\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid?19) has shown a global spreading trend.\n\n Early and effective predictors of clinical outcomes are urgently needed to improve management of Covid?19 patients.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate whether elevated D?dimer levels could predict mortality in patients with Covid?19.\nMethods\nPatients with laboratory confirmed Covid?19 were retrospective enrolled in Wuhan Asia General Hospital from January 12, 2020, to March 15, 2020.

laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19).\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 3 and February 1, 2020 were included.\n\n All those patients were with laboratory-confirmed infection.\n\n Epidemiological, clinical, radiological characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory tests treatment, complications and outcomes data were collected.\n\n Outcomes were followed up at discharge until Feb 15, 2020.\nResults\nThe study cohort included 102 adult patients.\n\n The median (IQR) age was 54 years (37-67years) and 48.0% were female.\n\n A total of 34 patients (33.3%) were exposed to source of transmission in the hospital setting (as health care workers, patients, or visitors) and 10 patients (9.8%) had a familial cluster.\n\n Eighteen patients (17.6%) were admitted to the ICU, and 17 patients died (mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.4%-23.9%).\n\n Among patients who survived, they were younger, more likely were health care workers and less likely suffered from comorbidities.\n\n They were also less likely suffered from complications.\n\n There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the survival and non-survival groups.\n\n Patients who survived less likely required admission to the intensive care unit (14.1% vs.\n\n 35.3%).\n\n Chest imaging examination showed that death patients more likely had ground-glass opacity (41.2% vs.\n\n 12.9%).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe mortality rate was high among the COVID-19 patients described in our cohort who met our criteria for inclusion in this analysis.\n\n Patient characteristics seen more frequently in those who died were development of systemic complications following onset of the illness and the severity of disease requiring admission to the ICU.\n\n Our data support those described by others that COVID-19 infection results from human-to-human transmission, including familial clustering of cases, and nosocomial transmission.\n\n There were no differences in mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid drug treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184479","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Oxford University

collected until 28 February 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)).\n\n The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days.\n\n Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was

N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\n\n Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35;

infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk.\n\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7190011","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing
