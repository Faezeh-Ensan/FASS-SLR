pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7523417","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"International Scientific Literature,

and distribution of genotypes","abstract":"With the improvements of sanitation and nationwide safe water supply the occurrence of bacterial diarrhea declined remarkably, while viruses became the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis (AGE).\n Of these viruses, noroviruses (NoVs) are responsible for a considerable burden of gastroenteritis, especially in children &lt; 2 years and elderly ? 65 years.\n NoVs circulating in the Chinese population are antigenically highly diverse with the genotype GII.\n4 being the dominant strain followed by GII.\n3. Given the widespread contamination in environmental sources, and highly infectious nature of NoVs, vaccination would be the desirable strategy for the control of NoV infections.\n However, a better understanding of acquired immunity after infection, and a reliable immunological surrogate marker are urgently needed, since two vaccine candidates based on virus-like particles (VLPs) are currently moving into clinical evaluations in China.\n","id":"PMC8320309","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Higher Education Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Honglu","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Songmei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Lorenz","surname":"von Seidlein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Xuanyi","surname":"Wang","email":"xywang@shmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15143","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Unknown Title","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jinf.2020.08.014","date":"2020-08-08","title":"In-hospital use of ACEI/ARB is associated with lower risk of mortality and critic illness in COVID-19 patients with hypertension","abstract":"","id":"PMC7422860","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"The British Infection Association.

All study cases were grouped according to whether they had a history of hypertension.\n Then, a subgroup analysis for all hypertensive patients was carried out based on whether to take ACEI or ARB drugs.\n The mean age of 110 patients was 57.7 years (range, 25–86 years), of which 60 (54.5%) were male patients.\n The main underlying diseases included hypertension [36 (32.7%)] and diabetes [11 (10.0%)].\n Compared with the non-hypertensive group, the lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the hypertensive group (average value, 0.96 × 109/L vs 1.26 × 109/L), and analysis of clinical outcomes showed that the crude mortality rate was higher in the hypertensive group [7/36 (19.4%) vs 2/74 (2.7%)].\n Patients treated with ACEI or ARB, compared with the control group, were younger (average age, 58.5 years vs 69.2 years), but there was no statistical difference in the crude cure rate [10/15 (66.7%) vs 15/21 (71.4%)] and the crude mortality rate [2/15 (13.3%) vs 5/21 (23.8%)].\n In conclusions, the COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension had a significantly lower lymphocyte count on admission.\n The elderly and comorbidities such as hypertension may together constitute risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.
