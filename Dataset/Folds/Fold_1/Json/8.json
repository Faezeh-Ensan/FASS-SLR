This interaction has been proposed as a potential risk factor in patients treated with RAAS inhibitors.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis study analyzed whether RAAS inhibitors modify the risk for COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe RASTAVI (Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade Benefits in Clinical Evolution and Ventricular Remodeling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial is an ongoing randomized clinical trial randomly allocating subjects to ramipril or control groups after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement at 14 centers in Spain.\n\n A non-pre-specified interim analysis was performed to evaluate ramipril’s impact on COVID-19 risk in this vulnerable population.\n\n\nResults\nAs of April 1, 2020, 102 patients (50 in the ramipril group and 52 in the control group) were included in the trial.\n\n Mean age was 82.3 ± 6.1 years, 56.9% of the participants were male.\n\n Median time of ramipril treatment was 6 months (interquartile range: 2.9 to 11.4 months).\n\n Eleven patients (10.8%) have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (6 in control group and 5 receiving ramipril; hazard ratio: 1.150; 95% confidence interval: 0.351 to 3.768).\n\n The risk of COVID-19 was increased in older patients (p = 0.019) and those with atrial fibrillation (p = 0.066), lower hematocrit (p = 0.084), and more comorbidities according to Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (p = 0.065).\n\n Admission and oxygen supply was required in 4.9% of patients (2 in the ramipril group and 3 in the control group), and 4 of them died (2 in each randomized group).\n\n A higher body mass index was the only factor increasing the mortality rate (p = 0.039).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn a high-risk population of older patients with cardiovascular disease, randomization to ramipril had no impact on the incidence or severity of COVID-19. This analysis supports the maintenance of RAAS inhibitor treatment during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n (Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade Benefits in Clinical Evolution and Ventricular Remodeling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation [RASTAVI]; NCT03201185)\n","id":"PMC7250557","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not increase the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n On the other hand, conflicting findings regarding the role of ACEIs/ARBs as prognosis modifiers in COVID-19 hospitalised patients have been reported.\n\n\nObjective\nid='Par2'>The aim of this large-scale, retrospective cohort study was to investigate whether prior exposure to ACEIs and/or ARBs was associated with all-cause mortality among over 40,000 hospitalised COVID-19 patients compared with calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a potential therapeutic alternative.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par3'>This study was conducted using COVID-19 registries linked to claims databases from Lombardy, Veneto and Reggio Emilia (overall, 25% of Italian population).\n\n Overall, 42,926 patients hospitalised between 21 February and 21 April 2020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction tests were included in this study.\n\n All-cause mortality occurring in or out of hospital, as reported in the COVID-19 registry, was estimated.\n\n Using Cox models, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality (along with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were estimated separately for ACEIs/ARBs and other antihypertensives versus CCBs and non-use.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par4'>Overall, 11,205 in- and out-of-hospital deaths occurred over a median of 24 days of follow-up after hospital admission due to COVID-19. Compared with CCBs, adjusted analyses showed no difference in the risk of death among ACEI (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89–1.06) or ARB (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89–1.06) users.\n\n When non-use of antihypertensives was considered as a comparator, a modest statistically significant increase in mortality risk was observed for any antihypertensive use.\n\n However, when restricting to drugs with antihypertensive indications only, these marginal increases disappeared.\n\n Sensitivity and subgroup analyses confirmed our main findings.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par5'>ACEI/ARB use is not associated with either an increased or decreased risk of all-cause mortality, compared with CCB use, in the largest cohort of hospitalised COVID-19 patients exposed to these drugs studied to date.\n\n The use of these drugs therefore does not affect the prognosis of COVID-19. This finding strengthens recommendations of international regulatory agencies about not withdrawing/switching ACEI/ARB treatments to modify COVID-19 prognosis.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s40264-020-00994-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7450482","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Springer International Publishing","authors":[{"firstname":"Gianluca","surname":"Trifirò","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Marco","surname":"Massari","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":" Marco","surname":"Massari","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Roberto","surname":"Da Cas","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Francesca","surname":"Menniti Ippolito","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Janet","surname":"Sultana","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Salvatore","surname":"Crisafulli","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Paolo","surname":"Giorgi Rossi","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":" Massimiliano","surname":"Marino","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Manuel","surname":"Zorzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Emanuela","surname":"Bovo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Olivia","surname":"Leoni","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Monica","surname":"Ludergnani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Stefania","surname":"Spila Alegiani","email":"stefania.spila@iss.it","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Stefania","surname":"Spila Alegiani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Francesca","surname":"Menniti Ippolito","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Roberto","surname":"Da Cas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Marco","surname":"Massari","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Giuseppe","surname":"Traversa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Graziano","surname":"Onder","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Gianluca","surname":"Trifirò","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Janet","surname":"Sultana","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Valentina","surname":"Ientile","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Salvatore","surname":"Crisafulli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Paolo","surname":"Giorgi Rossi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Roberto","surname":"Grilli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Giulio","surname":"Formoso","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Massimiliano","surname":"Marino","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Massimo","surname":"Vicentini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Olivia","surname":"Leoni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Monica","surname":"Ludergnani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Danilo","surname":"Cereda","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Eliana","surname":"Ferroni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Stefano","surname":"Guzzinati","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Emanuela","surname":"Bovo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Manuel","surname":"Zorzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Massimo","surname":"Gion","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s11684-020-0800-y","date":"2020-06-03","title":"Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in context of COVID-19 outbreak: a retrospective analysis","abstract":"The possible effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on COVID-19 disease severity have generated considerable debate.\n We performed a single-center, retrospective analysis of hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, who had definite clinical outcome (dead or discharged) by February 15, 2020.
