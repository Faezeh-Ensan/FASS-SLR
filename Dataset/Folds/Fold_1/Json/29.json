settings: A systematic review of quantitative evidence","abstract":"Introduction\nStigma and discrimination (SAD) related to HIV compromise access and adherence to treatment and support programs among people living with HIV (PLHIV).\n\n The ambitious goal of ending the epidemic of HIV by 2030 set by the United Nations Joint Program of HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) will thus only be achieved if HIV-related stigma and discrimination are reduced.\n\n The objective of this review was to locate, appraise and describe international literature reporting on interventions that addressed HIV-related SAD in healthcare settings.\n\n\nMethods\nThe databases searched were: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Excerpta Medica Database from Elsevier (EMBASE), PubMed and Psychological Information (PsycINFO) database.\n\n Two individuals independently appraised the quality of the papers using appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI).\n\n Data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI.\n\n Quality of evidence for major outcomes was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).\n\n\nResults\nWe retained 14 records reporting on eight studies.\n\n Five categories of SAD reduction (information-based, skills building, structural, contact-based and biomedical interventions) were identified.\n\n Training popular opinion leaders (POLs) resulted in significantly lower mean avoidance intent scores (MD = -1.87 [95% CI -2.05 to -1.69]), mean prejudicial attitude scores (MD = -3.77 [95% CI -5.4 to -2.09]) and significantly higher scores in mean compliance to universal precaution (MD = 1.65 [95% CI 1.41 to 1.89]) when compared to usual care (moderate quality evidence).\n\n The Summary of Findings table (SOF) is shown in Table 1.\n\n\nConclusions\nEvidence of moderate quality indicates that training popular opinion leaders is effective in reducing avoidance intent and prejudicial attitude and improving compliance to universal precaution.\n\n Very low quality evidence indicates that professionally-assisted peer group interventions, modular interactive training, participatory self-guided assessment and intervention, contact strategy combined with information giving and empowerment are effective in reducing HIV-related stigma.\n\nFurther Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are needed.\n\n Future trials need to use up-to-date and validated instruments to measure stigma and discrimination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6347272","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Garumma

at the workplace: a systematic review","abstract":"Background\nThe majority of people experiencing mental-health problems do not seek help, and the stigma of mental illness is considered a major barrier to seeking appropriate treatment.\n\n More targeted interventions (e.\n\ng.\n\n at the workplace) seem to be a promising and necessary supplement to public campaigns, but little is known about their effectiveness.\n\n The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions targeting the stigma of mental illness at the workplace.\n\n\nMethods\nSixteen studies were included after the literature review.\n\n The effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions at the workplace was assessed by examining changes in: (1) knowledge of mental disorders and their treatment and recognition of signs/symptoms of mental illness, (2) attitudes towards people with mental-health problems, and (3) supportive behavior.\n\n\nResults\nThe results indicate that anti-stigma interventions at the workplace can lead to improved employee knowledge and supportive behavior towards people with mental-health problems.\n\n The effects of interventions on employees’ attitudes were mixed, but generally positive.\n\n The quality of evidence varied across studies.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis highlights the need for more rigorous, higher-quality evaluations conducted with more diverse samples of the working population.\n\n Future research should explore to what extent changes in employees’ knowledge, attitudes, and supportive behavior lead to affected individuals seeking help earlier.\n\n Such investigations are likely to inform important stakeholders about the potential benefits of current workplace anti-stigma interventions and provide guidance for the development and implementation of effective future interventions.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article
