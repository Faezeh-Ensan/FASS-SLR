one is flooding.\n\n Long and heavy rainfall during the last days of October and the first week of November 2008 resulted in a devastating flood unseen for over three decades in the capital city of Hanoi.\n\n It caused a substantial health impact on residents in and around the city and compromised the capacity of local health services.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study is to ascertain the vulnerability and health impacts of the devastating flood in Hanoi by identifying the differences in mortality, injuries, and morbidity patterns (dengue, pink eye, dermatitis, psychological problems, and hypertension) between flood affected and non-affected households.\n\n\nDesign\nA cross-sectional study was carried out involving 871 households in four selected communes (two heavily flood affected and two comparatively less affected) from two severely flooded districts of Hanoi.\n\n Participants were interviewed and information collected on the social, economic, and health impacts of the devastation within 1 month after the flood.\n\n\nResults\nThe self-reported number of deaths and injuries reported in this study within 1 month after the heavy rainfall were a bit higher in severely affected communes as compared to that of the less affected communes of our study.\n\n The findings showed higher incidences of dengue fever, pink eye, dermatitis, and psychological problems in communes severely affected by flood as compared to that of the controlled communes.\n\n\nConclusions\nFor people in flood prone areas (at risk for flooding), flood prevention and mitigation strategies need to be seriously thought through and acted upon, as these people are exposed to greater health problems such as psychological issues and communicable diseases such as pink eye or dermatitis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3160808","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"CoAction Publishing","authors":[{"firstname":"Tran
