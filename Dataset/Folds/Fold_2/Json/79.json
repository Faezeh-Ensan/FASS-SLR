a dose of 2360 J/cm2 reduced the breaking strength of the straps by 20–51%.\n Our results suggest that UVGI could be used to effectively disinfect disposable respirators for reuse, but the maximum number of disinfection cycles will be limited by the respirator model and the UVGI dose required to inactivate the pathogen.\n","id":"PMC4699414","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Taylor &amp;

if a severe pandemic occurs, and an option that has been suggested for mitigating such an FFR shortage is to decontaminate and reuse the devices.\n Before the effectiveness of this strategy can be established, many parameters affecting respiratory protection must be measured: biocidal efficacy of the decontamination treatment, filtration performance, pressure drop, fit, and toxicity to the end user post treatment.\n This research effort measured the amount of residual chemicals created or deposited on six models of FFRs following treatment by each of 7 simple decontamination technologies.\n Measured amounts of decontaminants retained by the FFRs treated with chemical disinfectants were small enough that exposure to wearers will be below the permissible exposure limit (PEL).\n Toxic by-products were also evaluated, and two suspected toxins were detected after ethylene oxide treatment of FFR rubber straps.\n The results provide encouragement to efforts promoting the evolution of

masks—N95, Gauze and Spunlace nonwoven masks.\n Newly developed evaluation methods, the overall filter quality (qf,o) and the qf ratio were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of decontamination methods for respirators.\n A scanning mobility particle sizer is utilized to measure the concentration of polydispersed particles with diameter 14.6–594 nm.\n The penetration of particles and pressure drop (?p) through the mask are used to determine qf and qf,o.\n Experimental results reveal that the most penetrating particle size (MPS) for the pre-decontaminated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks were 118 nm, 461 nm and 279 nm, respectively, and the respective penetration rates were 2.6%, 23.2% and 70.0%.\n The ?p through the pretreated N95 masks was 9.2 mm H2O at the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers, exceeding the ?p values obtained through Gauze and Spunlace masks.\n Decontamination increased the sizes of the most penetrating particles, changing the qf values of all of the masks: qf fell as particle size increased because the penetration increased.\n Bleach increased the ?p of N95, but destroyed the Gauze mask.\n However, the use of an autoclave reduces the ?p values of both the N95 and the Gauze mask.\n Neither the rice cooker nor ethanol altered the ?p of the Gauze mask.\n Chemical decontamination methods reduced the qf,o values for the three electret masks.\n The value of qf,o for PM0.1 exceeded that for PM0.1–0.6, because particles smaller than 100 nm had lower penetration, resulting in a better qf for a given pressure drop.\n The values of qf,o, particularly for PM0.1, reveal that for the tested treatments and masks, physical decontamination methods are less destructive to the filter than chemical methods.\n Nevertheless, when purchasing new or reusing FFRs, penetration should be regarded as the priority.\n","id":"PMC5638397","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Public Library of
