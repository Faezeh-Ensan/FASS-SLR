‘COVID-19-free’) trauma and orthopaedic service for the management of hip fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK","abstract":"Aims\nHip fracture patients are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness, and admission into hospital puts them at further risk.\n\n We implemented a two-site orthopaedic trauma service, with ‘COVID’ and ‘COVID-free’ hubs, to deliver urgent and infection-controlled trauma care for hip fracture patients, while increasing bed capacity for medical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nMethods\nA vacated private elective surgical centre was repurposed to facilitate a two-site, ‘COVID’ and ‘COVID-free’, hip fracture service.\n\n Patients were screened for COVID-19 infection and either kept at our ‘COVID’ site or transferred to our ‘COVID-free’ site.\n\n We collected data for 30 days on patient demographics, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), Nottingham Hip Fracture Scores (NHFS), time to surgery, COVID-19 status, mortality, and length of stay (LOS).\n\n\nResults\nIn all, 47 hip fracture patients presented to our service: 12 were admitted to the ‘COVID’ site and 35 to the ‘COVID-free’ site.\n\n The ‘COVID’ site cohort were older (mean 86.8 vs 78.5 years, p = 0.0427) and with poorer CFS (p = 0.0147) and NHFS (p = 0.0023) scores.\n\n At the ‘COVID-free’ site, mean time to surgery was less (29.8 vs 52.8 hours, p = 0.0146), and mean LOS seemed shorter (8.7 vs 12.6 days, p = 0.0592).\n\n No patients tested positive for COVID-19 infection while at the ‘COVID-free’ site.\n\n We redirected 74% of our admissions from the base ‘COVID’ site and created 304 inpatient days’ capacity for medical COVID patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nAcquisition of unused elective orthopaedic capacity from the private sector facilitated a two-site trauma service.\n\n Patients were treated expeditiously, while successfully achieving strict infection control.\n\n We achieved significant gains in medical bed capacity in response to the COVID-19 demand.\n\n The authors propose the repurposing of unused elective operating facilities for a two-site ‘COVID’ and ‘COVID-free’ model as a safe and effective way of managing hip fracture patients during the pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7677720","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"The British Editorial Society of Bone and Joint
