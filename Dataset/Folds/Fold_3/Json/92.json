Clinical characteristics and early postoperative outcomes were reported.\n\n\nResults\nEight out of the 10 COVID-positive hip fracture patients in our series were asymptomatic on admission with no clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection.\n\n Only 2 patients presented with hypoxia.\n\n All 10 patients underwent surgery within 2 days of admission.\n\n Five out of the 10 patients – including the patients who presented with hypoxia – subsequently required supplemental oxygen postoperatively.\n\n Two patients had persistently elevated oxygen demands requiring prolonged administration of supplemental oxygen therapy beyond postoperative day 3. None of the patients were put on mechanical ventilation.\n\n One patient had a presumed venous thromboembolism postoperatively and subsequently died on postoperative day 19, likely due to respiratory failure.\n\n There were no other deaths in the early postoperative period.\n\n The average length of inpatient stay was 7.8 days.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that hip fracture patients who present with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection may have temporarily increased oxygen demands postoperatively, but they can safely undergo early surgical intervention after appropriate medical optimization.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7274993","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Zoe B.","surname":"Cheung","email":"zoe.cheung@mountsinai.org","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" David A.","surname":"Forsh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1302/0301-620X.102B9.BJJ-2020-1100.R1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Unknown Title","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1302/0301-620X.102B9.BJJ-2020-1127.R1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Unknown Title","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]}
