Adverse events were higher in hydroxychloroquine recipients than in non-recipients.\n\n\nTrial registration\nChiCTR2000029868.\n","id":"PMC7221473","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"BMJ

COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial","abstract":"Background\nChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients.\n\n We evaluate the effect of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads.\n\n\nPatients and methods\nFrench Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting.\n\n Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment.\n\n Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls.\n\n Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point.\n\n\nResults\nSix patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms.\n\n\nConclusion\nDespite its small sample size, our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102549","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Published by Elsevier
