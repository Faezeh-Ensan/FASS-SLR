mucosal exposure to sweat contaminated with MERS-CoV; and contamination during doffing of personal protective equipment.\n\n The MERS guidelines should reflect this case to decrease the risk of infection during CPR.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5733382","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Korean Society of Epidemiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Hae-Sung","surname":"Nam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Mi-Yeon","surname":"Yeon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Mi-Yeon","surname":"Yeon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jung Wan","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jung Wan","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jee-Young","surname":"Hong","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Jee-Young","surname":"Hong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ji Woong","surname":"Son","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Ji Woong","surname":"Son","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1002.030700","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Possible SARS Coronavirus Transmission during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation","abstract":"Infection of healthcare workers with the severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is thought to occur primarily by either contact or large respiratory droplet transmission.\n However, infrequent healthcare worker infections occurred despite the use of contact and droplet precautions, particularly during certain aerosol-generating medical procedures.\n We investigated a possible cluster of SARS-CoV infections in healthcare workers who used contact and droplet precautions during attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a SARS patient.\n Unlike previously reported instances of transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, the index case-patient was unresponsive, and the intubation procedure was performed quickly and without difficulty.\n However, before intubation, the patient was ventilated with a bag-valve-mask that may have contributed to aerosolization of SARS-CoV.\n On the basis of the results of this investigation and previous reports of SARS transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, a systematic approach to the problem is outlined, including the use of the following: 1) administrative controls, 2) environmental engineering controls, 3) personal protective equipment, and 4) quality control.\n","id":"PMC3322904","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael D.","surname":"Christian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Mona","surname":"Loutfy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" L.
