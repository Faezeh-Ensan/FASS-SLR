The state is now the epicenter of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in the United States, with 84,735 cases reported as of April 2, 2020. We previously presented an early case series with 7 coronavirus disease 2019–positive pregnant patients, 2 of whom were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 after an initial asymptomatic presentation.\n We now describe a series of 43 test-positive cases of coronavirus disease 2019 presenting to an affiliated pair of New York City hospitals for more than 2 weeks, from March 13, 2020, to March 27, 2020. A total of 14 patients (32.6%) presented without any coronavirus disease 2019–associated viral symptoms and were identified after they developed symptoms during admission or after the implementation of universal testing for all obstetric admissions on March 22. Among them, 10 patients (71.4%) developed symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 over the course of their delivery admission or early after postpartum discharge.\n Of the other 29 patients (67.4%) who presented with symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019, 3 women ultimately required antenatal admission for viral symptoms, and another patient re-presented with worsening respiratory status requiring oxygen supplementation 6 days postpartum after a successful labor induction.\n There were no confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 detected in neonates upon initial testing on the first day of life.\n Based on coronavirus disease 2019 disease severity characteristics by Wu and McGoogan, 37 women (86%) exhibited mild disease, 4 (9.3%) severe disease, and 2 (4.7%) critical disease; these percentages are similar to those described in nonpregnant adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (about 80% mild, 15% severe, and 5% critical disease).\n","id":"PMC7144599","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Noelle","surname":"Breslin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

utero infection and early positive neonatal testing.\n A 41-year-old G3P2 with a history of previous cesarean deliveries and diabetes mellitus presented with a 4-day history of malaise, low-grade fever, and progressive shortness of breath.\n A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 serology was negative.\n The patient developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation on day 5 of disease onset.\n The patient underwent a cesarean delivery, and neonatal isolation was implemented immediately after birth, without delayed cord clamping or skin-to-skin contact.\n The neonatal nasopharyngeal swab, 16?hours after delivery, was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunoglobulin (Ig)-M and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 were negative.\n Maternal IgM and IgG were positive on postpartum day 4 (day 9 after symptom onset).\n We report a severe presentation of COVID-19 during pregnancy.\n To our knowledge, this is the earliest reported positive PCR in the neonate, raising the concern for vertical transmission.\n We suggest pregnant women should be considered as a high-risk group and minimize exposures for these reasons.\n","id":"PMC7356080","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Thieme Medical Publishers","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria
