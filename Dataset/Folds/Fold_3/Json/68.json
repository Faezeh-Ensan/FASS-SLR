Multiple independent viral introductions were observed.\n Integration of multiple epidemiological strategies was able to adequately describe COVID-19 dispersion in the city.\n Presented results have helped local government authorities to guide pandemic management.\n","id":"PMC8859412","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Ana Valesca Fernandes Gilson","surname":"Silva","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Diego","surname":"Menezes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Filipe Romero Rebello","surname":"Moreira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Octávio Alcântara","surname":"Torres","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Paula Luize Camargos","surname":"Fonseca","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Rennan Garcias","surname":"Moreira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Hugo José","surname":"Alves","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Vivian Ribeiro","surname":"Alves","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Tânia Maria de Resende","surname":"Amaral","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Adriano Neves","surname":"Coelho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Júlia Maria","surname":"Saraiva Duarte","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Augusto Viana","surname":"da Rocha","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Luiz Gonzaga Paula","surname":"de Almeida","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" João Locke Ferreira","surname":"de Araújo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Hilton Soares","surname":"de Oliveira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Nova Jersey Cláudio","surname":"de Oliveira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Camila","surname":"Zolini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jôsy Hubner","surname":"de Sousa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Elizângela Gonçalves","surname":"de Souza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Rafael Marques","surname":"de Souza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Luciana de Lima","surname":"Ferreira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Alexandra","surname":"Lehmkuhl Gerber","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Ana Paula de Campos","surname":"Guimarães","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Paulo Henrique Silva","surname":"Maia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Fernanda Martins","surname":"Marim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Lucyene","surname":"Miguita","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Cristiane Campos","surname":"Monteiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Tuffi Saliba","surname":"Neto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Fabrícia Soares Freire","surname":"Pugêdo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Daniel Costa","surname":"Queiroz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Damares Nigia Alborguetti Cuzzuol","surname":"Queiroz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Luciana Cunha","surname":"Resende-Moreira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Franciele Martins","surname":"Santos","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Erika Fernanda Carlos","surname":"Souza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Carolina Moreira","surname":"Voloch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Ana Tereza","surname":"Vasconcelos","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Renato Santana","surname":"de Aguiar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Renan Pedra","surname":"de Souza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]}
