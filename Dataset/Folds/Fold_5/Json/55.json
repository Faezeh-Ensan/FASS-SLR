Patients were less likely to report shortness of breath and require hospitalization.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn an unselected large cohort of nonadvanced PD patients, COVID?19 risk and mortality did not differ from the general population, but symptoms appeared to be milder.\n\n The possible protective role of vitamin D supplementation warrants future studies.\n\n © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society\n","id":"PMC7300944","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Alfonso","surname":"Fasano","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Emanuele","surname":"Cereda","email":"e.cereda@smatteo.pv.it","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Emanuele","surname":"Cereda","email":"e.cereda@smatteo.pv.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Michela","surname":"Barichella","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Michela","surname":"Barichella","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Erica","surname":"Cassani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Valentina","surname":"Ferri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Anna Lena","surname":"Zecchinelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Gianni","surname":"Pezzoli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/nu12051359","date":"2020-05-07","title":"25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations Are Lower in Patients with Positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with a clinical outcome ranging from mild to severe, including death.\n To date, it is unclear why some patients develop severe symptoms.\n Many authors have suggested the involvement of vitamin D in reducing the risk of infections; thus, we retrospectively investigated the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in plasma obtained from a cohort of patients from Switzerland.\n In this cohort, significantly lower 25(OH)D levels (p = 0.004) were found in PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median value 11.1 ng/mL) patients compared with negative patients (24.6 ng/mL); this was also confirmed by stratifying patients according to age &gt;70 years.\n On the basis of this preliminary observation, vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce the risk of infection.\n Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations and to confirm our preliminary observation.\n","id":"PMC7285131","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"D’Avolio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Valeria","surname":"Avataneo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Valeria","surname":"Avataneo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Alessandra","surname":"Manca","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jessica","surname":"Cusato","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Amedeo","surname":"De Nicolò","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Amedeo","surname":"De Nicolò","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Renzo","surname":"Lucchini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Franco","surname":"Keller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Marco","surname":"Cantù","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s40520-020-01570-8","date":"2020-04-15","title":"The role of vitamin D in the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and mortality","abstract":"id='Par1'>WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a global pandemic.\n The present aim was to propose an hypothesis that there is a potential association between mean levels of vitamin D in various countries with cases and mortality caused by COVID-19.
