p &lt; 0.01) during peak-versus pre-epidemic stages, but revealed no differences in patient age and gender.\n\n The numbers of patients with ambulance transport, inter-hospital referral, and critical illnesses, including DOA, categorized as triage 1, or admitted to a ward or intensive care unit after the ED visit, were not influenced by the SARS epidemic.\n\n The number of patients with upper airway infections and suicide attempts from drug overdoses increased, but not statistically significantly.\n\n The number of patients with other diagnoses decreased progressively from early- to peak-epidemic stages, but returned to their earlier levels at the post-epidemic stage.\n\n Statistically significant decreases (p &lt; 0.05) were noted in mean attendance at peak-versus pre- and early-epidemic stages for patients with cardiovascular disease, inflammatory or functional bowel disease, endocrine disease, dizziness or vertigo, or trauma.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe SARS outbreak did not eliminate the need of critically ill patients for advanced medical support.\n\n However, besides an overall decrease in patient numbers, the SARS epidemic markedly altered demographic information, clinical characteristics, and the use of medical services by adult patients in the ED of a SARS-dedicated hospital.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7128348","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Elsevier.
