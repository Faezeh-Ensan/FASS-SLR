This study aimed at evaluating at evaluating the efficacy of methylprednisolone (MP) among hospitalized patients with suspected COVID-19.\nMethods\nParallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial was performed with hospitalized patients aged ? 18 years with clinical, epidemiological and/or radiological suspected COVID-19, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazil.\n\n Patients were randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to receive either intravenous MP (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline solution), twice daily, for 5 days.\n\n A modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis was conducted.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n ClinicalTrials Identifier NCT04343729.\nFindings\nFrom April 18 to June 16, 2020, 647 patients were screened, 416 randomized, and 393 analyzed as mITT, MP in 194 and placebo in 199 individuals.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR in 81.3%.\n\n Mortality at day 28 was not different between groups.\n\n A subgroup analysis showed that patients over 60 years in the MP group had a lower mortality rate at day 28. Patients in the MP arm tended to need more insulin therapy, and no difference was seen in virus clearance in respiratory secretion until day 7.\nConclusion\nThe findings of this study suggest that a short course of MP in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 did not reduce mortality in the overall population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7454320","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Christiane Maria Prado","surname":"Jeronimo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Maria Eduarda Leão","surname":"Farias","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Fernando Fonseca Almeida","surname":"Val","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Vanderson Souza","surname":"Sampaio","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Marcia Almeida Araújo","surname":"Alexandre","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Gisely Cardoso","surname":"Melo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Izabella Picinin","surname":"Safe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Mayla Gabriela Silva","surname":"Borba","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Rebeca Linhares","surname":"Abreu-Netto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Alex Bezerra Silva","surname":"Maciel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" João Ricardo Silva","surname":"Neto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Lucas Barbosa","surname":"Oliveira","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Erick Frota Gomes","surname":"Figueiredo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Kelry Mazurega Oliveira","surname":"Dinelly","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Maria Gabriela de Almeida","surname":"Rodrigues","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Marcelo","surname":"Brito","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Maria Paula Gomes","surname":"Mourão","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Guilherme Augusto","surname":"Pivoto João","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ludhmila Abrahão","surname":"Hajjar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Quique","surname":"Bassat","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Gustavo Adolfo Sierra","surname":"Romero","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Felipe Gomes","surname":"Naveca","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Heline Lira","surname":"Vasconcelos","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Michel de Araújo","surname":"Tavares","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" José Diego","surname":"Brito-Sousa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Fabio Trindade Maranhão","surname":"Costa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Maurício Lacerda","surname":"Nogueira","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Djane","surname":"Baía-da-Silva","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Mariana Simão","surname":"Xavier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Wuelton Marcelo","surname":"Monteiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Marcus Vinícius Guimarães","surname":"Lacerda","email":"marcuslacerda.br@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2021436","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Dexamethasone in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19 — Preliminary Report","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage.\n\n Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care.\n\n Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P&lt;0.001).\n\n The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization.\n\n In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs.\n\n 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs.\n\n 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs.\n\n 14.0%;
