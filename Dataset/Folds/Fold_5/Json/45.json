Health facilities in the regions most affected by Zika lacked the capacity to respond to the increased demand for contraception.\n\n The objectives were to explore healthcare users’ perceptions regarding contraception, Zika prevention during pregnancy and post-abortion care (PAC) services in the context of a Zika outbreak in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and to follow these services over time.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>This study was part of a broader implementation research study.\n\n We used qualitative research consistent with grounded theory approach.\n\n Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were performed with women and their partners who used contraceptive services or received PAC services.\n\n Data were collected in two stages from December 2017 to July 2018.
