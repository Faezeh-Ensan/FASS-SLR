From the simulated infections, we estimated hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected, age-adjusted for the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site age distribution.\n\n Our findings suggest that a large-scale outbreak is likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp, with 61%–92% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 people infected across scenarios.\n\n On average, in the first 30 days of the outbreak, we expect 18 (95% prediction interval [PI], 2–65), 54 (95% PI, 3–223), and 370 (95% PI, 4–1,850) people infected in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively.\n\n These reach 421,500 (95% PI, 376,300–463,500), 546,800 (95% PI, 499,300–567,000), and 589,800 (95% PI, 578,800–595,600) people infected in 12 months, respectively.\n\n Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 55–136 days, between the low and high transmission scenarios.\n\n We estimate 2,040 (95% PI, 1,660–2,500), 2,650 (95% PI, 2,030–3,380), and 2,880 (95% PI, 2,090–3,830) deaths in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively.\n\n Due to limited data at the time of analyses, we assumed that age was the primary determinant of infection severity and hospitalization.\n\n We expect that comorbidities, limited hospitalization, and intensive care capacity may increase this risk; thus, we may be underestimating the potential burden.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that a COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure that may exceed what is currently feasible in these settings.\n\n Detailed and realistic planning for the worst case in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now.\n\n Plans should consider novel and radical strategies to reduce infectious contacts and fill health worker gaps while recognizing that refugees may not have access to national health systems.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7297408","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Shaun","surname":"Truelove","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Orit","surname":"Abrahim","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Orit","surname":"Abrahim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Chiara","surname":"Altare","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Chiara","surname":"Altare","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Stephen A.","surname":"Lauer","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Stephen A.","surname":"Lauer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Krya H.","surname":"Grantz","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Krya H.","surname":"Grantz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Andrew S.","surname":"Azman","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Andrew S.","surname":"Azman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Paul","surname":"Spiegel","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Paul","surname":"Spiegel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Parveen","surname":"Parmar","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":" Parveen","surname":"Parmar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Parveen","surname":"Parmar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.05.07.20085365","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Unknown Title","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.05.08.20095604","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Unknown Title","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jmh.2021.100056","date":"2021-06-13","title":"SARS-CoV-2 among migrants and forcibly displaced populations: A rapid systematic review","abstract":"The economic and health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic pose a particular threat to vulnerable groups, such as migrants, particularly forcibly displaced populations.\n The aim of this review is (i) to synthesize the evidence on risk of infection and transmission among migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced populations, and (ii) the effect of lockdown measures on these populations.\n We searched MEDLINE and WOS, preprint servers, and pertinent websites between 1st December 2019 and 26th June 2020.
