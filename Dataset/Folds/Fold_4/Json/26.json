plasma for the treatment of severe influenza: an open-label, multicentre, phase 2 randomised study","abstract":"Background\nInfluenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality despite available treatments.\n\n Anecdotal reports suggest that plasma with high antibody titres to influenza might be of benefit in the treatment of severe influenza.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial, 29 academic medical centres in the USA assessed the safety and efficacy of anti-influenza plasma with haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres of 1:80 or more to the infecting strain.\n\n Hospitalised children and adults (including pregnant women) with severe influenza A or B (defined as the presence of hypoxia or tachypnoea) were randomly assigned to receive either two units (or paediatric equivalent) of anti-influenza plasma plus standard care, versus standard care alone, and were followed up for 28 days.\n\n The primary endpoint was time to normalisation of patients' respiratory status (respiratory rate of ?20 breaths per min for adults or age-defined thresholds of 20–38 breaths per min for children) and a room air oxygen saturation of 93% or more.\n\n This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, number NCT01052480.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Jan 13, 2011, and March 2, 2015, 113 participants were screened for eligibility and 98 were randomly assigned from 20 out of 29 participating sites.\n\n Of the participants with confirmed influenza (by PCR), 28 (67%) of 42 in the plasma plus standard care group normalised their respiratory status by day 28 compared with 24 (53%) of 45 participants on standard care alone (p=0·069).\n\n The hazard ratio (HR) comparing plasma plus standard care with standard care alone was 1·71 (95% CI 0·96–3·06).\n\n Six participants died, one (2%) from the plasma plus standard care group and five (10%) from the standard care group (HR 0·19 [95% CI 0·02–1·65], p=0·093).\n\n Participants in the plasma plus standard care group had non-significant reductions in days in hospital (median 6 days [IQR 4–16] vs 11 days [5–25], p=0·13) and days on mechanical ventilation (median 0 days [IQR 0–6] vs 3 days [0–14], p=0·14).\n\n Fewer plasma plus standard care participants had serious adverse events compared with standard care alone recipients (nine [20%] of 46 vs 20 [38%] of 52, p=0·041), the most frequent of which were acute respiratory distress syndrome (one [2%] vs two [4%] patients) and stroke (one [2%] vs two [4%] patients).\n\n\nInterpretation\nAlthough there was no significant effect of plasma treatment on the primary endpoint, the treatment seemed safe and well tolerated.\n\n A phase 3 randomised trial is now underway to further assess this intervention.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, US National Institutes of Health.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5828518","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection in China","abstract":"Background\nWhile human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection continue to increase globally, available clinical data on H5N1 cases are limited.\n\n We conducted a retrospective study of 26 confirmed human H5N1 cases identified through surveillance in China from October 2005 through April 2008.\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nData were collected from hospital medical records of H5N1 cases and analyzed.\n\n The median age was 29 years (range 6–62) and 58% were female.\n\n Many H5N1 cases reported fever (92%) and cough (58%) at illness onset, and had lower respiratory findings of tachypnea and dyspnea at admission.\n\n All cases progressed rapidly to bilateral pneumonia.\n\n Clinical complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 81%), cardiac failure (50%), elevated aminotransaminases (43%), and renal dysfunction (17%).\n\n Fatal cases had a lower median nadir platelet count (64.5×109 cells/L vs 93.0×109 cells/L, p?=?0.02), higher median peak lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level (1982.5 U/L vs 1230.0 U/L, p?=?0.001), higher percentage of ARDS (94% [n?=?16] vs 56% [n?=?5], p?=?0.034) and more frequent cardiac failure (71% [n?=?12] vs 11% [n?=?1], p?=?0.011) than nonfatal cases.\n\n A higher proportion of patients who received antiviral drugs survived compared to untreated (67% [8/12] vs 7% [1/14], p?=?0.003).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThe clinical course of Chinese H5N1 cases is characterized by fever and cough initially, with rapid progression to lower respiratory disease.\n\n Decreased platelet count, elevated LDH level, ARDS and cardiac failure were associated with fatal outcomes.\n\n Clinical management of H5N1 cases should be standardized in China to include early antiviral treatment for suspected H5N1 cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2515635","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Public Library of

convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue severe patients.\n The results from 10 severe adult cases showed that one dose (200 mL) of CP was well tolerated and could significantly increase or maintain the neutralizing antibodies at a high level, leading to disappearance of viremia in 7 d.\n Meanwhile, clinical symptoms and paraclinical criteria rapidly improved within 3 d.\n Radiological examination showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d.\n These results indicate that CP can serve as a promising rescue option for severe COVID-19, while the randomized trial is

Disease in Freetown, Sierra Leone","abstract":"Background\nConvalescent blood therapy has been a promising form of treatment for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), but less attention has been focused on it for treatment.\n\n\nMethod\nWe assessed the effectiveness of convalescent whole blood (CWB) in the treatment of consented EVD patients.\n\n We recruited 69 subjects in December 2014 up to April 2015, at the 34 Military Hospital in Wilberforce and the PTS 1 Ebola Treatment Unit in Hastings, Freetown.\n\n Forty-four were given CWB, and 25 who consented but preferred to be exempted from the CWB treatment were used to compare clinical outcomes.\n\n All were given routine treatment used at the Ebola Treatment Unit.\n\n\nResults\nOne of 44 subjects treated with CWB dropped out of the study and 31 recovered while 12 succumbed to the disease with a case fatality rate of 27.9%.\n\n For the group that was given routine treatment without CWB, 11 died with a case fatality rate of 44%.\n\n There was a significant difference between admission viral load and viral load after the first 24 h of treatment with convalescent whole blood (P &lt; 0.01).\n\n The odds ratio for survival with CWB was 2.3 (95% CI, 0.8–6.5).\n\n\nConclusion\nCWB is promising for treating EVD in resource-poor settings, especially in the early phases of outbreaks when resource-mobilization is done.\n\n Even though our sample size was small and the evaluation was not randomised, our results contribute to existing evidence that convalescent whole blood could be considered as a useful candidate for treating EVD.\n\n Further studies that are randomised will be required to further assess the efficacy of CWB as treatment option during any EVD outbreak.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112610","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"The British Infection Association.

COVID-19 Patients","abstract":"Currently, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in almost all countries globally, and no effective therapy has been documented for COVID-19 and the role of convalescent plasma therapy is unknown.\n In current study, 6 COVID-19 subjects with respiratory failure received convalescent plasma at a median of 21.5 days after first detection of viral shedding, all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by 3 days after infusion, and 5 died eventually.\n In conclusion, convalescent plasma treatment can discontinue SARS-CoV-2 shedding but cannot reduce mortality in critically end-stage COVID-19 patients, and treatment should be initiated earlier.\n","id":"PMC7197534","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Oxford University

treatment of COVID-19 infections: Results of a multicenter clinical study","abstract":"Since Dec.\n 2019 the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions and claimed life of several hundred thousand worldwide.\n However, so far no approved vaccine or drug therapy is available for treatment of virus infection.\n Convalescent plasma has been considered a potential modality for COVID-19 infection.\n One hundred eighty-nine COVID-19 positive patients including 115 patients in plasma therapy group and 74 patients in control group, registered in the hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 infection, entered this multi-center clinical study.\n Comparison of outcomes including all-cause mortality, total hospitalization days and patients’ need for intubation between the two patient groups shows that total of 98 (98.2 %) of patients who received convalescent plasma were discharged from hospital which is substantially higher compared to 56 (78.7 %) patients in control group.\n Length of hospitalization days was significantly lower (9.54 days) in convalescent plasma group compared with that of control group (12.88 days).\n Only 8 patients (7%) in convalescent plasma group required intubation while that was 20 % in control group.\n This clinical study provides strong evidence to support the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 patients and recommends this treatment for management of these patients.\n Clinical efficacy, immediate availability and potential cost effectiveness could be considered as main advantages of convalescent plasma therapy.\n","id":"PMC7362821","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Hassan","surname":"Abolghasemi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"
