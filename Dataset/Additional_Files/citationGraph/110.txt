For example, Chen et al. described 25 pulmonary CT angiograms examinations from 1008 COVID-19 patients; 10 were positive for pulmonary embolism mostly as segmental or sub-segmental APE. In addition, D-dimer levels have been reported as elevated in patients with COVID-19 with the suggestion of an independent association between the severity of the disease and the level of D-dimer. The purpose of this report is to describe the rate of pulmonary embolus in patients classified as COVID-19 infection and who underwent chest CT at a tertiary referral centre.\nMaterials and Methods\nPatient Population\nThe local ethics committee of Strasbourg University Hospital approved this retrospective study and waived the need of informed consent. Full methods are provided in Appendix E1 (online). From March 1st to March 31st, medical records of all consecutive patients who underwent a CT examination 1) including the chest and 2) performed for either suspicion or follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 infection at one of our 2 hospital sites (Nouvel Hopital Civil and Hopital de Hautepierre, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, France) were evaluated. CT examinations that included pulmonary CT angiographic images were evaluated for further study. Clinical and demographic parameters for patients with and without pulmonary embolus in CT pulmonary angiogram were evaluated.\nCT Pulmonary Angiography\nCT angiograms were acquired on 64 row or greater scanners after injection of 50 to 75 mL of high concentration iodine contrast media, with the use of a bolus-tracking technique and a threshold of 160 HU to 250 HU in the main pulmonary artery. Images were reconstructed with a slice-thickness of 1 mm in mediastinal and parenchymal windows. A single reader (ILL) classified pulmonary embolism location as main pulmonary arteries, lobar, segmental or subsegmental based on the location of the most proximal luminal defect.\nLaboratory Analysis\nFibrinogen and D-dimer levels were recorded for all patients who had pulmonary CT angiography. All patients with pulmonary CT angiography were evaluated for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for SARS-CoV-2. All initial samples were obtained by nasopharyngeal swab; some patients had second or third sampling using sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage. Any positive result was classified as confirmed COVID-19 infection. When RT-PCR was negative, chest CT was reviewed by a senior chest radiologist (MO, with 14 years of experience) to look for characteristic COVID-19 lung parenchyma lesions. When CT images were considered typical (i.e. extensive bilateral and peripheral ground glass opacities and/or alveolar consolidation) and clinical data were compatible, the patient was also adjudicated as having COVID-19.\nRESULTS\nA flowchart of all patients with CT scans performed from March 1st to March 31st, 2020 is shown in Figure 1. During this period, 1696 patients had CT for suspicion or follow-up of COVID-19 infection. Dedicated pulmonary CT angiograms were performed in 135/1696 (8%) patients, 25 additional patients had pulmonary arterial phase images included in the chest/ abdomen/ pelvic CT scan (total, 160 patients). Of these 160 patients, 106 patients were classified as COVID-19 infection (97 patients by RT-PCR and 9 patients with positive CT and negative RT-PCR test). The reason for CT angiography in these patients was suspicion of pulmonary embolus in 67/106 (63%) patients and other CT indication in 39/106 (37%) patients.\nFlowchart of the study.\nThirty-two of 106 (30%, [95%CI 22-40%]) patients with COVID-19 and with pulmonary CT angiogram were positive for acute pulmonary embolus; 74 were negative on CT. Relevant clinical and biological data are summarized in the Table.\nClinical and biological data for patients undergoing pulmonary CT angiogram and classified as COVID-19 infection.\nPatients with COVID-19 infection and pulmonary embolus had higher D-dimer levels than those without pulmonary embolus (median, IQR 6110+-4905 versus 1920+-3674 microg/L, respectively, p&lt;.001), were more likely to be in the intensive care unit (24/32 (75%) versus 24/74 (32%), p&lt;.001) and were treated more often with low weight molecular heparin before CT angiography (25/32 (78%) versus 17/74 (23%), p&lt;.001) (Table). In these patients with COVID-19 infection, D-dimer greater than 2660 microg/L had a sensitivity of 32/32 (100%, 95%CI 88-100) and a specificity of 49/74 (67%, 95% CI 52-79) for pulmonary embolism on CT angiography. See Figure 2 for an example patient.\n71-year-old woman at day 3 of ICU stay for ARDS secondary to COVID-19. Pulmonary CT angiography was performed to investigate elevated of D-dimer value above 20 000 microg/L. The CT angiogram demonstrates bilateral filling defects in the main pulmonary arteries. Bilateral peripheral ground glass opacities and small areas of consolidation are present.\nDISCUSSION\nOur study demonstrated that of 106 pulmonary CT angiograms performed for COVID-19 patients over a one-month period in a tertiary care centre; 32/106 (30%) of patients had acute pulmonary embolus. This rate of pulmonary embolus is higher than usually encountered in critically ill patients without COVID-19 infection (1.3%,) or in emergency department patients (3 to 10%). In our patient population, a D-dimer threshold of 2660 microg/L detected all patients with pulmonary embolus on chest CT. This threshold of 2660 microg/L is higher than previously reported median level of 2400 and 900 and is higher than cut-off values used to exclude pulmonary embolus in non-ICU patients. High values of d-dimer could be related to a higher activation of blood coagulation in COVID-19 patients secondary to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome - or as a direct consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 itself. Although a single center retrospective report, our results of the potential for pulmonary embolism associated with COVID-19 infection may serve to alert the medical community to heighted vigilance of this complication.\nAPPENDIX\nReferences\nFindings of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in COVID-19 Patients\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nEpidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study\nDiagnostic utility of clinical laboratory data determinations for patients with the severe COVID-19\nRadiological findings from 81 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study\nFailure of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis: risk factors in medical-surgical critically ill patients*\nPulmonary embolism: the diagnosis, risk-stratification, treatment and disposition of emergency department patients\nPrevalence of venous thromboembolism in patients with severe novel coronavirus pneumonia\nUsing an age-dependent D-dimer cut-off value increases the number of older patients in whom deep vein thrombosis can be safely excluded\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Findings of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in COVID-19 Patients","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30154-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

A few studies and isolated clinical cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with coagulopathy and pulmonary embolus have recently been published. The main objective of our study was to evaluate pulmonary embolus in association with COVID-19 infection using pulmonary CT angiography.\nMaterials and Methods\nThis retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board. It followed the ethical guidelines of the declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was waived. Three authors (F.G., J.B., P.C.) had access to the study data. No author has any conflict of interest to declare in relation to this study.\nPatients\nThe inclusion criteria were consecutive adult patients (&gt;= 18 years old) with a RT-PCR diagnosis (NucleoSpin RNA Virus kit, Macherey-Nagel Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA) of SARS-CoV-2 or a strong clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms, exposure to an individual with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection) who underwent a chest CT scan between March 15 to April 14, 2020 at a single center. In patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, chest CT scan was performed when clinical features of severe disease were present (e.g., requirement for mechanical ventilation [IMV]) or underlying comorbidities). Patients with non-contrast chest CT scans were excluded.\nCT Protocol\nOur routine protocol for patients with severe clinical features of COVID-19 infection was multidetector pulmonary CT angiography using 256 slice multi-detector CT (Revolution, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) after intravenous injection of 60 ml iodinated contrast agent (Iomeprol 400 Mg I/mL, Bracco Imaging, Milan, IT) at a flow rate of 4 mL/s, triggered on the main pulmonary artery. CT scan settings were 120 kVp, 80 x .625 mm, rotation time .28 s, average tube current 300 mA, pitch .992 and CTDIvol 4.28 mGy.\nImaging Analysis. Chest CT scan pattern of COVID-19 and presence of pulmonary embolus were independently analyzed by two chest radiologists (J.B. and F.G. with 11 and 6 years of experience) on a PACS workstation (Carestream Health, Rochester, NY). Readers were blinded to patient status as well as clinical and biological features. In cases of discordance, a simultaneous reading to reach consensus was achieved.\nStatistical Analysis\nComparisons between continuous variables were performed using Student t-test when distribution was normal. Comparison between categorical variables were performed using Pearson's chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. To determine the clinical factors associated with pulmonary embolus, we considered the CT extent of lesions, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, demographics, and the presence of comorbidities as potential independent variables in a logistic regression model. A P value of less than .05 indicated a significant difference. All analyses were performed with R version 3.4.4 (R Core Team 2017).\nResults\nOf 2003 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 280 patients were hospitalized during the study period. Of these, 129 of 280 (46%) hospitalized patients underwent CT scan at an average of 9 +- 5 days after symptom onset. Twenty-nine patients had non-contrast chest CT due to contraindication to iodinated contrast or non-severe clinical features and thus were excluded. Finally, 100 patients with COVID-19 infection and severe clinical features were included were examined with contrast enhanced CT (Figure 1). The mean age of the included patients was 66 +- 13 years old, with 70 men and 30 women (Table; Appendix E1 [online]). Of 100 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 23 (23%, [95%CI, 15-33%]) patients had acute pulmonary embolism (Figure 2; Appendix E1 [online]). Patients with pulmonary embolus were more frequently in the critical care unit than those without pulmonary embolus (17 (74%) vs 22 (29%) patients, p&lt;.001), required mechanical ventilation more often (15 (65%) versus 19 (25%) patients, p&lt;.001) and had longer delay from symptom onset to CT diagnosis of pulmonary embolus (12 +- 6 versus 8 +- 5 days, p&lt;.001), respectively (Table). In multivariable analysis, requirement for mechanical ventilation (OR = 3.8 IC95% [1.02 - 15], p=.049) remained associated with acute pulmonary embolus.\nFlow chart of the study.\nPulmonary CT angiography of a 68 year old male. The CT scan was obtained 10 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and on the day the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Axial CT images (lung windows) (a,b) show peripheral ground-glass opacities (arrow) associated with areas of consolidation in dependent portions of the lung (arrowheads). Interlobular reticulations, bronchiectasis (black arrow) and lung architectural distortion are present. Involvement of the lung volume was estimated to be between 25% and 50%. Coronal CT reformations (mediastinum windows) (c,d) show bilateral lobar and segmental pulmonary embolism (black arrows).\nPatient Characteristics\nDiscussion\nOur study points to a high prevalence of acute pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19 (23%, [95%CI, 15-33%]). Pulmonary embolus was diagnosed at mean of 12 days from symptom onset. Patients with pulmonary embolus were more likely require care in the critical care unit and to require mechanical ventilation than those without pulmonary embolus (Table).\nCurrent guidelines recommend performing non-contrast chest CT to assess the COVID-19 CT pattern and its extension. However, prior reports suggested coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 infection [e.g. ]. Further, these patients have frequent risk factors for pulmonary embolus (e.g. mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission). Therefore, we routinely performed contrast enhanced CT for COVID-19 patients with severe clinical features to evaluate the lung parenchyma as well as to evaluate other complications that may result in respiratory distress.\nOur results showed frequent (23%) pulmonary embolus in patients with COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, pulmonary embolus was associated with invasive mechanical ventilation and male gender. Interestingly, extent of lesions was not a associated with pulmonary embolus. We acknowledge the preliminary nature of these findings, including its retrospective nature and limited sample size. Important clinical markers were not available that may explain or be associated with pulmonary embolus, including D-dimer (only 22 of 100 patients had D-dimer levels available). Nevertheless, our results suggest that patients with severe clinical features of COVID-19 may have associated acute pulmonary embolus. Therefore, the use of contrast enhanced CT rather than routine non-contrast CT may be considered for these patients.\nAPPENDIX\nAbbreviations:\nPulmonary embolus\nAcute Pulmonary Embolism\nCOVID-19\nCoronavirus Disease 2019\nCTA\nComputed Tomography Angiography\nIMV\nInvasive Mechanical Ventilation\nRT-PCR\nreal-time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction\nSARS-CoV-2\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\nReferences\nAcute pulmonary embolism and COVID-19 pneumonia: a random association\nCOVID-19 Complicated by Acute Pulmonary Embolism\nReview: Viral infections and mechanisms of thrombosis and bleeding\nRadiological Society of North America Expert Consensus Statement on Reporting Chest CT Findings Related to COVID-19.

The presence of APE was not limited to severe or critical clinical type of COVID-19 pneumonia.\nKey Points\n   Acute pulmonary embolism was found in 18% of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients referred by the emergency department to CTPA. Two (15%) patients had main, four (30%) lobar, and seven (55%) segmental acute pulmonary embolism. \n   Five of 13 (38%) patients with acute pulmonary embolism had a moderate clinical type. \n   Severity and radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia showed no significant difference between patients with or without acute pulmonary embolism. \nIntroduction\nNon-contrast chest CT has been shown to play an important role in the evaluation of COVID-19 pneumonia. Because of its excellent sensitivity in comparison with the RT-PCR test and its high specificity in an epidemic context, chest CT can be used as a complementary means of diagnosing COVID-19 alongside RT-PCR. Non-contrast chest CT also allows assessing the severity of the pulmonary involvement and could play a key role in therapeutic efficacy evaluation in combination with clinical information.\nThe place of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in the evaluation of COVID-19 pneumonia remains more limited. It is reserved for patients whose clinical condition has deteriorated in order to search for an acute pulmonary embolism (APE). Recent immunohistologic and biological studies have reported that COVID-19 can cause microvascular injuries and is associated with a procoagulant state. Several published studies seem to confirm the association between COVID-19 and APE in hospitalized patients with severe to critical form. In our practice, we have found cases of APE in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients referred to the CTPA by our emergency department.\nThe objective of our study was to retrospectively assess the prevalence of APE in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients referred to the CTPA by the emergency department.\nMaterials and methods\nCase selection\nAll requests for chest CT scans for suspicion or assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia in non-hospitalized patients presenting in the emergency department of our hospital between March 14, 2020, and April 6, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who underwent CTPA were included in our study. To have a final diagnosis of COVID-19, patients had to either have at least a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, or a combination of compatible clinical findings (fever, cough, dyspnea, asthenia, myalgia, or diarrhea) and a chest CT with typical COVID-19 pneumonia features (bilateral ground-glass opacities with peripheral distribution and vascular thickening). The indications for CTPA varied among emergency physicians and radiologists. They were mainly based on a worsening of the patient's clinical condition with new onset of dyspnea, desaturation, or chest pain and also an increase in D-dimer levels. Patients were divided into two groups: an APE group for patients with an acute pulmonary embolism discovered by CTPA and a non-APE group for patients without acute pulmonary embolism.\nThis study was approved by the ethics committee of our institution and the requirement for informed consent was waived.\nClinical and biological data\nThe following clinical and laboratory data were extracted from our medical records: patient history, age, sex, body mass index (BMI), symptoms (fever (&gt; 37.5  C), cough, dyspnea, desaturation, chest pain, asthenia, myalgia, and diarrhea), delay between onset of symptoms and CT scan, D-dimer and CRP (C-reactive protein) when available.\nClinical classification\nAll cases were divided into four groups: minimal, moderate, severe, and critical according to whether there were clinical symptoms, severity of pneumonia, respiratory failure, shock, other organ failure, based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of COVID-19 issued by National Health Commission (7th ed.) (in Chinese). (1) Mild type: mild clinical symptoms without pneumonia in imaging; (2) moderate type: fever, respiratory tract and other symptoms with pneumonia in imaging; (3) severe type: respiratory distress, respiratory rate &gt;= 30 times/min; in resting state, oxygen saturation &lt;= 93%; PaO2/FiO2 &lt;= 300 mmHg; (4) critical type: respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, and other organ failure requiring ICU monitoring and treatment.\nCT acquisition\nCT scans were acquired in the supine position on a 64-MDCT (Revolution EVO, GE Healthcare). The CT scanning range covered the area from the apices to the bases of the lungs. The examination began by performing an unenhanced low-dose cranio-caudal series with deep-inspiration breath-holding. The acquisition parameters were as follows: 120 kVp, tube current modulation with a noise index setting of 50 (80-300 mA); ASIR-V, 40%; pitch, 1.531; rotation time, 0.35 s. The examination was completed with a caudal-cranial breath-hold CTPA without deep inspiration in order to avoid a transient interruption of contrast, with intravenous administration of 50 ml of iodinated contrast medium at 4 to 5 ml/s followed by a flush of 20 ml of physiological saline solution using a bolus-tracking technique. The CTPA acquisition parameters were as follows: 100 kVp; tube current modulation with a noise index setting of 30 (140-480 mA); ASIR-V, 50%; pitch, 1.531; rotation time, 0.35 s. The images were reconstructed with slice thickness of 1.25 mm and LUNG filter for the unenhanced low-dose series and 0.625 mm and SOFT filter for the CTPA. All images were archived and sent to our institution's Picture and Archiving Communication System.\nImage analysis\nAll patient images were anonymized and CT scans were randomized for interpretation on SyngoVia post-processing workstations (VB30, Siemens Healthcare). The images were reviewed by two radiologists with 10 and 12 years of experience in thoracic imaging (C.B. and E.P.). The images were reviewed independently with a final decision made by consensus. During image interpretation, the radiologists were able to change the viewing window, to zoom in or out on the images, use multiplanar reformations in any plane, and use maximal intensity projection or minimal intensity projection reformations. They were not made aware of the patient's clinical data.\nFor the CTPA images, the evaluation criteria were as follows: quality of the CTPA based on the degree of opacification of the pulmonary arteries and the presence or absence of significant respiratory movement artifacts (1 = excellent quality; 2 = satisfactory quality allowing a correct interpretation of all the pulmonary arteries; 3 = unsatisfactory quality not allowing a correct interpretation of all the pulmonary arteries), presence or not of acute pulmonary embolism (defined by the presence of a defect filling the lumen of a pulmonary artery on at least two consecutive axial sections), location of pulmonary embolism (main, lobar, segmental, or subsegmental pulmonary arteries), topography of pulmonary emboli in the five pulmonary lobes, presence or absence of CT signs of severity (right ventricle/left ventricle ratio of &gt;= 1).\nFor the lung images, the evaluation criteria were the following: presence or absence of ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving, linear opacities (including subpleural curvilinear opacities), and pleural effusion. According to the proportion of each pattern in comparison with the totality of the lung opacification, cases were classified as GGO dominant or consolidation predominant, if the proportion of each one of the patterns was respectively greater than 50% of the total. A quantitative score was used to estimate the pulmonary involvement of all these abnormalities on the basis of the percentage of the total lung involved per lobe. For each of the five lung lobes, the lobar involvement was classified as none (0%), minimal (1-25%), mild (26-50%), moderate (51-75%), or severe (76-100%), with corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The total severity score (TSS) was reached by summing the five lobe scores (range from 0 to 20).\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables were presented as means with standard deviation and extreme values in parentheses and compared by Mann-Whitney U test between APE and non-APE groups. Categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages and were compared by Fisher's exact test between both groups. Two-sided p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was done using R for Windows software (version 3.6.3, R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\nResults\nPatient selection\nGraph showing the patient selection process for inclusion in our study\nThe results of the patient selection process in our study are shown in Fig. 1. From March, 14, 2020, to April 6, 2020, 211 patients were referred by the emergency department to undergo a chest CT for suspicion or assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia. A total of 146 (69%) patients had a final diagnosis of COVID-19 and 72 (49%) patients underwent CTPA and were included in our study. Thirteen (18%) patients had APE (APE group) versus 59 (82%) without APE (non-APE group). Of the 72 patients included in the study, 58 (80%) patients had a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 10 (14%) did not have RT-PCR (including three from the APE group), and 4 (6%) had a diagnosis based on the typical clinical and radiological presentation of COVID-19 with RT-PCR results negative for SARS-CoV-2 (two patients with a single sample including one patient from the APE group, and two patients with two negative RT-PCR including one from the APE group).\nDemographic, clinical, and biological characteristics\nDemographic, clinical, and biological characteristics of patients included in the study\n	All patients (n = 72)	APE group (n = 13)	Non-APE group (n = 59)	p value	 	Age (years)	62.3 +- 17.8 (22-92)	74.4 +- 15.0 (48-92)	59.6 +- 17.4 (22-92)	0.008	 	BMI (kg/m2)	26.7 +- 5.4 (16.1-51.2)	24.0 +- 3.5 (18.7-32)	27.3 +- 5.6 (16.1-51.2)	0.021	 	Gender (n)	 	  Male	54 (75%)	10 (77%)	44 (75%)	1	 	  Female	18 (25%)	3 (23%)	15 (25%)	 	  Time to CTPA (days)	7.6 +- 4.2 (0-20)	8.3 +- 5.7 (0-19)	7.5 +- 3.9 (0-20)	0.617	 	Symptoms (n)	 	  Fever	51 (71%)	9 (69%)	42 (71%)	1	 	  Cough	41 (57%)	6 (46%)	35 (59%)	0.537	 	  Dyspnea	49 (68%)	10 (77%)	39 (66%)	0.529	 	  Desaturation	48 (67%)	9 (69%)	39 (66%)	1	 	  Chest pain	10 (14%)	2 (15%)	8 (14%)	1	 	  Asthenia	29 (40%)	4 (31%)	25 (42%)	0.541	 	  Myalgia	19 (26%)	3 (23%)	16 (27%)	1	 	  Diarrhea	11 (15%)	1 (8%)	10 (17%)	0.381	 	Clinical type (n)	 	  Moderate	31 (43%)	5 (38%)	26 (44%)	0.766	 	  Severe-critical	41 (57%)	8 (62%)	33 (56%)	 	Biology	 	  D-Dimer (mug/ml)a	3.61 +- 4.54 (0.33-20.00)	7.29 +- 6.34 (2.41-20.00)	3.29 +- 4.62 (0.33-20.00)	0.011	 	  CRP (mg/l)b	111.9 +- 84.2 (2.1-345)	136.8 +- 105.8 (35.0-345.0)	105.0 +- 76 (2.1-331.0)	0.407	 	Outcome (n)	 	  Discharge	38 (53%)	4 (31%)	34 (58%)	0.124	 	  Hospitalization	23 (32%)	6 (46%)	17 (29%)	0.324	 	  Death	11 (15%)	3 (23%)	8 (13%)	0.405	 	\nExcept for p value, continuous variables are presented as mean +- standard deviation and extreme values in parentheses and compared by means of the Mann-Whitney U test between the APE group and non-APE group.

The group consisted of 54 men and 18 women with an average age of 62.3 years and an average BMI of 26.7 kg/m2. Patients in the APE group were significantly older than those in the non-APE group (74.4 vs. 59.6 years, p = 0.008) with a significantly lower BMI (24.0 vs. 27.3 kg/m2, p = 0.021). There was no significant difference between the APE group and the non-APE group in terms of male/female distribution and the time between the onset of symptoms and the time at which CTPA was performed (8.3 vs. 7.5 days, p = 0.617). The most frequently found symptoms were fever (71%), dyspnea (68%), and desaturation (67%), with no significant difference between the two groups. Six patients (three in each group) were followed for active neoplasia. The clinical classification type was identified as moderate for 31 (43%) patients and severe to critical for 41 (57%) patients, with no significant difference between both groups. Biologically, 7 (54%) patients in the APE group and 34 (57%) in the non-APE group had a D-dimer test on the same day as the CT scan. A significantly higher D-dimer level was found in the APE group compared with the non-APE group (7.29 vs. 3.29 mug/ml, p = 0.011). Only one patient in the non-APE group had a normal D-dimer level (0.33 mug/ml), and none of those in the APE group. All the patients in the APE group had had a CRP test on the same day as the CT scan as well as 56 (95%) patients in the non-APE group, with no significant difference in CRP levels between the two groups (136 mg/l vs. 105 mg/l, p = 0.407). As of April 15, 2020, 38 (53%) patients had returned home, 23 (32%) were hospitalized, and 11 (15%) had died, with no significant difference in the outcome rate among patients in the APE group compared with the non-APE group.\nImaging findings\nChest CT findings for all patients and for APE vs. non-APE groups\n	All patients (n = 72)	APE group (n = 13)	Non-APE group (n = 59)	p value	 	CTPA quality score	2.0 +- 0.9 (1-3)	1.8 +- 1.0 (1-3)	2.0 +- 0.8 (1-3)	0.518	 	Chest CT severity score	7.0 +- 3.5 (0-15)	6.3 +- 3.7 (1-15)	7.1 +- 3.4 (0-15)	0.365	 	Lobe involvement (n)	 	  Left upper lobe	59 (82%)	8 (62%)	51 (86%)	0.05	 	  Left lower lobe	64 (89%)	12 (92%)	52 (88%)	1	 	  Right upper lobe	64 (89%)	10 (77%)	54 (92%)	0.151	 	  Right middle lobe	58 (81%)	8 (62%)	50 (85%)	0.114	 	  Right lower lobe	68 (94%)	13 (100%)	55 (93%)	1	 	  More than two lobes	65 (90%)	12 (92%)	53 (90%)	1	 	Radiological findings (n)	 	  GGO	68 (94%)	11 (85%)	57 (97%)	0.147	 	  Consolidation	49 (68%)	9 (69%)	40 (68%)	1	 	  Crazy paving	27 (38%)	5 (38%)	22 (37%)	1	 	  Linear reticulation	55 (76%)	9 (69%)	46 (78%)	0.490	 	Radiological pattern (n)	 	  GGO &gt; consolidation	40	7 (54%)	33 (56%)	1	 	  Consolidation &gt; GGO	31	6 (46%)	25 (42%)	1	 	  Normal CT scan	1	0 (0%)	1 (2%)		 	  Pleural effusion (n)	16 (22%)	5 (38%)	11 (19%)	0.146	 	\nExcept for p value, continuous variables are presented as mean +- standard deviation and extreme values in parentheses and compared by means of the Mann-Whitney U test between the APE group and non-APE group.

Two (15%) patients had main, four (30%) lobar, and seven (55%) segmental APE. The segments most often affected were the right lower lobe (61%) and the left lower lobe (54%). Five (38%) patients had bilateral thrombi while eight (62%) had unilateral involvement only. Five (38%) CTPA showed the presence of a CT sign of severity with a RV &gt; LV ratio greater than or equal to 1. The quality score for the interpretation of the CTPA was comparable between the APE and non-APE groups (1.8 vs. 2.0, p = 0.518) with a similar proportion of insufficient quality (38% vs. 35%, p = 1).\nChest CT showed anomalies related to COVID-19 pneumonia in 71 (98.6%) of the 72 patients. One (1.4%) patient in the non-APE group had a normal chest CT scan. No significant difference between the two groups was found in the number of patients with more than two lobes involved (92% vs. 90%, p = 1). There was significantly less involvement of the left upper lobe in the APE group compared with the non-APE group (62% vs. 86%, p = 0.05). The frequency of involvement of the other lobes did not show any significant difference between the two groups. Both the APE and non-APE groups showed similar proportions of GGO (85% vs. 97%, p = 0.147), of consolidation (69% vs. 68%, p = 1), of crazy paving (38% vs. 37%, p = 1), of linear reticulation (69% vs. 78%, p = 0.490), and of pleural effusion (38% vs. 19%, p = 0.146). The type of pulmonary involvement with a predominance of GGO or consolidation was equivalent between the APE and non-APE groups (54% vs. 56%, p = 1; and 46% vs. 42%, p = 1). The TSS did not show a significant difference between the APE and non-APE groups (6.3 vs. 7.1, p = 0.365). Fifty-eight (81%) patients had a TSS lower than 10 with no significant difference between the two groups (85% vs. 80%, p = 1).\nDiscussion\nSegmental acute pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients: one was a 61-year-old man presenting to the emergency department for fever and myalgia during 9 days with new onset of dyspnea without desaturation. The RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Unenhanced chest CT scan (a) revealed typical COVID-19 pneumonia with mild lung involvement (TSS of 7). CTPA in axial (b) and coronal reformation (c) showed a segmental acute pulmonary embolism of the right lower lobe (arrows). After 2 days of hospitalization, the patient was discharged at home with a good outcome\nCOVID-19 presents many clinical forms, from cases of pauci- or asymptomatic patients to cases of severe forms of COVID-19 pneumonia which may lead to the patient's death. The association between COVID-19 pneumonia and APE has already been described in patients hospitalized with severe to critical clinical type. To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet evaluated the prevalence of APE in outpatients consulting to the emergency department for clinical suspicion or degradation of COVID-19 pneumonia. One case describes the discovery of APE in a COVID-19 patient with a mild clinical form presenting to the emergency department for hemoptysis. In our study, we focused on patients presenting to the emergency department for suspected or worsening COVID-19 pneumonia. Among these patients, many presented not only a deterioration of their clinical state with dyspnea (68%), desaturation (67%), or chest pain (14%) but also an increase in D-dimer levels. These anomalies, although not specific, led us to complement our non-contrast chest CT scans with CTPA to eliminate APE. Of our 146 CT scans performed on COVID-19 patients, we complemented the examinations with 72 (49%) CTPA. Thirteen APE were discovered, representing a prevalence of 18% of the patients included in our study. Eight patients with APE had a severe to critical COVID-19 pneumonia but 5 of the 13 (38%) patients with APE had a moderate clinical form (Fig. 2). These results seem to confirm the association between COVID-19 and APE, even in non-severe and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\nSeveral factors could explain this association. Radiologically, vascular thickening in ground-glass areas has been described in chest CT, which could correspond to a serious inflammatory response with vascular involvement leading to thrombosis. Biologically, several studies have shown that COVID-19 patients tend to have higher D-dimer, fibrinogen, and fibrin degradation product levels. Zhou et al also found in their study that a D-dimer level greater than 1 mug/ml was associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19. Other factors such as bed rest or confinement could also explain the onset of thromboembolic complications. In our study, three patients with APE had active cancer. Wider use of CTPA for COVID-19 patients seems to be advisable, with particular attention on COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities causing a higher thromboembolic risk.\nComparison of lung findings in a COVID-19 patient between unenhanced low-dose chest CT with deep inspiration (a) and CTPA acquisition with breath-hold without deep inspiration (b). The unenhanced series with deep inspiration allows correct analysis of the parenchyma in COVID-19 patients in comparison with CTPA series showing ventilation disturbances which may resemble false GGO images\nGiven the risks associated with the injection of iodinated contrast medium (renal failure and allergy) and the additional radiation dose due to CTPA, it does not seem reasonable to perform CTPA systematically with COVID-19 patients. In our study, we investigated whether the radiological manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia in non-contrast chest CT scans could be associated with a higher rate of APE. The TSS of our patients' CT scans was on average 7/20, with no significant difference between the two groups. Only one (8%) patient in the APE group had a TSS greater than 10 and five (38%) had minimal lung damage with a score lower than 5. As for the TSS, our study did not show any significant difference concerning the type of lung lesions detected in COVID-19 patients with or without APE. Non-contrast chest CT therefore does not make it possible to differentiate the patients requiring complementary CTPA to search for APE. It is worth noting that in our protocol, CTPA was performed using breath-holding apnea without deep inspiration in order to obtain an optimal opacification of the pulmonary arteries by avoiding transient interruption of contrast. But this acquisition without deep inspiration leads to ventilatory disturbances impeding detailed analysis of the pulmonary parenchyma, in particular the GGO. The unenhanced series with deep inspiration therefore remains necessary in order to have an optimal analysis of the pulmonary parenchyma for COVID-19 pneumonia (Fig. 3).\nAlthough the radiological manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia does not allow for the selection of patients at risk of APE, we found a significantly higher D-dimer level in the APE group compared with the non-APE group. The D-dimer level seems to be an important parameter in the management of COVID-19 patients, making it possible both to assess the severity of the disease and to suspect APE. Given that the increase in the D-dimer level can be linked to COVID-19, it would be interesting to evaluate on the basis of large-scale studies if there is a cut-off D-dimer level at which CTPA could be recommended to search for APE in COVID-19 patients. Pending further data on D-dimer levels, we believe that all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and an increased level of D-dimer should benefit from CTPA to eliminate APE, whenever possible.\nOur study had several limitations. First, the number of patients included was small. Other large-scale studies are needed to confirm our results and analyze whether other factors could help optimize the indications for CTPA in COVID-19 patients. Second, certain medical or biological data were not available due to the retrospective nature of our study. Third, our study did not include a control group to compare the prevalence of APE in a group of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia versus other types of pneumonia. Fourth, no venous doppler ultrasound was performed to assess deep vein thrombosis that could explain the etiopathogenesis of APE in some cases. Finally, the CTPA quality scores showed that 36% of CT scans had an interpretation score of 3, i.e., not optimal for the analysis of all the pulmonary arteries. This was mainly due to respiratory artifacts in patients with dyspnea. It is therefore difficult to totally exclude the possibility that some patients may have had distal APE not seen in the CTPA.\nIn conclusion, our study showed an 18% prevalence of APE in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients referred to CTPA by the emergency department. COVID-19 patients with APE were older and had higher D-dimer levels. No significant difference was found in the severity of pulmonary involvement in CT. More studies are needed to determine which COVID-19 patients require CTPA as a complement to the non-contrast chest CT scan.\nAbbreviations\nAPE\nAcute pulmonary embolism\nCOVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 19\nCTPA\nComputed tomography pulmonary angiography\nGGO\nGround-glass opacity\nRT-PCR\nReverse transcription polymerase chain reaction\nPublisher's note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nFunding information\nThe authors state that this work has not received any funding.\nCompliance with ethical standards\nGuarantor\nThe scientific guarantor of this publication is Dr. GERVAISE Alban.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors of this manuscript declare no relationships with any companies, whose products or services may be related to the subject matter of the article.\nStatistics and biometry\nOne of the authors (GERVAISE Alban) has significant statistical expertise.\nInformed consent\nWritten informed consent was not required for this study because of the retrospective design of the study.\nEthical approval\nInstitutional Review Board approval was obtained.\nMethodology\n  retrospective\n  observational\n  performed at one institution\nReferences\nYang W, Sirajuddin A, Zhang X et al (2020) The role of imaging in 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).

a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Early reports describe high venous thromboembolism (VTE) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) rates, but data are limited. This multicenter retrospective study describes the rate and severity of hemostatic and thrombotic complications of 400 hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients (144 critically ill) primarily receiving standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation. Coagulation and inflammatory parameters were compared between patients with and without coagulation-associated complications. Multivariable logistic models examined the utility of these markers in predicting coagulation-associated complications, critical illness, and death. The radiographically confirmed VTE rate was 4.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-7.3), and the overall thrombotic complication rate was 9.5% (95% CI, 6.8-12.8). The overall and major bleeding rates were 4.8% (95% CI, 2.9-7.3) and 2.3% (95% CI, 1.0-4.2), respectively.

DIC, clinically relevant thrombocytopenia, and reduced fibrinogen were rare and were associated with significant bleeding manifestations. Given the observed bleeding rates, randomized trials are needed to determine any potential benefit of intensified anticoagulant prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients.\nKey Points\nIn addition to thrombotic complications, bleeding is a significant cause of morbidity in patients with COVID-19.\nD-dimer elevation at admission was predictive of bleeding, thrombosis, critical illness, and death in patients with COVID-19.\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first identified in Wuhan, China in December of 2019, has become a worldwide pandemic with widespread illness and mortality and a profound impact on society, culture, and the global economy. Although respiratory compromise is the cardinal feature of the disease, early studies have suggested that elevated circulating D-dimer levels are associated with mortality, suggesting a distinct coagulation disorder associated with COVID-19. In support of this hypothesis are recent autopsy studies of COVID-19 patients demonstrating the presence of fibrin thrombi within distended small vessels and capillaries and extensive extracellular fibrin deposition. \nGiven the ongoing global pandemic, there is an urgent need to understand the rate of bleeding and thrombotic manifestations associated with COVID-19 coagulopathy, as well as the clinical utility of abnormal coagulation testing to predict risk for bleeding, thrombosis, and severity of illness. In addition to D-dimer, a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) has been associated with decreased survival and increased need for critical care. On the basis of laboratory findings, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been reported to develop in &gt;70% of patients who succumb to the infection. Other retrospective studies have reported thrombotic rates in excess of 20% to 30%, but use of prophylactic anticoagulation was not consistent between studies. \nThe high venous thromboembolism (VTE) rates reported in these early studies have prompted some investigators to recommend empiric escalation of anticoagulation doses used for prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients. A recently published expert opinion guidance statement did not reach a consensus on whether standard prophylactic dose or escalated anticoagulation was optimal to prevent thrombotic events. Despite the lack of a clear picture of thrombotic risk or any studies describing bleeding manifestations, several institutions have recently released guidance statements, both internal only and externally published, recommending the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at intermediate or therapeutic doses or unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusions in COVID-19 patients with elevated D-dimer levels but no known thrombotic complications. Other commentaries have argued against empiric escalation of anticoagulation. \nTherefore, the primary goal of this study was to describe the rate of bleeding and thrombotic complications in a large multicenter cohort of critically ill and noncritically ill COVID-19 patients. In addition, given the previously demonstrated associations between coagulation and inflammatory parameters and mortality in COVID-19 patients, we investigated these markers as predictors of thrombosis and bleeding and examined the relationship between inflammation and coagulopathic complications in COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients and data collection\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Partners Healthcare (approval PHS/2020P000994). All patients aged &gt;=18 years with confirmed COVID-19 (defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test by nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab or sputum specimen) from 1 March 2020 through 5 April 2020 who had a D-dimer test performed on initial presentation with COVID-19 were identified using the Research Patient Data Registry at Partners Healthcare, a large multi-institutional patient data registry. The D-dimer test was used to identify a population of interest for this study because participating institutions had instituted routine D-dimer testing at initial evaluation in all admitted COVID-19 patients during the early days of the pandemic. Data were obtained retrospectively from patients treated at 5 Partners Healthcare institutions (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, Newton-Wellesley Hospital, and Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital) by manual chart review of the electronic medical record with a data cutoff date of 8 April 2020. Patient data collected included demographics, relevant comorbidities, need for hospital admission, need for endotracheal intubation, hospital length of stay, completion of hospitalization (hospital discharge and death), bleeding events, arterial and venous thrombotic events, anticoagulation administered, and coagulation and inflammatory laboratory parameters.\nBleeding and thrombotic events\nThe incidence of bleeding and thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients was assessed. Bleeding events were graded according to the modified World Health Organization (WHO) grading system. Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were confirmed radiographically. Synchronously diagnosed DVT and PE in the same patient were considered 1 VTE event. Also collected were cases of presumed VTE unable to be confirmed radiographically (because of an inability to perform the necessary test secondary to diagnostic limitations imposed by this infection) but for whom all of the following criteria were satisfied: (1) clinical evidence consistent with VTE on vital signs, physical examination, hemodynamic monitoring, or electrocardiogram; (2) a strong clinical suspicion on the part of the treating attending physician; and (3) therapeutic anticoagulation was initiated as a result of high clinical suspicion. Cases meeting these criteria underwent independent validation by 2 chart reviewers (H.A.-S. and R.P.R.); unless stated otherwise, they were included in VTE analyses. Myocardial infarction was diagnosed utilizing clinical criteria plus biomarker elevation and electrocardiographic changes; biomarker elevation in the absence of other clinical criteria was not considered a myocardial event.\nClinically significant nonvessel thrombotic complications potentially representative of a systemic hypercoagulable state were also collected. These include &gt;=2 occurrences of intraluminal central venous catheter or arterial line clotting necessitating line replacement to a new site or &gt;=2 occurrences of clotting of the continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) circuit in a 24-hour period in patients requiring renal replacement therapy that was deemed sufficiently problematic to initiate therapeutic systemic anticoagulation.\nAnalysis of coagulation and inflammatory parameters\nResults of 6 routinely drawn coagulation-based laboratory parameters (PT, international normalized ratio [INR], activated partial thromboplastin time [PTT], D-dimer, fibrinogen, and platelet count), 4 laboratory measures of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], ferritin, and procalcitonin), and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin were evaluated and compared between patients with thrombotic complications (composite of venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism, and clinically significant nonvessel thrombotic complications), patients with bleeding complications, and patients without bleeding or thrombotic complications. Specific assay methodology and manufacturer information are listed in supplemental Table 2, available on the Blood Web site. Initial values on presentation, minimum values, and peak values for each parameter were compared in patients with thrombotic complications and patients without coagulation-associated complications, as well as in patients with bleeding complications and patients without coagulation-associated complications, using the Mann-Whitney U test. Using these data, correlations between peak values of D-dimer and inflammatory markers for each patient (irrespective of the timing of measurement) were assessed with Spearman correlation coefficients.\nPredictors of bleeding events, thrombotic events, critical illness, and death\nUnivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate whether coagulation or inflammatory parameters drawn during initial clinical evaluation were predictive of bleeding events or thrombotic events diagnosed during hospitalization. These analyses were also performed to evaluate whether these parameters were predictive of critical illness or death. The thrombotic, bleeding, and critical illness models included all patients, and the mortality models included only patients reaching completion of hospitalization (discharge or death). Each parameter was evaluated in a univariable (unadjusted) model and a multivariable (adjusted) model controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), baseline anticoagulation intensity (mechanical thromboprophylaxis only/standard prophylactic anticoagulation [supplemental Table 1], or intermediate/full-dose anticoagulation), and clinical risk factors previously demonstrated to impart a high risk for severe COVID-19: chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis, chronic liver disease, and residence in a long-term care facility (see supplemental Table 3 for additional details regarding these risk factors). Laboratory parameters were not adjusted for one another. Thresholds used in models for each biomarker were selected based on a combination of biological relevance, laboratory reference ranges, and the distribution of the data.\nFollowing these primary analyses, which included all thrombotic complications or bleeding events, any coagulation or inflammatory parameters significantly predictive of thrombotic complications or bleeding were evaluated further in sensitivity analyses. The thrombosis sensitivity analysis included only patients with radiographically confirmed DVT, PE, or arterial thrombosis, as well as myocardial infarction; the bleeding sensitivity analysis included only major bleeding events (WHO grade 3 or 4).\nCritical illness was defined throughout the study as a requirement for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation; this included patients for whom intubation was clinically indicated but who chose to forego it (those with a &quot;do not intubate&quot; status).\nStatistical analysis software\nStatistical analysis was performed, and graphs for figures were prepared, using Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX), GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad, Inc., San Diego, CA), and Microsoft Excel 360 (Microsoft Corp., Seattle, WA). Missing data were not imputed. Any results above the upper limit of the assay were entered as 1 unit higher than the assay upper limit value for all analyses using continuous variables. The threshold for statistical significance (P &lt; .05) was not adjusted for multiple comparisons.\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nBaseline characteristics of patients included in the study (N = 400)\nCharacteristic	Admitted, not critically ill (n = 256)	Critically ill (n = 144)	 	Age, mean (range), y	60 (23-99)	65 (32-97)	 	Female, %	47.3	35.4	 	Race			 	 White	148 (57.8)	95 (66.0)	 	 Black	43 (16.8)	17 (11.8)	 	 Asian or Pacific islander	13 (5.1)	6 (4.2)	 	 Other	42 (16.4)	15 (10.4)	 	 Not specified	10 (3.9)	11 (7.6)	 	Ethnicity, Hispanic or Latino	74 (28.9)	42 (29.2)	 	Hospitalization status			 	 Discharged	205 (80.1)	18 (12.5)	 	 Still admitted at end of study period	49 (19.1)	99 (68.75)	 	 Deceased	2 (0.8)	27 (18.75)	 	Hospital length of stay, mean (range), d			 	 Hospitalization complete	6 (1-24)	9 (2-23)	 	 Hospitalization ongoing	8 (2-18)	12 (3-33)	 	Baseline anticoagulation			 	 None (mechanical thromboprophylaxis only)	9 (3.5)	2 (1.4)	 	 Standard prophylactic anticoagulation*	230 (89.8)	124 (86.1)	 	 Intermediate or full-dose anticoagulation 	17 (6.6)	18 (12.5)	 	BMI, kg/m2			 	 Underweight (&lt;18.5)	3 (1.2)	0 (0.0)	 	 Normal weight (18.5-24.9)	55 (21.5)	28 (19.5)	 	 Overweight (25.0-29.9)	95 (37.1)	54 (37.5)	 	 Class I obesity (30.0-34.9)	56 (21.9)	29 (20.1)	 	 Class II obesity (35.0-39.9)	29 (11.3)	20 (13.9)	 	 Class III obesity (&gt;=40.0)	18 (7.0)	13 (9.0)	 	Risk factors for severe COVID-19			 	 Cardiovascular disease	82 (32.0)	43 (29.9)	 	 Chronic lung disease	53 (20.7)	25 (17.4)	 	 Diabetes mellitus	65 (25.4)	58 (40.3)	 	 Immune compromise or suppression	29 (11.3)	20 (13.9)	 	 Chronic kidney disease on dialysis	4 (1.6)	6 (4.2)	 	 Chronic liver disease	13 (5.1)	6 (4.2)	 	 Reside in nursing home or long-term care facility	21 (8.2)	7 (4.9)	 		 	\nUnless otherwise noted, data are n (%).\nDetails are in supplemental Table 1.\nIncludes patients continuing on previously prescribed oral anticoagulants and patients with BMI &lt;30 kg/m2 given subcutaneous enoxaparin at higher-than-standard dosing (eg, 40 mg, twice daily).\nAmong 429 patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test and a D-dimer test obtained on initial evaluation, 400 were admitted to the hospital and included in the study (supplemental Figure 1). Table 1 lists baseline patient characteristics by severity group (noncritically ill and critically ill). The study included a total of 3226 patient-days (461 patient-weeks) analyzed, including 1608 patient-days (230 patient-weeks) in noncritically ill patients and 1618 patient-days (231 patient-weeks) in critically ill patients.\nThrombotic events and event rates\nVenous thromboembolism\nThe rate of radiographically confirmed VTE was 4.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-7.3, including 19 events in 19 patients), or 4.13 per 100 patient-weeks. This included a rate of 3.1% (95% CI, 1.4-6.1), or 3.49 per 100 patient-weeks, in noncritically ill patients and 7.6% (95% CI, 3.9-13.3), or 4.76 per 100 patient-weeks, in critically ill patients. The overall VTE rate (including suspected VTEs unable to be confirmed radiographically that met criteria for inclusion detailed in &quot;Methods&quot;) was 6.0% (95% CI, 3.9-8.8; 24 events in 24 patients), or 5.22 per 100 patient-weeks. This included a rate of 3.5% (95% CI, 1.6-6.6), or 3.91 per 100 patient-weeks, in noncritically ill patients and 10.4% (95% CI, 5.9-16.6), or 6.49 per 100 patient-weeks, in critically ill patients.\nEvents confirmed on imaging included 4 patients with proximal lower extremity DVT, 2 with line-associated internal jugular DVT, 2 with extensive superficial venous thrombosis, 1 with extensive upper extremity DVT, 6 with proximal (lobar or segmental) PE, 1 with distal (subsegmental) PE, and 3 with both DVT and PE. Suspected VTE events included 2 patients with suspected DVT and 3 patients with suspected PE. All but 1 of the patients were receiving anticoagulation with standard prophylactic doses (supplemental Table 1) of UFH or LMWH at the time of the event; 1 patient was receiving therapeutic-dose apixaban at the time of the event. Two patients with VTE also had arterial thrombotic events. There were no fatal VTE events.\nArterial thrombosis\nThe arterial thrombosis rate was 2.8% (95% CI, 1.4-4.9; including 11 events in 11 patients), or 2.39 per 100 patient-weeks. This included a rate of 1.2% (95% CI, 0.2-3.4), or 1.30 per 100 patient-weeks, in noncritically ill patients and 5.6% (95% CI, 2.4-10.7), or 3.46 per 100 patient-weeks, in critically ill patients. Events included 9 patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, 1 patient with unstable angina, and 1 patient with bilateral line-associated radial artery thromboses. All patients were receiving anticoagulation with prophylactic doses of UFH or LMWH at the time of the event. There were no fatal arterial thrombotic events.\nClinically significant nonvessel thrombotic complications\nOf 12 critically ill patients placed on CVVH, 8 had recurrent clotting of the CVVH circuit while receiving prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, resulting in a change to therapeutic-dose heparin infusion; 2 had continued recurrent clotting of the circuit despite therapeutic-dose heparin infusion. Of note, 5 of these 8 patients also had venous or arterial thrombotic events. Of the 4 patients receiving CVVH who did not have recurrent clotting of the CVVH circuit, 3 were on a therapeutic-dose heparin infusion for other indications at the time the CVVH was initiated.\nTwo additional critically ill patients had recurrent thrombosis of central venous catheters and arterial lines necessitating repeat replacement of lines for ongoing care. There were no fatal complications of nonvessel thrombosis.\nOverall thrombotic complication rate and management\nThe overall thrombotic complication rate was 9.5% (95% CI, 6.8-12.8; 45 events in 38 patients), or 9.78 per 100 patient-weeks. This included a rate of 4.7% (95% CI, 2.4-8.0), or 5.22 per 100 patient-weeks, in noncritically ill patients and a rate of 18.1% (95% CI, 12.1-25.3), or 14.29 per 100 patient-weeks, in critically ill patients. Forty-one patients (10%) were transitioned from prophylactic-dose to therapeutic-dose anticoagulation during admission to manage thrombotic complications and/or new-onset atrial fibrillation. Four patients with thrombotic complications also developed bleeding complications.\nBleeding events and event rates\nBleeding events\nBleeding events\nPatient sex	Age, y	Critically ill	Type(s) of bleeding	Platelet count at bleed(s), x109/L	Anticoagulation at bleed(s)	WHO grade(s)	Comments	 	Male	67	Yes	GI	47	Therapeutic (UFH)	2	On anticoagulation for pulmonary embolus and clotting of CVVH circuit at time of bleed	 	Male	59	No	Hemoptysis	134	None	1	Recurrent	 	Male	62	Yes	GI	242	Prophylactic (UFH)	3		 	Male	37	No	Hemoptysis	426	Prophylactic (enoxaparin)	2		 	Male	68	Yes	Oral mucosa bleeding	227	Prophylactic (enoxaparin)	2	Recurrent	 	Male	56	No	Epistaxis	208	Prophylactic (enoxaparin)	2	Recurrent	 	Male	49	Yes	Epistaxis; bleeding from multiple cannulation sites	115; 184	Prophylactic (enoxaparin) for both events	3; 1	Epistaxis recurrent and required otolaryngology consult and prolonged packing; DIC	 	Male	59	Yes	Bleeding from multiple cannulation sites; intracranial hemorrhage	155; 257	Therapeutic (UFH) for both events	1; 4	Fatal intracranial hemorrhage; DIC	 	Female	65	Yes	Internal bleeding	177	Prophylactic (UFH)	3	Recurrent; strong clinical suspicion of internal bleeding due to rapidly declining hemoglobin (&gt;2 g/dL drop each time requiring transfusion) with no other cause (unable to scan)	 	Male	69	Yes	Oropharyngeal bleeding from tongue mass	414	Prophylactic (UFH)	2	Recurrent; required consult from otolaryngology and prolonged oral packing.

This included a rate of 3.1% (95% CI, 1.4-6.1), or 3.49 per 100 patient-weeks, in noncritically ill patients and 7.6% (95% CI, 3.9-13.3), or 5.63 per 100 patient-weeks, in critically ill patients. The major bleeding (WHO grade 3-4) rate was 2.3% (95% CI, 1.0-4.2), or 1.96 per 100 patient-weeks. All but 1 major bleed occurred in the critically ill, for a rate of 5.6% (95% CI, 2.4-10.7), or 3.46 per 100 patient-weeks. Events are described in detail in Table 2 . One bleeding event, an intracranial hemorrhage, was fatal.\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation\nThree patients were diagnosed with DIC on the basis of clinical and laboratory evidence of DIC; all had grade 3 or 4 bleeding events (Table 2).

Analysis was limited to those patients reaching a terminal end point (hospital discharge or death) by the end of the study period (n = 252). aPTT, activated PTT.\nElevations in D-dimer, platelet count, CRP, and ESR at initial presentation were predictive of thrombotic complications during hospitalization (Figure 2 ); in multivariable analysis, D-dimer of 1001 to 2500 ng/mL had an odds ratio (OR) for thrombotic complications of 3.04 (95% CI, 1.26-7.31), and a D-dimer &gt;2500 ng/mL had an OR of 6.79 (95% CI, 2.39-19.30; P &lt; .001). Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;150 x 109/L) and elevations in D-dimer &gt;2500 ng/mL at initial presentation were also predictive of bleeding complications during hospitalization (Figure 3 ) (in multivariable analysis, for platelet count &lt;150 x 109/L: OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.05-7.99; and for D-dimer &gt;2500 ng/mL: OR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.01-12.66). Elevations in D-dimer, CRP, ESR, ferritin, procalcitonin, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin at initial presentation were predictive of critical illness during hospitalization in multivariable analysis (Figure 4 ). Elevations in D-dimer, PT, activated PTT, fibrinogen, CRP, ESR, and procalcitonin at initial presentation were predictive of death during hospitalization in multivariable analysis (Figure 5 ).\nIn the thrombosis sensitivity analysis, D-dimer, platelet count, and CRP elevations on presentation were similarly predictive of thrombotic complications in multivariable analysis (supplemental Table 4). In the bleeding sensitivity analysis, when limiting cases to major bleeds only, thrombocytopenia at presentation was still predictive of bleeding in multivariable analysis but D-dimer &gt;2500 ng/mL was no longer a statistically significant predictor (OR, 4.73; 95% CI, 0.85-26.21; P = .076) (supplemental Table 5).\nDiscussion\nIn this multicenter study, we report the hemostatic manifestations and bleeding and thrombotic complications of 400 COVID-19 patients. In a population managed with standard doses of prophylactic anticoagulation, we found a radiographically confirmed venous thromboembolic rate of 4.8% (7.6% in critically ill patients), far lower than other published studies from China or Europe and more consistent with another study from the United States. Including events unconfirmed on imaging but with objective clinical findings that were managed as VTE, arterial thrombotic events, and clinically significant nonvessel thrombotic complications, such as CVVH circuit thrombosis, we found an overall thrombotic complication rate of 9.5%. In contrast, the observed overall bleeding rate was 4.8% (7.6% in the critically ill), with a major bleeding rate of 2.3% (5.6% in the critically ill, including 1 fatal bleed). Although occult thromboembolic events may be possible or even likely in critically ill COVID-19 patients who are unable to undergo diagnostic imaging, given the observed bleeding rates, our data suggest that empiric intensification of anticoagulation in even critically ill COVID-19 patients, beyond that of the general standard of care, should be pursued with caution. Our findings suggest that any potential benefit of anticoagulation doses beyond the general standard of care in patients with COVID-19 is best evaluated in a randomized study. The one current exception suggested by our findings are those patients receiving renal replacement therapy with CVVH who experience multiple episodes of circuit failure due to coagulation. Several randomized studies comparing the intensity of prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 have been listed on clinicaltrials.gov, and several (NCT04359277, NCT04362085, NCT04345848, NCT04366960) have begun enrollment. In addition to thrombosis prevention, outcomes under evaluation include all-cause mortality and incidence of other complications, such as respiratory failure, shock, and renal injury.\nContrary to the findings of at least one other published study of COVID-19 patients, we found a very low rate of DIC (2% of critically ill patients) using a combination of clinical assessment and laboratory parameters, as defined by the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis. D-dimer levels were increased far out of proportion to any abnormalities in the PT/INR, activated PTT, fibrinogen level, or platelet count (Table 3); these findings are uncharacteristic of DIC as currently understood. It is worth noting that elevated levels of D-dimer are common in hospitalized and critically ill patients more generally and are not routinely measured and scrutinized on a daily basis in other patients as is currently being done in patients with COVID-19. We observed that clinically relevant thrombocytopenia was rare, and reductions in fibrinogen below the assay reference range were extremely rare. However, when these hemostatic defects did occur, major bleeding was common (Table 2).\nWe additionally found that elevations in D-dimer on admission predicted critical illness and death, as well as bleeding and thrombotic complications. Inflammatory markers, including CRP and ESR, were also associated with thrombosis (Figure 2), and elevations in several coagulation and inflammatory markers were associated with critical illness and mortality (Figure 4, Figure 5), albeit with a high degree of uncertainty in the mortality models, as manifested by very wide confidence intervals. Acute inflammation, as measured by elevations in these markers, has previously been associated with increased thrombotic and bleeding risk in patients without COVID-19; indeed, we found significant correlations between D-dimer levels and each measured inflammatory marker (Figure 1). Given previously reported 14-day cumulative VTE rates of 7% to 8% in critically ill patients without COVID-19 receiving standard heparin-based thromboprophylaxis, our observed rate of 7.6% in critically ill patients receiving similar prophylactic treatment over a median follow-up of 10 days was comparable. Likewise, to contextualize our major bleeding rate of 5.6% in the critically ill, a large prospective study of bleeding events in 3746 critically ill patients without COVID-19 identified major bleeding (defined similarly as in our study) in 208 patients (5.6%). Given these findings, the question arises as to whether the underlying cause of the elevated D-dimer levels and bleeding and thrombotic manifestations are due to a pathophysiologically distinct viral coagulopathy or simply related to coagulation system activation in the setting of severe inflammation.\nThe limitations of this retrospective observational study are evident. Without a uniform protocol to image all patients with suspected VTE, thrombotic events may have been missed. Conversely, despite relatively stringent criteria for inclusion, the included suspected VTE events that were not confirmed radiologically may not have been true VTE events. Low-grade bleeds considered relatively trivial may not have been documented in the medical record. In the absence of routine bronchoscopy, pulmonary bleeding, including focal or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, could have been missed and misinterpreted as worsening pulmonary infection or inflammation. Although the study included 400 patients with confirmed COVID-19, bleeds and thrombotic events occurred in a small number of patients, resulting in wider confidence intervals for the ORs describing associations with these outcomes. Laboratory data were not uniformly available for every evaluated laboratory parameter and were not collected in each patient according to a standardized timing or protocol.\nIn conclusion, we observed that COVID-19 was associated with similar rates of thrombosis and bleeding as seen in hospitalized patients with similar degrees of critical illness. Elevated D-dimer levels at initial presentation predicted bleeding complications, thrombotic complications, critical illness, and death. Beyond D-dimer, thrombosis was primarily associated with inflammatory markers rather than coagulation parameters. Randomized clinical trials are necessary to determine the optimal dose and course of thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19.\nREFERENCES\nClinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China\nClinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study\nFox SE, Akmatbekov A, Harbert JL, Li G, Brown JQ, Vander Heide RS,.

CoronavirusInfected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

Apart from respiratory failure, coagulopathy is a common abnormality in patients with COVID-19, with elevated levels of both fibrinogen and D-dimers. Therefore, experts have recently published a statement on the management of coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients suggesting to consider prophylactic doses of low molecular weight heparin in all COVID-19 patients. However, the evidence is scarce and we found only two studies reporting the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in severe COVID-19 patients. One study report a 27% rate of VTE in COVID-19 patients, but without systematic assessment. Another recent study report a 25% incidence rate of VTE using systematic assessment in COVID-19 patients, but without thromboprophylaxis. We here report our experience with systematic assessment of VTE using complete duplex ultrasound (CDU) in severe ICU COVID-19 patients.\nMETHODS\nFrom March 19 to April 11, 2020, we performed a retrospective study in two French ICUs where CDU is usually performed upon admission as a standard of care. The COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed by RNA detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with respiratory failure. Characteristics at baseline, biological findings, and CDU results were extracted from electronic hospital medical records. Independent certified specialists in vascular medicine performed CDU between day 1 and day 3 after admission. In patients without VTE during the first CDU, a second CDU was performed at day 7. According to guidelines, a CDU is performed from thigh to ankle at selected sites with Doppler waveforms and images. Anticoagulation dose was left to the discretion of the treating physician based on the individual risk of thrombosis and patients were classified as treated with prophylactic anticoagulation or therapeutic anticoagulation. Patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation received either low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin with anti-Xa monitoring, with therapeutic levels of 0.3 to 0.7 U/mL of anti-Xa activity. Pulmonary embolism was systematically researched in case of persistent or secondary respiratory failure by computed tomography pulmonary angiogram or transesophageal echocardiography when patients were not transportable. Continuous variables were expressed as median (interquartile range) and categorical variables as numbers (percentages) and were compared by the Pearson chi-squared test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. According to French law, this study was registered (MR141210420) and patients were informed at ICU discharge.\nRESULTS\nMain characteristics of the patients at baseline\nTable 1	 	\nCharacteristics	All (n = 26)	Prophylactic Anticoagulation at Admission (n = 8)	Therapeutic Anticoagulation at Admission (n = 18)	P	 	Characteristics at baseline	 	Age (years)	68 (51.5-74.5)	68 (45-72.7)	67.5 (53.5-76.2)		 	Male sex	20 (77)	6 (75)	14 (78)		 	Chronic medical condition	 	Active cancer	0 (0)	0 (0)	0 (0)		 	Previous VTE	1 (4)	0 (0)	1 (6)		 	Arterial hypertension	22 (85)	7 (87)	15 (83)		 	Tobacco	7 (27)	2 (25)	5 (28)		 	Surgery &lt; 3 months	1 (4)	0 (0)	1 (6)		 	Anticoagulation before admission	7 (27)	0 (0)	7 (39)	.06	 	Days between symptom onset and admission	7 (3.2-8.7)	7 (6.2-9.2)	5.5 (3-8)		 	SOFA score	3 (2-4.7)	2.5 (2-3.2)	3.5 (3-5)	.06	 	Laboratory findings at admission	 	D-dimers, ng/mL	1750 (1130-2850)	2330 (1495-3165)	1750 (1245-2850)		 	Fibrinogen, g/L	7 (6.4-7.4)	7.1 (6.9-8.3)	6.8 (6.4-7.3)		 	Platelets count, G/L	234 (169-306)	261 (159-316)	234 (185-293.5)		 	CRP, mg/L	187 (147-279)	197 (155-287)	177 (147.5-258.5)		 	Hematocrit, %	37.7 (35.9-41.9)	41.2 (39.2-42.3)	36.5 (34.8-40.2)		 	Creatininemia, mumol/L	79.5 (55.7-100)	86 (81.5-97)	94.5 (59.7-103)	.02	 	Management	 	Worse PaO2/FiO2 ratio	86.5 (74-116)	106 (82-115)	78 (70-117)		 	Mechanical ventilation	26 (100)	8 (100)	18 (100)		 	Prone positioning	16 (62)	5 (62)	11 (61)		 	Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation	2 (8)	1 (12)	1 (5)		 	Renal replacement therapy	4 (15)	0 (0)	4 (22)		 	Vasoconstrictive agent	23 (88)	8 (100)	15 (83)		 	Antibacterial treatment	25 (96)	7 (87)	18 (100)		 	Complete duplex ultrasound findings	 	Venous thromboembolism	18 (69)	8 (100)	10 (56)	.03	 	Superficial	4 (22)	2 (25)	3 (30)		 	Deep	14 (78)	6 (75)	7 (10)		 	Bilateral	10 (55)	5 (63)	5 (50)		 	Outcome	 	ARDS	21 (81)	7 (87)	14 (78)		 	Pulmonary embolisma	6 (23)	0 (0)	6 (33)		 	Acute kidney injury	9 (35)	2 (25)	7 (39)		 	Liver dysfunction	4 (15)	1 (12)	3 (17)		 	Death	3 (12)	1 (12)	2 (11)		 	\nAbbreviations: ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; CRP, C-reactive protein; SAPSII, simplified acute physiology score II; SOFA, sequential organ failure assessment; VTE, venous thromboembolism.\nAngio-computed tomography scan in 4 patients and transesophageal echocardiography in 2 patients.\nDuring the study period, 26 COVID-19 patients were admitted in our ICUs. Main clinical characteristics at baseline and biological findings are reported in Table 1 . Patients were mostly men (n = 20, 77%), had a previous history of arterial hypertension (n = 22, 85%), and had an increased body mass index (median = 30.2 kg/m2, 25th-75th interquartile range [IQR]: 25.5, 33.5). The median value of fibrinogen at admission was 7 g/L (25th-75th IQR: 6.4, 7.4) and the median D-dimer value was 1750 ng/mL (25th-75th IQR: 1130, 2850). All patients underwent mechanical ventilation, with prone positioning in 16 patients (62%). All patients were anticoagulated from admission, with 31% (n = 8) with prophylactic anticoagulation and 69% (n = 18) with therapeutic anticoagulation (Table 1). We found a cumulative incidence of peripheral VTE of 69% (n = 18), and pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in six patients (23%). The overall mortality was 12%, 16 patients were discharged from the ICU, and seven continued to receive mechanical ventilation. The proportion of VTE was significantly higher in patients treated with prophylactic anticoagulation when compared with the other group (100% vs 56%, respectively, P = .03). However, we found a high rate of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation, with 56% of VTE and six pulmonary embolisms.\nDISCUSSION\nUsing a systematic VTE screening strategy, we found a 69% incidence rate of VTE in severe ICU anticoagulated COVID-19 patients. Whether a recent study reports a lower rate of VTE, our results differ by two major points: (1) other authors did not perform systematic CDU and therefore may underestimate the rate of VTE and (2) all patients in our cohort are mechanically ventilated with a high proportion of acute respiratory distress syndrome, whereas patients from the other reports are less ill. In another recent study, authors report a 25% incidence rate of VTE using systematic assessment in COVID-19 patients, but without thromboprophylaxis. Moreover, the exact time point of the venous Doppler ultrasound and whether a certified specialist performed it are unclear in this study. Nevertheless, these two studies underline the importance of venous thromboembolic events in severe COVID-19 patients. Surprisingly, we found that VTE even occur in patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation from admission, highlighting the thrombogenicity of COVID-19. Moreover, 23% of patients were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism, pointing out the importance of considering VTE complications in COVID-19 patients. This study is limited in the small number of patients and the retrospective design of the study. However, given the systematic VTE screening strategy and the severity of the anticoagulated patients, our results support to consider routine screening of VTE in severe ICU COVID-19 patients in the pandemic context and suggest taking into consideration early therapeutic anticoagulation in this setting.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nNone.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nJean-Francois Llitjos designed the study, collected data, and wrote the manuscript.
