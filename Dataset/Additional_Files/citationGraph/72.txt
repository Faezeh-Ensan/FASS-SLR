As of Feb 19, 2020, the total number of patients has risen sharply to 74 283 in the mainland of China, with 2009 (2 7%) deceased. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically ill cases. Previous studies have only described the general epidemiological findings, clinical presentation, and clinical outcomes of patients of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. However, specific information characterising critically ill patients remains unknown.\nThe data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are scarce, but are of paramount importance to reduce mortality. In this study, we investigated critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital. The baseline SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity and mortality data from this study will be of considerable value for the early identification of individuals who are at risk of becoming critically ill and who are most likely to benefit from intensive care treatment.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThis single-centre, retrospective, observational study was done at Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China), which is a designated hospital to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. All patients, except infected healh-care workers from Jin Yin-tan hospital, were transferred from other hospitals. We retrospectively analysed patients from Dec 24, 2019, to Jan 26, 2020, who had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, according to WHO interim guidance, and who were critically ill. Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed by the local health authority as previously described. Critically ill patients were defined as those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) who required mechanical ventilation or had a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of at least 60% or more. Identification of critically ill patients was achieved by reviewing and analysing admission logs and histories from all available electronic medical records and patient care resources. For patients who were alive by Jan 26, 2020, their living status was confirmed on Feb 9, 2020.\nResearch in context\n Evidence before this study \nThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 is a disease that has affected populations around the world. We searched PubMed for articles published up to Feb 11, 2020, using the keywords &quot;2019 novel coronavirus&quot;, &quot;2019-nCoV&quot;, &quot;COVID-19&quot;, or &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;. We identified eight articles that describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, none of these studies focused on characterising critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, who are at increased risk of death.\n Added value of this study \nWe report the clinical courses and clinical outcomes of 52 critically ill patients from 710 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2. 35 (67%) patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 37 (71%) required mechanical ventilation. 32 (61 5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from intensive care unit (ICU) admission to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days in non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64 6 years [11 2] vs 51 9 years [12 9]), more likely to develop acute respiratory distress (ARDS; 26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n Implications of all the available evidence \nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at 28 days is considerable. The survival time of non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\nThe Ethics Commission of Jin Yin-tan hospital approved this study (KY-2020-06.01). Written informed consent was waived due to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.\nData collection\nWe reviewed clinical electronic medical records, nursing records, laboratory findings, and radiological examinations for all patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The admission data of these patients were collected. Data were evaluated and collected, by using a case record form modified from the standardised International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium case report forms. Any missing or uncertain records were collected and clarified through direct communication with involved health-care providers and their families.\nWe collected data on age, sex, exposure history, chronic medical histories (chronic cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic neurological disorder, diabetes, malignancy, dementia, malnutrition, and smoking), symptoms from onset to hospital admission (fever, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, malaise, rhinorrhoea, arthralgia, chest pain, headache, and vomiting), vital signs at ICU admission (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure), laboratory values on admission (haemoglobin concentration, lymphocyte count, platelet count, arterial blood gas analysis, FiO2, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), and lactate concentration), coexisted infection, treatment (oxygen therapy, vasoconstrictive agents, antiviral agents, antibacterial agents, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin), as well as living status. During the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the number of critically ill patients exceeded the capacity of ICUs. Therefore, two provisional ICUs were urgently established in Jin Yin-tan hospital and hence most mechanical ventilator settings and recordings were not recorded, except records of positive end-expiratory pressure in some cases. As a routine, electronic medical data were archived onto a local server, from which we retrieved these data.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was 28-day mortality after ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. ARDS and shock were defined according to the guidance of WHO for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute kidney injury was identified on the basis of serum creatinine. Cardiac injury was diagnosed if the serum concentration of hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hsTNI) was above the upper limit of the reference range (&gt;28 pg/mL), measured in the laboratory of Jin Yin-tan Hospital.\nStatistical analysis\nThe aim of this study is to report the clinical courses and clinical outcomes of critically ill patients being cared for in the hospital during the study period. There were, therefore, no formal hypotheses being implemented to drive the sample size calculation and we included the maximum number of patients who met the inclusion criteria.\nWe expressed descriptive data as mean (SD) or median (IQR) for continuous variables and number (%) for categorical variables. We assessed differences between survivors and non-survivors using two-sample t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test depending on parametric or non-parametric data for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. We used a Kaplan-Meier plot for survival data.\nTests were two-sided with significance set at alpha less than 0 05. The Stata/IC 15.1 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) was applied for all analyses.\nResults\nStudy flow diagram\nSARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Among 52 critically ill patients, six (11%) did not experienced fever until 2-8 days after the onset of symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median duration from onset of symptoms to radiological confirmation of pneumonia was 5 (IQR 3-7) days.

SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. SOFA=Sequential Organ Failure Assessment.\nThe median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of all patients was 17 (IQR 14-19; table 3 ). Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax (table 2). The median hsTNI was 161 0 (IQR 41 8-766 1) pg/mL. Hospital-acquired infection was noted in seven (13 5%) patients, including one (2%) patient who had pulmonary and blood stream infection of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Other microorganisms identified from respiratory tract secretions in five (10%) patients included Aspergillus flavus, A fumigatus, extended-spectrum beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-positive K pneumonia, ESBL-positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ESBL-negative Serratia marcescens, with each microorganism found in one patient each. Candida albicans was identified in the urine culture of one (2%) patient (table 2).\n33 (63 5%) patients were treated with high-flow nasal cannula, 37 (71%) with mechanical ventilation, six (11 5%) with prone position ventilation, six (11 5%) with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), nine (17%) with renal replacement therapy, and 18 (35%) with vasoconstrictive agents (table 2). 23 (44%) patients received antiviral agents, 49 (94%) received antibacterial agents, and 30 (58%) patients received glucocorticoids (table 2). Oseltamivir was given to 18 (35%) patients, ganciclovir to 14 (27%), and lopinavir to seven (13 5%).\nSurvival of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia\nDashed lines represent 95% CIs. One patient died within 24 h after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nFor the primary outcome, among 52 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 32 (61 5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from ICU admission to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days in the non-survivors (figure 2 ). Compared with survivors, non-survivors were more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] vs 9 [45%]) and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] vs 7 [35%]). 30 (81%) of 37 patients requiring mechanical ventilation had died by 28 days.\nOf the 20 patients who survived, eight patients were discharged. Three patients were still on invasive ventilation at 28 days, including one patient who was also on ECMO. One patient was on non-invasive ventilation, two were using high-flow nasal cannula, and six were using common nasal cannula.\nCompared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64 6 [SD 11 2] vs 51 9 [12 9]) and were more likely to have chronic medical illnesses (17 (53%) patients vs 4 (20%) patients; table 1). Neither the median duration from onset of symptoms to radiological confirmation of pneumonia or from onset of symptoms to ICU admission were different between survivors and non-survivors (table 3). The ratio of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to FiO2 was significantly lower in non-survivors. Based on APACHE II score and SOFA score at ICU admission, non-survivors were in a more critical condition than survivors. In the cohort, lymphocytopenia occurred in 44 (85%) patients, with no significant difference between the two groups. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were more likely to develop ARDS, and to receive mechanical ventilation, either invasively or non-invasively.\nDiscussion\nWe report on 52 critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterised by severe hypoxaemia. 32 (61 5%) of critically ill patients had died at 28 days. Of all included patients, 37 (71%) required mechanical ventilation and 35 (67%) had ARDS.\nSince no specialised medication to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified at this time, the mainstay of treatment has been supportive care. Patients are being treated in isolation, and their close contacts are being quarantined. For non-critically ill patients, close follow-up is likely to be sufficient to manage the disease. For critically ill patients, however, aggressive treatments and intensive care are needed. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterise critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. In three previously published studies of crtically ill patients, the patient numbers were too small to summarise the characteristics and mortality of these patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. \nLike SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that can be transmitted to humans, and these viruses are all related to high mortality in critically ill patients. However, the mortality rate in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort is higher than that previously seen in critically ill patients with SARS. In a cohort of 38 critically ill patients with SARS from 13 hospitals in Canada, 29 (76%) patients required mechanical ventilation, 13 (43%) patients had died at 28 days, and six (16%) patients remained on mechanical ventilation. 17 (38%) of 45 patients and 14 (26%) of 54 patients who were critically ill with SARS infection were also reported to have died at 28 days in a Singapore cohort and a Hong Kong cohort, respectively. The mortality rate in our cohort is likely to be higher than that seen in critically ill patients with MERS infection. In a cohort of 12 patients with MERS from two hospitals in Saudi Arabia, seven (58%) patients had died at 90 days. Since the follow-up time is shorter in our cohort, we postulate that the mortality rate would be higher after 28 days than that seen in patients with MERS-CoV.\nThe fundamental pathophysiology of severe viral pneumonia is severe ARDS. Men and people of an older age (&gt;65 years) are more likely to develop ARDS than women or those of a younger age. Therefore, it is reasonable that the mortality at 28 days of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is similar to the mortality of severe ARDS, which is near 50%. With a substantial increase in the number of critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, more provisional ICUs are being established in Wuhan, China. Qualified specialists are coming to Wuhan from other provinces of China and are currently working in these provisional ICUs, fever clinics, and newly constructed hospitals. As the clinical capacity to treat patients improves, the mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is expected to decrease.\nAs mentioned in previous studies, nearly 70% of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 were men. The patients are older in our study than in previous studies. We observed that non-survivors were older than survivors. Based on previous studies, evidence suggests that older, male patients are the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is supported by our data. As previously reported, patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease are at increased risk of becoming critically ill or dying if they have SARS-CoV-2 infection. \nIn our cohort, fever is the most common symptom in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, which is in accordance with previous studies, but not all patients had fever. We also found that fever was not detected at the onset of illness in six (11 5%), and that it was in fact detected 2-8 days later. The delay of fever manifestation hinders early identification of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2:if patients are asymptomatic identification of suspected cases is more difficult. The median duration from onset of symptoms to radiological confirmation of pneumonia was 5 (3-7) days, meaning that early or repeated radiological examinations are useful in screening patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. \nAs for laboratory tests, lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 80% of critically ill patients in our cohort. Lymphocytopenia is a prominent feature of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV infection because targeted invasion by SARS-CoV viral particles damages the cytoplasmic component of the lymphocyte and causes its destruction. Additionally, lymphocytopenia is also common in the critically ill patients with MERS infection, which is the result of apoptosis of lymphocytes. Therefore, we postulate that necrosis or apoptosis of lymphocytes also induces lymphocytopenia in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a previous study, mainly in non-critical patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, 35% of patients had only mild lymphocytopenia, suggesting that the severity of lymphocytopenia reflects the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMechanical ventilation is the main supportive treatment for critically ill patients. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio was lower in our patients than in patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital. The substantial difference in PaO2/FiO2 ratio between survivors and non-survivors in our study, indicates this ratio is associated with the severity of illness and thus prognosis. Barotrauma seems less severe in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are being mechanically ventilated than that seen in mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV. In our study, barotrauma occurred in only one (2%) patient, who had been hospitalised for nearly 1 month, and he is currently on a ventilator and receiving ECMO. In patients with SARS, barotrauma occurred in about 25% of patients on mechanical ventilation. The lower occurrence of barotrauma in our cohort is probably related to the widely accepted strategy of protective ventilation in mainland China. At the same time, prone position and ECMO have been used to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\nWithout solid evidence, nearly half of the patients were given antiviral agents, and more than half were given intravenous glucocorticoids. Patients treated with lopinavir were from an ongoing clinical trial registered on Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000029308). Remdesivir was given to the first patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA. Trials on remdesivir are about to recruit both mild to moderate patients (NCT04252664) and severe patients (NCT04257656) infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although, intravenous glucocorticoids were commonly used in patients with severe SARS or MERS pneumonia, their efficacy remains controversial and their use to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is also controversial. An ongoing clinical trial (NCT04244591) might shed some light on the safety and efficacy of these drugs as treatment.\nThis study has several limitations. First, only 52 critically ill patients were included. However, the population from which they were sampled was much larger than that of the three studies previously published. We included all the critically ill patients being cared for in the ICU of Jin Yin-tan hospital who met the inclusion criteria. Due to the exploratory nature of the study, which was not driven by formal hypotheses, the sample size calculation was waived. Instead, we hope that the findings presented here will encourage a larger cohort study or potentially some randomly controlled trials. Second, some specific information from the ICU was missing, such as mechanical ventilation settings. The data on radiographical examination, supportive treatment, living status, and the duration from ICU admission to death, however, are indisputable. Third, this is a retrospective study. The data in this study permit a preliminary assessment of the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Further studies are still needed.\nIn conclusion, the mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is high. The survival term of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain to hospital critical care resources, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n This online publication has been corrected.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been reported in Hong Kong.\n\n We investigated the viral cause and clinical presentation among 50 patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters.\n\n We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples.\n\n We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked.\n\n\nFindings\nPatients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years.\n\n Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints.\n\n When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild.\n\n Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease.\n\n A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients.\n\n By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nA coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease.\n\n Serological and molecular tests specific for the virus permitted a definitive laboratory diagnosis to be made and allowed further investigation to define whether other cofactors play a part in disease progression.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112372","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

An integrated database was constructed from several sources containing information on epidemiological, demographic, and clinical variables.\n\n We estimated the key epidemiological distributions: infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death, and admission to discharge.\n\n We measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patients’age and the time from onset to admission.\n\n\nFindings\nAfter the initial phase of exponential growth, the rate of confirmed cases fell to less than 20 per day by April 28. Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts.\n\n The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6.4 days (95% Cl 5.2–7.7).\n\n The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic.\n\n The estimated case fatality rate was 13.2% (9.8–16.8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43.3% (35.2–52.4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric ? distribution.\n\n A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6.8% (4.0–9.6) and 55.0% (45.3–64.7), respectively.\n\n Case clusters have played an important part in the course of the epidemic.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients’age was strongly associated with outcome.\n\n The time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital did not alter outcome, but shorter intervals will be important to the wider population by restricting the infectious period before patients are placed in quarantine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112380","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Christl A","surname":"Donnelly","email":"c.donnelly@imperial.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Azra C","surname":"Ghani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anthony J","surname":"Hedley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Fraser","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Steven","surname":"Riley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laith J","surname":"Abu-Raddad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lai-Ming","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thuan-Quoc","surname":"Thach","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patsy","surname":"Chau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"King-Pan","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tai-Hing","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lai-Yin","surname":"Tse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Tsang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-Haei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James HB","surname":"Kong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edith MC","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Neil M","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roy M","surname":"Anderson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2003) Updated interim US case definition for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-update, 30 April 2003 http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Leigh JM (1990) Oxygen therapy.

	\nAccording to the Health Commission of Hubei province, China, multiple pneumonia cases first appeared in Wuhan with unclear etiology in December 2019. Soon after, a novel type of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus disease 2019; previously 2019-nCoV) was isolated by Chinese authorities on 7 January 2020. It was reported that in most cases, patients were exposed to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, and transmission appeared to be from animals into human. No province in China has been exempt from the reach of the SARS-CoV-2, and 24 countries have reported cases of the infection until 1st February 2020. To make explicit the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients who were diagnosed with &quot;2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)&quot; in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, describing the clinical features of laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. (see Table 1 )\nThis retrospective study was approved by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University's ethical review board (Clinical Ethical Approval No.2020015). In total, the information of 84 patients who were diagnosed from December 2019 to January 2020 were collected and patients who did not undergo laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 or who were tested negative in the laboratory of Zhongnan Hospital were excluded in this research. Ultimately, 34 patients who tested positive to the SARS-CoV-2 at least once via laboratory were included in this study. Among these 34 patients, the earliest admission date was 21 December 2019 and the latest admission date was 28 January 2020. Patients were followed up to 29 January 2020, any missing data was recorded as unknown.\nDemographical, clinical, laboratory and imaging tests (including CT and X-ray) data as well as management, treatment, and prognosis for the included patients were acquired from their medical history. Data collected were sorted and summarized.\nThe mean age of those patients was approximately 56 years and the range of age is from 26 to 88 years old. There were 8 patients who were younger than 40 years of age and also 8 patients who were older than or equal to 70 years of age. We didn't obtain young patients in our cohort and further research are needed to verify whether children and juvenile are of less likely to be infected.\nThe number of female patients was 20, accounting for 58.8% of all these 34 patients. Most patients (64.7%) lived in the Wuchang district. Among the patients, 47.1% had underlying diseases including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive, pulmonary disease, malignancy, chronic liver disease, hyperuricemia and hypothyroidism. Two patients were known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.\nUp to 94.1% patients had fever on admission or during hospitalization. The highest recorded temperature during hospitalization was 38.61  C (+-0.81  C). Half of the patients had coughs, and nearly two thirds of patients had myalgia or fatigue. A small group of patients had symptoms of diarrhea and headache. It is worth noting that a fraction of patients did not present with fever. Their symptoms were mild and limited to coughing and fatigue. In addition, findings from the chest radiographs indicated that up to 79.4% patients were infiltrated bilaterally. Only 3 patients showed unilateral infiltrates in their chest radiographs. Surprisingly, one patient presented normally in chest radiographs and this patient only presented with fever and fatigue. These variations in presentations may lead to a missed diagnosis in the primary examination. Therefore, clinicians must be mindful of patients presenting with atypical symptoms since the appearance of pulmonary infiltrates may be delayed and the absence of pulmonary changes on initial imaging does not mean that pneumonia will not develop.\n17.6% patients presented with leucopenia, while 11.8% patients presented with leukocytosis, on admission. It is worth noting that up to half of the patients had lymphopenia and 73% showed hypoalbuminemia. Most patients had a reduction in hemoglobin (38.2%) and prolonged prothrombin time (50%). Sodium level of all the patients was within the normal range. Most patients (52.9%) had normal serum levels of procalcitonin. Interleukin-6 level was tested in only 9 patients, and all 9 patients showed an increased level of Interleukin-6. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) also increased in most cases (59.1%). Only one out of four patients who were tested, showed elevated brain natriuretic peptide. Among patients who had multiple laboratory confirmation tests, 2 patients changed from positive to negative, while 3 patients changed from negative to positive.\nOf the 34 patients, 8 (23.5%) were initially or subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and all of them were over 50 years-old. Over 90% of patients received antibiotic therapy, while only 26.5% used corticosteroid. Up to 94.1% patients received antiviral therapy other than lopinavir/ritonavir. Of these, 9 patients switched to lopinavir/ritonavir after a period of time. Patients who were not prescribed lopinavir/ritonavir and patients prior to being prescribed lopinavir/ritonavir tended to have worse manifestations on their chest radiographs (14 out of 16, 87.5%). The intervals between examinations were 4.5 days. Surprisingly, one patient who was prescribed lopinavir/ritonavir at a later date, and who was re-examined after using lopinavir/ritonavir for four days, showed improvements in his chest radiographs. Even he was worse according to the changes of CT before switching to lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. However, as other patients were not re-examined, more information relating to the effects of lopinavir/ritonavir therapy could not be determined and further investigation and evaluation are needed. As for procalcitonin, of the 11 patients who received re-examination, 4 showed an elevation of procalcitonin, while 3 patients showed the opposite. Only one patient out of the 34 patients was treated with home isolation. All other patients required hospitalization.\nIn summary, the range of age in these cohort is from 26 to 88 years old and the mean age is approximately 56 years old. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to present with lymphopenia, and increase of ESR and IL-6. Since there are patients with atypical symptoms and imaging of chest radiograph, more attention to atypical symptoms during the early stage of COVID-19 and repeated chest imaging examinations are called for.\nFunding\nThis research received no external funding.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n Yihui Huang: Conceptualization, Writing - original draft.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Many factors are related to the severity of the disease, which can help clinicians to judge the severity of the patient and evaluate the prognosis.\nSince the middle of December 2019, many cases of pneumonia with unknown cause have been found in some hospitals in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. At present, it has been confirmed as a new type of acute respiratory infectious disease caused by coronavirus infection. On February 12, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that the official classification of the new coronavirus is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the same day that the official name of the disease caused by the virus is coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). At 12:00 am on February 22, 2020, 77,041 confirmed cases (including 10,968 severe cases), 4148 suspected cases, and 2445 dead cases have been officially reported in China. Many cases spread all over the world, including the United States, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, and so on, which suggested that the COVID-19 poses significant threats to international health.\nAlthough most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis, COVID-19 can develop to severe illnesses including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, or even death. The successful treatment of severe and critical cases is the key to reduce the complication and mortality. Basic disease treatment, secondary infection prevention, and timely organ function support are needed for them. Therefore, it is very important to find the related factors of disease severity in clinical practice. However, as far as we know, there is no study on the characteristics and risk factors associated with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Therefore, in this study, we compared the clinical and computed tomography (CT) features of 58 ordinary COVID-19 cases and 25 severe/critical cases to explore the related factors of severe/critical patients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nOur institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and the requirement for informed consent was waived.\nStudy Population\nNinety patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Fifth Trial Version) of China in our hospitals from January 2020 to February 2020 in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) having an epidemiological history; (2) having one of the following etiological evidences:(a) real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive in throat swabs or lower respiratory tract, and (b) the virus gene sequencing of respiratory or blood samples was highly homologous with SARS-CoV-2; and (3) having underwent thin-section CT at least one time. The ordinary patients all had fever or other respiratory symptoms with CT manifestations of pneumonia. The severe/critical patients met any of the following condition: (1) respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or greater; (2) finger of oxygen saturation of 93% or less in a resting state; (3) arterial oxygen tension (Pao2)/inspiratory oxygen fraction (Fio2) of 300 mm Hg or less (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa); (4) respiratory failure occurred and mechanical ventilation required; (5) shock occurred; and (6) patients with other organ failure needed intensive care unit monitoring and treatment. The exclusion criteria were COVID-19 patients without abnormal manifestations on CT. Finally, 7 patients were excluded because of no abnormal manifestations on CT and 83 patients were included. The clinical parameters included age, sex, time from illness onset to hospital admission, comorbidities (systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), symptoms, clinical signs, and laboratory findings were collected and evaluated.\nCT Examinations and Imaging Evaluation\nAll scans were obtained using a 16-row multidetector scanner (Siemens Sensation 16, Erlangen, Germany) with the following parameters: 120 kVp, 150 mA, 1.5 mm collimation, 1.35:1 pitch, sharp kernel (B80f), reconstruction matrix of 512 x 512, slice thickness of 1.0 mm, and high spatial resolution algorithm. Two chest radiologists with 10 and 8 years of experience who were blinded to the clinical data evaluated the CT findings in consensus. For each of the 83 patients, the initial chest CT images were evaluated for the following characteristics based on the Fleischner Society Nomenclature recommendations and similar studies: ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, nodule, reticulation, interlobular septal thickening, crazy-paving pattern, linear opacities, subpleural curvilinear line, bronchial wall thickening, lymph node enlargement, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. The &quot;spider web sign&quot; was defined as a triangular or angular GGO in the subpleural lung with the internal interlobular septa thickened like a net; the adjacent pleura was pulled and formed a spider web-like shape in the corner. To quantify the extent of lesions, a thin-section CT score was assigned on the basis of all abnormal areas involved. Each lobe was assigned a score that was based on the following: score 0, 0% involvement; score 1, less than 5% involvement; score 2, 5% to 25% involvement; score 3, 26% to 49% involvement; score 4, 50% to 75% involvement; and score 5, greater than 75% involvement. There was a score of 0 to 5 for each lobe, with a total possible score of 0 to 25. The software of the Pulmonary Infection Assistant Diagnosis (V1.7.0.1, Dexin Medical Imaging Technology Co, Ltd, Xian City, Shaanxi Province, China) was applied to acquire the 3D visualization of CT-VRT by automatically segmenting the whole lung and pulmonary lesions, then further precise manual correction was made.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS statistical software (version 20.0, IBM) and MedCalc software (version 15.2.2, MedCalc Software). Categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and quantitative variables were described using mean (SD) or median (interquartile range) values. The chi2 test and Fisher exact test were used for categorical variables. Quantitative variables were tested for normality using Shapiro-Wilk tests. Normally distributed data were analyzed by independent sample t test; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the clinical value of CT scores in distinguishing the ordinary and severe/critical types, and find the corresponding cutoff value. For logistic regression analysis, quantitative variables were transformed into categorical variables according to their reference ranges or the cutoff values provided by ROC analysis. Then a univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the clinical and CT features associated with severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia cases. P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics and Clinical Manifestations\nThe most common symptoms in 83 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were fever, cough, expectoration, and myalgia. Less common symptoms were headache, dyspnea, abdominal pain/diarrhea, pharyngeal discomfort, and chest pain (Table 1).\nBaseline Characteristics Between Severe/Critical Group and Ordinary Group\nTwenty-five (30.1%) of them were severe/critical cases, and 58 (69.9%) of them were ordinary cases. Compared with the ordinary group, the severe/critical patients were significantly older (mean age, 53.7 years [SD, 12.3] vs 41.9 years [SD, 10.6]; P &lt; 0.001) and had more comorbidities of diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No difference was observed in the proportion of men and women between the 2 groups. The median time from illness onset to hospital admission in severe/critical patients (8 days [6-12]) was significantly longer than those of the ordinary patients (6 days [3-8.5]) (P = 0.006). Compared with the ordinary patients, severe/critical patients had higher body temperature and higher incidences of cough, expectoration, dyspnea, and chest pain (Table 1). No significant differences of heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial pressure were found between the 2 groups.\nLaboratory Parameters\nCompared with the ordinary patients, the severe/critical patients had increased neutrophil ratio, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin, whereas decreased lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte count (Table 2). White blood cell count and neutrophil count were numerically increased in severe/critical group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The oxyhemoglobin saturation of the severe/critical patients was significantly lower than that of the ordinary patients.\nLaboratory Findings Between Severe/Critical Group and Ordinary Group\nChest CT Findings\nThe common chest CT features of both groups included GGO (81/83, 97.6%), linear opacities (54/83, 65.1%), consolidation (53/83, 63.9%), interlobular septal thickening (52/83, 62.7%), and crazy-paving pattern (30/83, 36.1%) (Table 3). The occurrence rates of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, and bronchial wall thickening in severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients (Figs. 1, 2). Besides, severe/critical patients showed higher incidences of lymph node enlargement, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion than ordinary patients. The CT scores of the severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients (P &lt; 0.001). The number of lung lobes involvement for severe/critical group was significantly higher than that of the ordinary group. For ROC analysis, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of CT score was 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.94; P &lt; 0.001) for the ordinary and severe/critical patients discrimination. When the cutoff value of CT score was 7, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.0% and 82.8%, respectively.\nCT Features Between Severe/Critical Group and Ordinary Group\nChest CT of a 44-year-old man with ordinary COVID-19 pneumonia (CT score = 5). A, An axial CT image showed multiple small regions of subpleural GGO with superimposed interlobular and intralobular septal thickening. B, 3D visualization of CT-VRT showed the extent of GGO with scattered pattern.\nChest CT findings of severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia (CT score = 18), a 60-year-old man with dyspnea and pleural effusion. A, An axial CT image showed diffuse large regions of crazy-paving pattern (GGO with superimposed interlobular and intralobular septal thickening) with partial consolidation and bronchial wall thickening. B, 3D visualization of CT-VRT showed the diffuse extent of GGO and consolidation.\nFactors Associated With Severe/Critical COVID-19 Pneumonia\nTable 4 showed the results of univariate logistic regression analyses in relationship to severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical factors of age older than 50 years, comorbidities, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, expectoration, decreased lymphocytes, and increased inflammation indicators were risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Computed tomography findings of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, bronchial wall thickening, high CT scores (&gt;7), and extrapulmonary lesions were imaging features of severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia.\nUnivariate Logistic Analysis of Clinical and CT Features for Severe/Critical COVID-19 Pneumonia\nDISCUSSION\nCompared with the ordinary patients, the severe/critical patients have poor prognosis and high mortality. Studying the clinical and imaging characteristics of them is helpful to deepen our understanding of the mechanism of severe/critical conditions and promote its clinical diagnosis and treatment. The objective of this study was to identify clinical and CT features associated with severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia by comparing severe/critical patients with ordinary patients.\nIn this study, we found that the severe/critical patients were older and had more underlying diseases than the ordinary cases. The people with higher age or poor state of health suffer from serious diseases, which may be the result of their weakened immune function. There was no difference in the ratio of men and women between the 2 groups, indicating that sex was not a risk factor for disease severity. Compared with the ordinary group, the severe/critical group had higher incidences of chest pain and dyspnea. Chest pain may result from the inflammatory affection of the pleura. Dyspnea is related to the severe damage to alveoli in the severe/critical group. The high body temperature may indicate that the immune system of severe/critical patients was highly activated. The occurrence of these symptoms could help clinicians identify the disease severity in clinical practice.\nIn our study, there were multiple laboratory indicator differences between the ordinary and severe/critical group. The decrease of lymphocytes in the severe/critical patients indicates that a large number of immune cells are consumed and the immune function is inhibited. Damage to lymphocytes may be critical in the exacerbations of patients, and the decreased lymphocytes could be used as an important index in the evaluation of disease severity. The increased values of neutrophil ratio, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin in severe/critical group may be related to cytokine storm induced by virus invasion and comorbid with other kinds of infections, which was supported by the recent studies. Timely prevention of infection may help reduce complication and mortality.\nChest CT can accurately evaluate the type and extent of lung lesions. In this study, we found that the most common CT findings were GGO, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and &quot;spider web sign&quot; for both groups of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared with ordinary groups, consolidation was significantly more frequent in severe/critical patients, which indicates that the alveoli are completely filled by inflammatory exudation. This usually means that the virus diffuses into the respiratory epithelium, leading to necrotizing bronchitis and diffuse alveolar damage. Severe/critical patients showed more lymph node enlargement, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion. These extrapulmonary lesions may indicate the occurrence of severe inflammation. Although GGO is the most common CT feature of COVID-19 pneumonia, no statistical incidence difference was observed between our 2 groups. The CT scores of the severe/critical group were significantly higher than those of the ordinary group. It can accurately distinguish the severe/critical patients from the ordinary patients (AUC = 0.87), which is helpful for the judgment of clinical condition and has important clinical value. To sum up, CT can evaluate the severity of the disease, which is of great significance for the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia.\nThis study has several limitations. First, the data of the 2 groups were not balanced, and the sample size of the severe/critical group was relatively small. Further studies with more patients, especially severe/critical patients, are warranted. Second, because most patients remain in the hospital at the time of submission, it is difficult to assess the risk factors for poor outcomes. Finally, none of the patients had a lung biopsy or autopsy to reflect the histopathological changes.\nIn conclusion, in this study, we found that the clinical factors of age older than 50 years, comorbidities, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, expectoration, decreased lymphocytes, and increased inflammation indicators may be risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Computed tomography findings of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, bronchial wall thickening, high CT scores, and extrapulmonary lesions may be features of severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Computed tomography plays an important role in the diagnosis and disease severity evaluation of this disease.\nSupplementary Material\nKunhua Li and Jiong Wu contributed equally to this work.\nConflicts of interest and sources of funding: none declared.\nREFERENCES\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses - a statement of the coronavirus study group\nWorld experts and funders set priorities for COVID-19 research\nNovel coronavirus in China\nEpidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study\nCT imaging features of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\nDiagnosis and treatment protocols of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (trial version 5)\nFleischner Society: glossary of terms for thoracic imaging\nSpectrum of clinical and radiographic findings in patients with diagnosis of H1N1 and correlation with clinical severity\nPulmonary sequelae in convalescent patients after severe acute respiratory syndrome: evaluation with thin-section CT\nA novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern\nChest CT findings in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19): relationship to duration of infection\nClinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China\nPathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome\nRadiographic and CT features of viral pneumonia\nImaging of pulmonary viral pneumonia\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30154-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on

were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Institut Pasteur.

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls.\n\n We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L) or lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L).\n\n\nFindings\nNormal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L), lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L), eosinopenia (&lt;0·02 109/L), and elevated hs-CRP (?4 mg/L) were presented in 95·0%, 52·2%, 74·7% and 86·7% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87·2%, 28·8%, 31·3% and 45·2% of the controls, respectively.\n\n The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74·7% and specificity of 68·7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0·717.

a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

The medical records were reviewed for age, underlying diseases, vital signs on admission, initial chest radiographic findings, and clinical outcomes.\n\n According to chest radiographic findings, patients were classified into 4 groups, as follows: [1] normal (n = 46), [2] hilar and/or peribronchial markings alone (n = 64), [3] consolidation (n = 64), and [4] other findings (n = 29).\n\n Factors associated with clinical outcomes were analyzed using logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nTwo hundreds and three patients (median 6.8 years) were enrolled in this study.\n\n Fifteen percent (31/203) of patients were admitted to PICU.\n\n Among 31 patients, 39% (12/31) of patients required mechanical ventilation (MV).\n\n When the initial chest radiographic findings were compared between patients with consolidation (n = 64) and those without consolidation (n = 139), a higher percentage of patients with consolidation were admitted to PICU (29.7% vs.\n\n8.6%, P &lt;

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT).

In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21 patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the second CT after 3-4 days.\nConclusion\nSARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based on the patient's history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and laboratory tests. Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Multiple patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia.\nIntroduction\nIn December 2019, a series of pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) break out in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Since then, the COVID-19 confirmed cases are increasing rapidly. As of February 10, 2020, a total of 40,265 confirmed cases have been reported in China, with another 23,589 suspected cases, 909 fatal cases, and 3501 discharged patients. Moreover, more than 300 similar cases have been identified in other 24 countries. On December 30, 2019, WHO announced the event constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), indicating that a big threat to global health has been posed by the novel coronavirus infections.\nSARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. Up to date, six coronavirus species have been identified to infect humans and cause disease. Among them, 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 infections are frequently mild, mostly caused common cold symptoms. The other two species, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), might cause fatal illness. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the coronaviruses that infects humans. Infected patients predominantly presented with fever, cough, and radiological ground glass lung opacities, which resemble SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.\nA recent publication reported a familial cluster of pneumonia linked to SARS-CoV-2, which indicated the human transmission of the disease. In this family, a 10-year-old child had ground glass lung opacification, but no clinical symptoms. The patient was confirmed to be affected by this novel coronavirus by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These findings indicate that some patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic. If some people have a clear history of exposure, regardless of clinical symptoms, or if they present suggestive clinical manifestations, regardless of history of exposure, it is necessary to confirm whether they are infected by chest CT or SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests.\nChest CT plays an important role in timely detecting lung abnormalities, allowing for early treatment. We aimed at describing clinical and CT imaging characteristics of 90 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and early follow-up appearances of 52 patients. We hope our findings will provide useful information for medical imagers to recognize the COVID-19 pneumonia and assess its evolution.\nMaterials and methods\nPatients\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Our institutional review board waived written informed consent for this retrospective study that evaluated de-identified data involving no potential risk to patients and no link between the patients and the researchers. All patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time PCR were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4, 2020. The clinical data analyzed were as follows: age, sex, exposure history, comorbid conditions, symptoms, and laboratory results.\nImage acquisition and analysis\nA 49-year-old man with history of recent travel to Wuhan presented with fever and cough for 6 days. a, b Non-contrast enhanced chest CT showed multiple peripheral patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental with obscure boundary (white arrows), as well as thickening of the adjacent pleura (black arrows). Besides, CT scan also demonstrated consolidation in the right lower lobe and air bronchogram sign in the lesion (red arrow)\nA 49-year-old woman with history of recent travel to Wuhan, presented with fever and cough for 8 days. a Non-contrast enhanced chest CT demonstrated multiple ground glass opacification in the both lower lobes (white arrows). b After 4 days, the follow-up CT scan showed enlarged lesions and increased density of the lesions compared with previous images, indicating disease progression (red arrows)\nA 62-year-old man with a history of exposure to a market in Guangzhou, presented with fever and cough for 11 days. a, b Non-contrast enhanced chest CT showed multiple ground glass opacification in the both lower lobes and thickening of the adjacent pleura. The interlobular septal thickening in regions of ground glass opacification, representing crazy paving pattern (red arrows)\nAll included patients underwent baseline chest non-contrast enhanced CT in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital). An Optima CT680 scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) was used and set at 210 mA and 120 kV, with the minimum slice thickness of 1 mm. All images were analyzed by two senior chest radiologists with 15-20 years of experience, in a consistent manner. Image analysis, focused on the lesion features of each patient, included (a) distribution characteristics, (b) number of lobes involved, (c) lobe of lesion distribution, (d) patterns of the lesion (e.g., ground glass opacification, consolidation, cavitation, crazy paving pattern), (e) other signs in the lesion (e.g., interlobular septal thickening, air bronchogram sign), and (f) other findings (e.g., adjacent pleura thickening, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, thoracic lymphadenopathy, pulmonary emphysema). Thoracic lymphadenopathy was defined as lymph node size of &gt;= 10 mm in short-axis; ground glass opacification was defined as hazy opacity that did not obscure underlying bronchial and vascular margins (Figs. 1 and 2); consolidation was defined as opacification with obscuration of bronchial structures and pulmonary vessels; crazy paving pattern was defined as ground glass opacification with associated interlobular septal thickening  (Fig. 3). The alterations caused by underlying lung diseases (such as tuberculosis, lung cancer) were not included in this study.\nFifty-two patients underwent a second chest CT after 1-6 days (mean 3.5 days). These images were evaluated for lesions' evolution by two senior radiologists, in a consistent manner. Changes in lung lesions were divided as no change, disease resolution, and disease progression.\nResults\nPatient characteristics and laboratory results\n	Patients (n = 90)	 	Patient demographics	 	  Median age, years (range)	50 (18-86)	 	  Men	39 (43%)	 	  Women	51 (57%)	 	Exposure history	 	  Exposure to Wuhan or infected patient	86 (96%)	 	  Unknown exposure	4 (4%)	 	Comorbid conditions	 	  Any	45 (50%)	 	  Hypertension	17 (19%)	 	  Diabetes	5 (6%)	 	  Cardiovascular disease	3 (3%)	 	  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	1 (1%)	 	  Tuberculosis	2 (2%)	 	  Malignancy	2 (2%)	 	  Others	15 (17%)	 	Signs and symptoms	 	  Fever	70 (78%)	 	  Cough	57 (63%)	 	  Sputum production	11 (12%)	 	  Fatigue weakness	19 (21%)	 	  Myalgia	25 (28%)	 	  Sore throat	23 (26%)	 	  Chills	6 (7%)	 	  Headache	4 (4%)	 	  Diarrhea	5 (6%)	 	  Nausea	5 (6%)	 	  Vomit	2 (2%)	 	  No obvious symptoms	6 (7%)	 	Laboratory test	 	  C-reactive protein (mg/L; normal range 0-10)		 	    Increased	38 (42%)	 	    Decreased    Normal	0 (0%)52 (58%)	 	  Leucocytes (x109/L, normal range 3.5-9.5)	 	    Increased	3 (3%)	 	    Decreased	19 (21%)	 	    Normal	68 (76%)	 	  Positive for (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test by	 	  Real-time PCR	90 (100%)	 	\nThis study included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age range, 18-86 years). Table 1 summarizes patients' clinical characteristics. Most patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients; exposure history was unknown in 4 (4%) patients. The majority of patients presented with fever and cough. Six (7%) patients were asymptomatic. Half of the patients hold comorbidities. Thirty-eight (42%) patients showed elevated C-reactive protein. Patients with decreased white blood cells were more than those with increased white blood cells.\nImaging findings of patients with SARS-CoV-2 at presentation\n	Patients (n = 90)	 	Distribution	 	  Periphery distribution	46 (51%)	 	  Bilateral involvement	53 (59%)	 	  Multifocal involvement	62 (69%)	 	  Unifocal involvement	7 (8%)	 	Number of lobes involved	 	  0	21 (23%)	 	  1	12 (13%)	 	  2	4 (4%)	 	  3	13 (14%)	 	  4	8 (9%)	 	  5	32 (36%)	 	  More than two lobes involved	53 (59%)	 	Lobe of lesion distribution	 	  Left upper lobe	48 (53%)	 	  Left lower lobe	55 (61%)	 	  Right upper lobe	48 (53%)	 	  Right middle lobe	40 (44%)	 	  Right lower lobe	59 (66%)	 	  Bilateral upper lobes	40 (44%)	 	  Bilateral lower lobes	47 (52%)	 	Patterns of the lesion	 	  Ground glass opacification	65 (72%)	 	  Consolidation	12 (13%)	 	  Crazy paving pattern	11 (12%)	 	  Cavitation	0 (0%)	 	Other signs in the lesion	 	  Interlobular septal thickening	33 (37%)	 	  Linear opacities combined	55 (61%)	 	  Air bronchogram sign	7 (8%)	 	Other findings	 	  Adjacent pleura thickening	50 (56%)	 	  Pleural effusion	4 (4%)	 	  Pericardial effusion	1 (1%)	 	  Lymphadenopathy	1 (1%)	 	  Pulmonary emphysema	0 (0%)	 	\nBaseline chest CT showed abnormalities in 69 patients, and 53 (59%) patients had more than two lobes involved. More than half of the patients presented bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution. Lesions were inclined to distribute in the lower lobes. Of the 90 patients included, 65 (72%) had ground glass opacification, 12 (13%) had consolidation, and 11 (12%) patients presented with crazy paving pattern. Thirty-three (37%) patients had interlobular thickening, 55 (61%) had combined linear opacities, 7 (8%) showed air bronchogram sign, and 50 (56%) presented adjacent pleura thickening. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, cavitation, thoracic lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary emphysema were uncommon imaging findings in these patients (Table 2).\nImage change on repeat chest CT in 52 patients\n	Patients (n = 52)	 	No change	10 (19%)	 	Disease resolution	4 (8%)	 	Disease progression	38 (73%)	 	\nFifty-two patients repeated a chest CT examination after 1-6 days. Among them, 10 patients (19%) had no changes, 4 patients (8%) had disease resolution, and 38 patients (73%) had disease progression (Table 3). In 3 patients (6%) with baseline negative scan, follow-up CT after 3-4 days showed bilateral ground glass opacities.\nDiscussion\nConsidering that the majority of patients had a clear history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients, our data confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 has the ability for person-to-person transmission.\nInfected patients predominantly presented with fever and cough. Notably, some patients (7%) were asymptomatic. These findings indicated that the absence of clinical symptoms cannot rule out the diagnosis of infection. Persons with a clear history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, regardless of clinical symptoms, should be considered for medical observation, home isolation, and further examination. Similarly, patients with symptoms without a known history of exposure should undergo further examinations.\nThe numbers of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly increasing nationwide in China. Chest CT can detect lung abnormalities with high sensitivity, which is quite helpful for early diagnosis of the disease that can trigger early treatment, which facilitates the containment of this emergency disease.\nOur study showed some common CT imaging features in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: bilateral, multifocal ground glass opacities, with peripheral distribution. Of note, more than half of the patients had multilobar involvement and lesions were more frequent in the lower lobes. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, cavitation, thoracic lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary emphysema were uncommon imaging findings in these patients.\nImaging features of viruses' infections usually appear as multifocal ground glass opacities. A previous study identified that ground glass opacities on CT images correspond to pathological diffuse alveolar damage. Histologically, the opacity of ground glass may be caused by alveoli filled with blood, pus, water, or cells. The CT imaging features of viral pneumonia are associated with the pathogenesis of viral infection. Most viral pneumonia shares similar imaging features in the same Viridae family because of similarities in the pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family Coronaviridae, so, as expected, the imaging features of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. Nonetheless, unilateral involvement is more common than multifocal involvement in the early phase of SARS and MERS. In our study, the majority of patients showed multifocal involvement in the initial chest CT scan, and this finding is consistent with a recent report. However, whether this finding is a characteristic feature of the SARS-CoV-2 distinguished from the other two coronaviruses remains to be confirmed by further studies.\nThe follow-up CT examination in 52 patients showed that 3 patients who had negative baseline scan, rapidly progressed to with bilateral ground glass opacities. Since there is an incubation period after infection with the SARS-CoV-2, a patient may not present any symptoms and imaging abnormalities during this period. At present, real-time PCR is used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection from respiratory secretions.\nIn our study, few patients initially negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test had bilateral ground glass opacities in chest CT scans. After a few days, patients converted to positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test by real-time PCR. This points out that patient's history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and laboratory tests are all important elements in the diagnosis of the disease.\nOur study had some limitations. First of all, we cannot demonstrate any prognostic role for chest CT, because we did not find any correlation between imaging and the course of the disease. Also, 52 patients with short-term follow-up chest CT showed disease progression. The imaging evaluation of disease progression is not complete, and we will collect more follow-up CT data to observe the evolution and outcome of the disease and provide more imaging information to be correlated with clinical findings.\nConclusion\nChest CT detects minor lung lesions in patients at an early stage of disease, demonstrating its utility in guiding the diagnosis. In a patient with a history of close contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient, early manifestation of bilateral, multifocal, and peripheral ground glass opacities on a chest CT scan might be a sign of a 2019 novel coronavirus infection. Thus, chest CT is suggested as an important tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.\nThis article is part of the Topical Collection on Infection and inflammation\nPublisher's note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nXi Xu and Chengcheng Yu contributed equally to this work.\nAuthors' contributions\nJL, XT, and LL designed the study; XX was a major contributor in writing the manuscript; CY and JQ collected the imaging and clinical data; LZ, SJ, DH, BC, ZZ, WG, ZL, RJ, TH, YD, LLin, and QG revised it critically for important intellectual content.

binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak.\n Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different

MERS-CoV spike protein and form a species barrier to infection.\n To better understand the species adaptability of MERS-CoV, we identified a suboptimal species-derived variant of DPP4 to study viral adaption.\n Passaging virus on cells expressing this DPP4 variant led to accumulation of mutations in the viral spike which increased replication.\n Parallel passages revealed distinct paths of viral adaptation to the same DPP4 variant.\n Structural analysis and functional assays showed that these mutations enhanced viral entry with suboptimal DPP4 by altering the surface charge of spike.\n These

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21.

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Funding: We did not receive any fundings.\nIntroduction\nThe recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to a major concern of the potential for not only an epidemic but a pandemic. Although most of the cases are still occurring in Hubei province, China, there are some other epicenters developing in China. COVID-19 appears to be highly contagious. It is classified as a type of RNA virus, belonging to the family of coronaviruses, which primarily leads to a respiratory system infection. One of the primary findings for COVID-19 is pneumonia. Although the exact origin of COVID-19 remains unknown, the first reported cases were all linked to the Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market where wild animals (such as bats) were sold illegally. Evidence has also been found that it can be transmitted from human to human through respiratory droplets, contact and even via fecal-oral transmission. \nAlthough control measures have been applied to prevent further spread in China, including isolation of people suspected to have the disease, the need for better diagnosis and treatment of patients with pneumonia is no longer limited to Wuhan, especially with the huge turnover during the spring festival period. The infection of COVID-19 is spreading fast with increasing numbers of infected patients nationwide and worldwide.\nWenzhou is a city located in Zhejiang province with a population of 9.25 million. Wenzhou people are usually merchants by profession and frequently travel from city to city or work and live in other cities for business purposes. Currently, approximately 180,000 Wenzhou residents live in Wuhan and 33,000 Wenzhou people have been detected returning from Wuhan and its surrounding areas according to the Wenzhou city government new released on Jan 29, 2020. As consequence, Wenzhou is reported as the city with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside Hubei province in China. By Feb 15th 2020, according to the government announcement, there are 66,580 confirmed cases reported in China, 1162 cases reported from Zhejiang province and 499 cases reported from Wenzhou city. \nSerious cases of COVID-19 can develop severe pneumonia, ARDS and multiple organ failures leading to death, while non severe cases present ordinary symptoms of respiratory system infection. The mortality and rate of severe cases up to Feb 15th 2020 in Hubei province and Wenzhou city were 2.6% vs 0% (1457/54,406 vs 0/499) and 15.2% vs 5.2% (8276/54,406 vs 26/499), showing a significant regional difference. However, little is known about COVID-19 outside Wuhan, although Chang et al. reported 13 cases in Beijing and Guan et al. reported 1099 cases in all of China. In Guan et al's study, the statistical analysis was done at the level of the whole cohort, no regional analysis was performed.\nFurthermore, from the point of view of etiology, the virulence of a pathogen can sometimes sharply increase during the host shift,   in the case of COVID-19 from possible wild animals sold in the seafood market to humans. In contrast, virulence will decrease through long term host-parasite interactions. But it should be mentioned that virulence is often an indirect effect of the pathogen, such as an inappropriate immune response). And also the prognosis of the patients depends on a wide range of factors. Even so, we still sought to analyze the difference of clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations between the patients of Wenzhou city with or without Hubei residence travel history, that is, between different generations of patients transmitting the virus.\nHence, the aim of this case series was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to hospitals in Wenzhou, and analyze the difference between patients with or without Hubei province residence/travel history.\nMethods\nStudy participants and design\nThis retrospective multi-center cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating site. The written informed consent was waived. The patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17th to February 10th, 2020 in three tertiary hospitals of Wenzhou city, including the Wenzhou central hospital in the urban area, and two county level hospitals, specifically Ruian people's hospital and Yueqing people's hospital. All the patients were hospitalized and had laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection. The clinical outcomes were monitored up to Feb 15th, 2020, the final date of follow-up.\nData collection\nAll the clinical data on epidemiology (including recent exposure history), signs and symptoms, underlying comorbidities and laboratory results were retrospectively extracted from electronic medical records and checked by both on-site and off-site doctors. The real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test was performed using nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens or induced sputum at Wenzhou municipal Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC). The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptom was noticed.\nPneumonia was diagnosed based on the IDSA/ATS guidelines. In brief, patients with at least one of the clinical symptoms of cough, sputum, fever, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain, plus at least one finding of coarse crackles on auscultation or elevated inflammatory biomarkers, in addition to a new pulmonary infiltration on chest CT, were diagnosed as having pneumonia. The worldwide accepted pneumonia severity scoring systems, including Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and the CURB-65, were used to assess pneumonia severity.\nImaging analysis and quantification\nAll patients underwent chest CT examinations. Images were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 1-1.5 mm using a lung kernel as part of the reconstruction process. All imaging features were reviewed and evaluated by two experienced radiologists (7, 17 years of experience in thoracic CT). Decisions were reached by consensus. The CT features including ground glass opacity (GGO) and mixed GGO, consolidation were evaluated. Lesion size was described as grade 1 (diameter, &lt;1 cm), grade 2 (diameter, 1-3 cm), grade 3 (diameter, 3 cm to 50% of the segment), or grade 4 (over 50% of the segment) according to the previously described methods. Each segment was reviewed and scored. Then a total pulmonary infiltration score was calculated, that is to say, the sum of scores of all the 18 pulmonary segments was used. The number of affected lung lobes and segments were also counted. The location of the lesion was considered as peripheral if it was in the outer one-third of the lung; otherwise, it was considered as central. Other radiological patterns were also evaluated.\nStatistical analysis\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to evaluate distribution type. Normally distributed data were expressed as mean +- standard deviation. Non-normally distributed data and ordinal data were expressed as median (inter-quartile range). Independent sample t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the differences of clinical and radiological data between patients with different exposure history. The Friedman test was used to compare scores of various segments of left and right lobe, with the post hoc analysis done using the Dunn-Bonferroni test. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\nResults\nDemographics, baseline characteristics of overall 149 patients.\nTable 1	 	\nGeneral data	Overall (N = 149)	 	Age	45.11 +- 13.35	 	Sex	Male/Female(81/68)	 	Height (cm)	167 (11.75)	 	Weight (kg)	65.92 (18.75)	 	BMI	23.75 (4.54)	 	Exposure history		 	 Stay in Wuhan	80(53.69%)	 	 stay in Hubei Province except Wuhan	5(3.36%)	 	 Contact with people from Hubei Province	49(32.89%)	 	 No relation with Hubei Province	15(10.06%)	 	Chronic disease		 	 cardio-cerebrovascular disease	28(18.79%)	 	 digestive system diseases	8 (5.37%)	 	 endocrine diseases	9(6.04%)	 	 malignant tumor	2(1.34%)	 	 neural system diseases	0(0%)	 	 respiratory system diseases	1(0.67%)	 	 others	4(2.68%)	 	Temperature ( C)	37.86+-0.87	 	pH	7.11 (0.04)	 	 increased	 21 (14.09%)	 	 decreased	 4 (2.68%)	 	PaO2 (kpa, range80-100)	96.05 (25.58)	 	 decreased	 23 (15.44%), 56.25 +- 6.58	 	SaO% (range&gt;=95%)	97.43% (2%)	 	 decreased	 14 (9.4%)	 	Heart rate (beats per minute)	88.63 +- 14.27	 	Systolic pressure (mmHg)	129.98 +- 15.44	 	Diastolic pressure (mmHg)	81.69 +- 10.16	 	\nBMI: body mass index; PH: hydrogen ion concentration.\nA total of 149 patients, including 40 patients from Wenzhou central hospital, 64 patients from Ruian people's hospital and 45 patients from Yueqing people's hospital were recruited.

The median interval between symptom onset and hospitalization was 6.8 (5.0) days. On admission, fever (114/149, 76.5%), cough (87/149, 58.4%) and expectoration (48/149, 32.2%) were the most common symptoms, whereas vomiting (2/149 1.3%) and dyspnea (2/149 1.3%) were rare. A total of 14(9.4%) patients had decreased oxygen saturation. On admission, 33 (24.2%) and 53 (35.6%) patients had leukopenia and lymphopenia, respectively. Platelets were below the normal range in 20 (13.4%) patients. Overall, 82 (55.0%) patients demonstrated elevated levels of C-reactive protein while elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase and D-dimer were less common (Table 3 ).\nNo complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory system injury, acute kidney injury or septic shock occurred in our cohort. Concerning the pneumonia severity score, for Curb-65, 134 patients had a zero score, 15 patients had a score of 1. For PSI, 82 patients were graded class I, 54 patients class II, 10 patients class III, 3 patients class IV, and no patients were graded with class V. All these scoring measures reflected the mild severity of our patients. Most of our patients had oxygen therapy (134/149,89.93%), antiviral treatment (140/149,93.96%) and interferon administration (144/149,96.64%). Two patients used noninvasive mechanical ventilation, none of our patients used invasive mechanical ventilator, ECMO, or were sent to the ICU. Up until Feb 15th 2020, 76 patients remained in the hospital, 73 were discharged and no patient died.\nRadiological data of all patients.\nTable 4	 	\nOnset-CT interval (day)	7.61 (7)	 	Lobes involved	3 (4)	 	Segments involved	6 (10.5)	 	Pulmonary infiltration (segment level)	N = 132x18=2376	 	Density		 	GGO/mixed/consolidation	287/637/170 (12.08%/26.81%/7.15%)	 	Location		 	Peripheral/central/both	853/51/193 (35.9%/2.15%/8.12%)	 	Form		 	Patchy/oval	935/157 (39.35%/6.6%)	 	Radiological score	12.5 (24.5)	 	Other Radiological pattern	N = 144	 	Air bronchogram	N/Y(68/81)	 	Centrilobular nodules	N/Y(146/3)	 	tree-in-bud	N/Y(148/1)	 	Reticular pattern	N/Y(70/79)	 	Subpleural linear opacity	N/Y(118/31)	 	Bronchial dilatation	N/Y(123/26)	 	Cystic change	N/Y(137/12)	 	lymphadenopathy	N/Y(142/7)	 	Pleural effusion	N/Y(139/10)	 	\nN: without manifestation; Y: with manifestation.\nThe radiological data on admission is summarized in Table 4 . The median interval between symptom onset and CT examination was 7.61 (7) days. On admission, by median, each patient had 3 (4) involved pulmonary lobes and 6 (10.5) involved segments. Segment 6 and 10 were the most involved (p &lt; 0.001). A total of 287 (12.1%) segments presented GGO, 637 (26.8%) segments presented mixed opacity and 170 (7.2%) segments presented consolidation. The lesions were more localized in the periphery rather than the center of the lung (853,35.9% vs 51, 2.15%). There were more patchy lesions than oval lesions (935,39.35% vs 157, 6.6%). Other imaging patterns such as centrilobular nodules, tree-in-bud sign, cystic change, lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were rare.\nComparison between patients with different exposure history was also performed. No significant difference of demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory test or imaging manifestations was found between these two groups (all p &gt; 0.05) (Supplementary Tables 1-4).\nInterestingly, 17 out of 149 (11.4%) of our patients had normal chest CT findings on admission. Among these 17 patients, chest CT of 12 patients kept being negative, with the latest follow-up CT 10.3 days later. In contrast, the chest CT of the other 5 patients became positive over an average of 7 days. The symptoms of these 12 patients included fever (8 patients), cough (3 patients), expectoration (1 patient), headache (1 patient), sore throat (2 patients), snotty (1 patient), diarrhea (1 patient). Two patients presented leukopenia, 1 patient presented lymphopenia.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this report is the largest multi-center case series data of hospitalized patients from one city with COVID-19. By February 10th 2020, 149 patients were recruited from 3 tertiary hospitals in Wenzhou, which is the city with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside Hubei province in China.\nThe main findings for this cohort is that patients had milder infection, especially relative to published data from Wuhan.       In our study, the signs, symptoms and laboratory test characteristics of COVID-19 were generally consistent with these previous publications. But none of our patients was sent to the ICU or had shock, while only two had used non-invasive mechanical ventilation. In contrast, the rate of ICU, shock and mechanical ventilation of studies from Wuhan is much higher, being 23-31.7%, 4-16.7% and 17-46.3%, respectively.       The announced mortality (2.6% vs 0%) and rate of severe cases (15.2% vs 5.2%) of Hubei vs. Wenzhou remains much higher showing a significant regional difference. Our results appear to be similar to those 13 patients from Beijing where all of them recovered.\nThe potential explanation of this difference is the lack of medical care resources in Hubei during the outbreak. Hospitals in Wuhan tend to hospitalize severe patients, resulting in the high rate of severe cases and mortality in the publications. According to the statistical paper by Zhou et al., the most conservative estimate of 54,000 infections in Wuhan, and the current 8000 plus beds available in the local hospitals don't have enough space for patients with milder infections. Therefore, we presume in a region such as Wenzhou, where there are enough medical facilities and not so many patients that they can provide early medical care to all affected patients, therefore, making it appear that the prognosis of COVID-19 is improved.\nAnother concern from the point of view of etiology, for a pandemic disease, in general, pathogens tend to reduce their virulence in order to maximize their between-host transmission, and hosts have been selected to reduce the harm caused by their pathogen, otherwise the lack of adaptation in novel host-pathogen associations may suspend the transmission seen in some emerging diseases. Albeit, no significant difference of demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory test or imaging manifestations has been found between patients with or without Hubei travel or resident history (all p &gt; 0.05), although the severity of our cohort is less than that of Wuhan. Further comparison studies could be carried out between patients with a long- term time gap of disease onset in the same geographic location.\nOur study provided a meticulous evaluation of pulmonary infiltration of COVID-19 on CT. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral GGO, mixed GGO or consolidation with predominance in the lower lung (S6,10), with more extensive mixed opacity than GGO and consolidation is highly suspicious of 2019-nCoV infection when considering an interval between symptom onset and CT examination of 7.61 (7) days. The description of imaging features has been limited in the clinical literature. Our findings are compatible with other small sample size (51 and 21 cases) radiological publications.   Since the form of lesion could be oval sometimes instead of patchy, physicians and radiologists should keep in mind the diversity of imaging presentations of COVID-19. Human coronaviruses are considered as important pathogens that cause respiratory infection. There were two other previous coronavirus outbreaks, including (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. All these three coronavirus infections have similar common radiographic manifestations at presentation, including unilateral or bilateral GGO or consolidation, while COVID-19 shows more extensive GGO than consolidation, which is consistent with the clinical scenario. \nAll reported patients in Wuhan showed pulmonary infiltration in chest computed tomography (CT).     However, Guan et al. reported 230 out of 1099 (20.1%) cases and Chuang et al. reported 3 out of 21 (14.3%) having normal CT scans for patients diagnosed with symptoms plus RT-PCR positive findings. In our study, 17 out of 149 (11.4%) of our patients had normal chest CT on admission and 12 remained negative 10 days later. This finding suggests that a normal chest CT scan cannot exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19. Therefore, clinicians et radiologists should still suspect patients with typical symptoms, such as fever, cough, lymphopenia, and exposure history, and give them an RT-PCR test.\nAs far as treating patients is concerned, antiviral treatment has been used for COVID-19.       Nevertheless, until now, no specific treatment has been recommended except for supportive care. Randomized controlled trial are being rapidly initiated to assess the efficacy and safety of antiviral drugs.\nThis study has several limitations. First, the incubation period, which is the time between the infection and symptom onset, was not analyzed in our study, since the time of infection cannot be determined for the patients with resident history in Hubei. Second, it is reported that some patients with positive chest CT findings may have negative RT-PCR results. In that case, it is suggested that the RT-PCR tests be repeated especially for the patients with high clinical suspicion of COVID-19. Hence, only the positive cases confirmed by the CDC were included in our study. The pre-transfer data was not available. Third, a part of our patients still remain in the hospital, so technically the final clinic outcome is not complete.\nChest CT of a male patient, 37 years old. This individual came back from Wuhan to Wenzhou on January 19th. He presented with cough and expectoration. He underwent a chest CT examination on January 24th, which showed subtle peripheral ground glass opacity in the middle lobe, and right inferior lobe. He was hospitalized on the same day. The RT-PCR test was done and was found to be positive. The CT images of January 27th and February 2nd showed a significant increase of lesion number and density, especially in the both lower lobes. Two RT-PCR tests were performed on February 4th and 7th and both results were negative. The CT images of February 7th showed a decrease in density of the pulmonary lesions. On the CT examination of February 15th, the lesions were absorbed and the patient was discharged. During the hospitalization, the patient had arbidol as antiviral treatment and nasal spray of interferon, no oxygen therapy was performed since the oxygen saturation of the patient remained normal. The patient had no fever during the entire disease course.\nFig. 1\nIn conclusion, most patients from Wenzhou city, Zhejiang province presented mild infection in our study. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral GGO, mixed GGO or consolidation with predominance in the lower lung, more extensive mixed opacity than GGO and consolidation is highly suspicious of COVID-19 infection during the outbreak in the first week of disease onset. Some patients with COVID-19 can present with normal chest findings, suggesting that a normal chest CT scan cannot exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19 (Fig. 1 ).\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors of this study declare that they each have no conflict of interest.\nReferences\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 [published online ahead of print, 2020 Jan 24]\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China [published online ahead of print, 2020 Jan 24]\nEarly transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia [published online ahead of print, 2020 Jan 29]\nN.

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Institut Pasteur.

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21.

city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.
