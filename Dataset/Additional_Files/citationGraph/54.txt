SARS-CoV-2 detection among residents (226, 13.4%) was significantly higher than among staff members (87, 8.7%) (P &lt; 0.001). Of the 226 infected residents, 37 (16.4%) were detected on a case-by-case basis due to their COVID-19 symptoms and 189 (83.6%) were detected through mass screening. Most (77.0%) had possible COVID-19 symptoms, including respiratory symptoms and signs (44.5%) and fever (46.5%); 23.0% were asymptomatic. A total of 116 (51.4%) patients received a course of oral hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (HCQ-AZM) for &gt;= 3 days; 47 (20.8%) died. Through multivariate analysis, the death rate was positively associated with being male (30.7% vs. 14.0%, OR = 3.95, P = 0.002), aged &gt; 85 years (26.1% vs. 15.6%, OR = 2.43, P = 0.041) and receiving oxygen therapy (39.0% vs. 12.9%, OR = 5.16, P &lt; 0.001) and negatively associated with being diagnosed through mass screening (16.9% vs. 40.5%, OR = 0.20, P= 0.001) and receiving HCQ-AZM treatment &gt;= 3 days (15.5% vs. 26.4%, OR = 0.37, P = 0.02).\nConclusion: The high proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and independent factors for mortality suggest that early diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients in LTCFs may be effective in saving lives.\nIntroduction\nAs of 02 June 2020, 10 350 elderly residents living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) or medical-social establishments in France had died from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (27.6% fatality rate), accounting for 55.6% of COVID-19 deaths in France. Similar pictures have also been reported in many European countries and worldwide. The prevalence of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes mellitus is high among elderly people living in LTCFs; COVID-19 in this population may therefore have severe outcomes with a high mortality rate. Other drivers of mortality among elderly people living in LTCFs already include type of facility, the number of people visiting the facilities during the week prior to lockdown, staff ratios, and lagged infection in staff members.\nThe treatment of COVID-19 has been the subject of widespread controversy, particularly regarding to the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). It appears that some of the elements of the controversy are the heterogeneity of protocols using HCQ, with doses ranging from 800-1200 mg per day, the duration of treatment, whether or not it is combined with azithromycin (AZM), and the stage of the disease at which patients are treated. It can be considered that there is a purely viral phase of the disease, with a more or less strong immune response, which can become predominant, in what has been referred to as the cytokine storm, followed in a number of cases by necrotic lesions, linked to pulmonary infarctions. Furthermore, mortality depends very significantly on age; therefore, almost all deaths in Europe have been among people aged &gt; 60 years, with &gt; 50% in people aged &gt; 85 years. Under these conditions it is very difficult to carry out comparative studies addressing the effect of HCQ on COVID-19-associated deaths. Very few randomised studies have been conducted and their interpretations have also led to heated debate. To assist the debate, it is believed that it may be important to assess whether there is a clear reduction in mortality in the most at-risk groups.\nIn Marseille, over a period of approximately two months, this study was able to test and treat COVID-19 patients in LTCFs with a combination of HCQ-AZM, as has been described on several occasions. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage among elderly residents and staff members working in 24 LTCFs in Marseille, France. It also aimed to estimate the fatality among elderly residents treated in these LTCFs and informally compare it with the fatality of people in these LTCFs who were not treated and the general fatality of people in LTCFs in France.\nMethods\nSetting, study design and population\nSARS-CoV-2 cross-sectional mass screening campaigns were conducted among residents and staff members from 24 LTCFs in Marseille, between 24 March and 02 June 2020. In some centres, screening campaigns were conducted following the diagnosis of confirmed COVID-19 cases in symptomatic patients who were sampled on a case-by-case strategy. In other centres, screening campaigns were systematically conducted. In all cases, screening campaigns were conducted following a request from the directors and medical staff of the LTCFs. Nasopharyngeal samples were processed for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing at the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire (IHU) Mediterranee Infection at Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille (AP-HM), as previously described or in private laboratories in Marseille, in some cases. Residents who tested positive were: i) treated at their LTCFs by local medical staff only; ii) treated at their LTCFs in coordination with the AP-HM Home Hospitalisation Unit (HHU); iii) admitted to the IHU (day-care hospital or conventional units); or iv) transferred to the AP-MH Intensive Care Unit (ICU). For confirmed cases, information on demographics, chronic medical conditions, COVID-19 treatment and clinical data - including fever, asthenia, anorexia and weight loss, respiratory symptoms and signs (cough, rhinorrhoea, dyspnoea, chest pain, acute respiratory distress syndrome) and death - were retrospectively collected from interviews with the medical team of 24 LTCFs and the electronic health recording systems of the AP-HM.\nStatistical methods\nStatistical procedures were performed using STATA 11.1. Pearson's chi2 or Fisher's exact tests to compare between-group differences of patients, where appropriate. A two-sided P-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. A separate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 death prevalence among all elderly residents testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The results were presented by percentages and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The initial model included variables presenting P &lt; 0.2. The stepwise regression procedure and likelihood-ratio tests were applied to determine the final model.\nResults\nSARS-CoV-2 testing among residents and staff members at 24 long-term care facilities in Marseille, France, 27 March-2 June 2020.\nTable 1	 	\nCharacteristics	Residents	Staff members	Total		 		Date of mass testing	No. tested	No. (%) positive	No. (%) deaths among positive cases (fatality rate)	No. tested	No. (%) positive	No. (%) deaths among positive cases (fatality rate)	P-value1	P-value2	No. tested	No. (%) positive	 	Total		1691	226 (13.4)	47 (20.8)	1000	87 (8.7)	0 (0)	&lt; 0.001	&lt; 0.001	2691	313 (11.6)	 	Centre (26 91)												 	01	01 April, 08 April, 19 April	99	57 (57.6)	17 (29.9)	83	20 (24.1)	0 (0)	0.002	0.04	182	77 (42.3)	 	02	08 April, 19 April, 20 May	112	50 (44.6)	9 (18.0)	71	17 (24.0)	0 (0)	0.007	0.053	183	67 (36.6)	 	03	20 April, 26 April, 04 May, 11 May, 18 May, 25 May, 02 June	52	23 (44.2)	2 (8.7)	35	7 (20.0)	0 (0)	0.002	N/A	87	30 (34.5)	 	04	06 April, 21 April	89	24 (27.0)	8 (33.3)	108	12 (11.1)	0 (0)	0.007	0.03	197	36 (18.3)	 	05	08 April, 29 April	37	10 (27.1)	3 (30.0)	32	1 (3.1)	0 (0)	0.035	N/A	69	11 (16.0)	 	06	08 April, 17 April, 22 April	230	45 (18.0)	7 (15.6)	180	15 (8.3)	0 (0)	0.002	0.18	410	60 (14.9)	 	07	02 Avril, 27 April, 25 May	81	8 (9.9)	0 (0)	57	11 (19.3)	0 (0)	0.18	N/A	138	19 (13.8)	 	08	13 April, 06 May	77	7 (9.1)	1 (14.3)	24	1 (4.2)	0 (0)	0.67	N/A	101	8 (7.9)	 	09	21 April	54	0 (0)	N/A	44	3 (6.8)	0 (0)	0.08	N/A	98	3 (3.1)	 	10	23 April	46	1 (2.2)	0 (0)	12	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	58	1 (1.7)	 	11	15 April	118	1 (0.9)	0 (0)	60	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	178	1 (0.6)	 	12	15 April	66	0 (0)	N/A	18	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	84	0 (0)	 	13	28 April	96	0 (0)	N/A	39	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	135	0 (0)	 	14	30 April	45	0 (0)	N/A	12	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	57	0 (0)	 	15	17 April	64	0 (0)	N/A	27	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	91	0 (0)	 	16	22 April	48	0 (0)	N/A	19	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	67	0 (0)	 	17	25 April	61	0 (0)	N/A	29	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	90	0 (0)	 	18	15 April	52	0 (0)	N/A	18	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	70	0 (0)	 	19	27 April	32	0 (0)	N/A	24	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	56	0 (0)	 	20	27 April	29	0 (0)	N/A	15	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	44	0 (0)	 	21	24 April	25	0 (0)	N/A	11	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	36	0 (0)	 	22	20 April	53	0 (0)	N/A	22	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	75	0 (0)	 	23	14 April	100	0 (0)	N/A	52	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	152	0 (0)	 	24	24 April	25	0 (0)	N/A	8	0 (0)	N/A	N/A	N/A	33	0 (0)	 	Sex (2471)												 	Female, n (%)		1069 (64.8)	135 (12.6)	19 (14.1)	646 (77.7)					1705 (69.0)		 	Male, n (%)		581 (35.2)	91 (15.7)	28 (30.8)	185 (22.3)					766 (31.0)		 	Age (years) (2556)												 	Mean +- SD		83.0 +- 10.6	83.4 +- 10.6	86.8 +- 10.2	40.8 +- 12.7					68.3 +- 23.1		 	Range (min-max)		50-106	56-103	59-103	18-87					18-106		 	18-34, n (%)		0 (0)	N/A	N/A	326 (36.4)					326 (12.8)		 	35-49, n (%)		0 (0)	N/A	N/A	292 (32.6)					292 (11.4)		 	50-59, n (%)		34 (2.1)	3 (8.8)	1 (33.3)	236 (25.4)					270 (10.6)		 	60-69, n (%)		189 (11.4)	25 (13.2)	3 (12.0)	38 (4.2)					227 (8.9)		 	70-79, n (%)		348 (21.0)	46 (13.2)	5 (10.9)	1 (0.1)					349 (13.7)		 	80-89, n (%)		552 (33.2)	78 (14.1)	16 (20.5)	1 (0.1)					553 (21.6)		 	90-99, n (%)		505 (30.3)	67 (13.3)	19 (28.4)	0 (0)					505 (19.8)		 	&gt; 99, n (%)		34 (2.1)	7 (20.6)	3(42.9)	0 (0)					34 (1.3)		 	\nAbbreviation: N/A, not applicable.\nComparison of positive testing prevalence between resident group and staff member group.\nComparison of fatality rates between infected resident group and infected staff member group. 3Number of individuals for whom data were available.\nOver the study period, 1691 elderly residents and 1000 staff members were tested (Table 1 ). For residents, the sex ratio (male to female) was 1:1.8 and the mean age (+- standard derivation [SD]) was 83.0 (+- 10.6) years (range 50-106 years). For staff members, the sex ratio was 1:3.5 and the mean age (+- SD) was 40.8 (+- 12.8) years (range 18-87 years). It should be noted that two religious staff members at one LTCF were aged 75 years and 87 years, respectively.\nOverall, 313 participants (of 2691, 11.6%) were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. The prevalence among residents (226 of 1691, 13.4%) was significantly higher than among staff members (87 of 1000, 8.7%; P &lt; 0.001). With regard to the housing facilities, at least one individual was positive in 11/24 (45.8%) centres, with prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 detection ranging 0-57.6% among residents and 0-24.1% among staff members (Table 1). The fatality rate among residents was 20.8%, while no deaths occurred among staff members (P &lt; 0.001).\nCharacteristics of 226 elderly residents testing positive for SARS-CoV-2\nComorbidities, symptoms and signs, diagnostic and therapeutic management among 226 elderly residents testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.\nTable 2	 	\nParameters	n (%)	 	Comorbidities (159)1		 	Hypertension	63 (39.6)	 	Cardiovascular diseases (other than hypertension)	59 (37.1)	 	Dementia	46 (28.9)	 	Mental disorder	39 (23.6)	 	Diabetes mellitus	25 (15.7)	 	Chronic lung diseases	19 (12.0)	 	Stroke	17 (10.7)	 	Cancer	15 (9.4)	 	Chronic neurological disorder	12 (7.6)	 	Obesity	7 (4.4)	 	Chronic kidney diseases	7 (4.4)	 	Asthma	3 (1.9)	 	Symptoms and signs (200)		 	Respiratory symptoms and signs	89 (44.5)	 	Fever	93 (46.5)	 	Asthenia, anorexia, weight loss	21 (10.5)	 	No COVID-19 symptoms	46 (23.0)	 	Circumstances of diagnosis (226)		 	Case-by-case testing in patients with COVID-19 symptoms	37 (16.4)	 	Mass testing	189 (83.6)	 	Medical management of patients (226)		 	Managed at LTCFs by local medical staff only	62 (27.4)	 	Managed at LTCFs in coordination with the HHU	117 (51.8)	 	Admitted to IHU	16 (7.1)	 	Transferred ICU	31 (13.7)	 	HCQ-AZM therapy (226)		 	At least a 3-day course	116 (51.4)	 	2-day course	1 (0.4)	 	HCQ alone	1 (0.4)	 	AZM alone	37 (16.4)	 	No HCQ, no AZM	71 (31.4)	 	HCQ-AZM therapy at least a 3-day course according to the housing facilities (226)		 	Centre 07, n/N (%)	7/8 (87.5)	 	Centre 01, n/N (%)	39/50 (78.0)	 	Centre 02, n/N (%)	43/57 (75.4)	 	Centre 05, n/N (%)	4/10 (40.0)	 	Centre 06, n/N (%)	14/45 (31.1)	 	Centre 04, n/N (%)	4/23 (17.3)	 	Centre 03, n/N (%)	4/24 (16.7)	 	Centre 08, n/N (%)	1/7 (14.3)	 	Centre 10, n/N (%)	0/1 (0)	 	Centre 11, n/N (%)	0/1 (0)	 	Oxygen therapy (199)	59 (29.7)	 	Ceftriaxone or ertapenem therapy (199)	63 (31.6)	 	Low-molecular-weight heparin therapy (199)	24 (12.1)	 	\nAbbreviations: HCQ, hydroxychloroquine; AZM, azithromycin; HHU, Home Hospitalisation Unit; IHU, Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire; ICU, Intensive Care Unit; LTCFs, long-term care facilities\nNumber of individuals for whom data were available.\nOf the 226 SARS-CoV-2-positive elderly residents, 37 were diagnosed on a case-by-case basis through selected sampling of patients with COVID-19 symptoms, and 189 (83.4%) were detected through mass screening.

Under univariate analysis, death from COVID-19 was significantly associated with being male. In addition, patients who were diagnosed on a case-by case basis due to their COVID-19 symptoms were more likely to die (40.5%) than those diagnosed through systematic screening (16.9%). Finally, patients who received oxygen treatment were more likely to die (39.0%) than those who did not receive such a treatment (12.9%). In contrast, patients who received HCQ-AZM treatment for at least three days were less likely to die (15.5%) than those who did not receive such treatment (26.4%). Through multivariate analysis, the death rate was positively associated with being male (30.7% vs. 14.0%, OR = 3.95 [1.65-9.44]; P = 0.002), aged &gt; 85 years (26.1% vs. 15.6%, OR = 2.43 [1.04-5.69]; P = 0.041) and receiving oxygen therapy (OR = 5.16 [2.26-11.76]; P &lt; 0.001), and negatively associated with being diagnosed through mass screening (16.9% vs. 40.5%, OR = 0.20 [0.08-0.53]; P = 0.001) and receiving HCQ-AZM treatment for at least three days (OR = 0.37 [0.17-0.86]; P = 0.02).\nDiscussion\nThe first case of COVID-19 in the general population of Marseille was diagnosed on 03 March 2020. The epidemic peaked during the first week of April and remained active until the end of the month. This survey of LTCFs began when the entire French population was placed under strict lockdown (17 March 2020) and when the epidemic was active in Marseille. All LTCFs became confined environments with very strict restrictions being placed upon visits. A 13.4% SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was found among dependant elderly residents in Marseille, which was significantly higher than the 5.4% positivity rate among all French dependant elderly residents, according to a national survey (37 405 confirmed cases in an estimated 695 060 French dependant elderly residents, P &lt; 0.001, 02 June update). The current study observed an overall 20.8% COVID-19 fatality rate among infected residents in Marseille, which was significantly lower than that in all French LTCFs or medical-social establishments (27.7% fatality rate, P = 0.026, 02 June update).\nThe main drivers of mortality in Marseille residents were older age and being male, as already reported in many studies. In addition, systematic screening by PCR was identified as an independent protective factor against death from COVID-19. A symptom-based diagnostic strategy is less effective in LTCFs, most likely because elderly residents with comorbidities such as chronic respiratory or cardiovascular diseases may be unable to accurately report new symptoms suggestive of COVID-infection or may present with atypical symptoms that challenge medical staff. Furthermore, from experience, &gt; 23% of SARS-CoV-2-infected residents had no symptoms at the time of sampling. A very high prevalence (ca. 80%) was observed in a cross-sectional study conducted on elderly residents living in 2074 Belgian LTCFs. The current study showed that there was a significant difference in fatality between patients treated with standardised treatment and untreated patients, as already reported in a study conducted among elderly patients living in a Spanish public nursing home in the same period.\nTreatment with HCQ alone was demonstrated to be associated with lower mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19. Another cohort study conducted among American patients with rheumatic conditions showed an association between long-term HCQ treatment and reduced COVID-19 fatality rate. The potential mechanisms of HCQ in the decrease of mortality in COVID-19 might be its inhibitory effects upon the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1-beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6, and chemokines (CCL2 and CCL3) involved in the recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells in the lungs.\nThe current study had some limitations: the population was not randomly and homogenously recruited; data regarding demographics, chronic conditions and clinical status were not systematically documented; frailty, which has been shown to be a major risk factor for mortality in COVID-19, was not evaluated due to the retrospective design; and the use of individual preventive measures was not documented.\nNevertheless, it is believed that even if there were biases, as in any comparative study including randomisation, these biases were relatively neutralised by the multifactorial study. Above all, it was demonstrated that the mortality in patients treated in LTCFs in Marseille was half that of those in nursing homes across France who, in most cases, very likely did not receive specific treatment, since its use is restricted to the hospital setting. The current authors believe that it is important to focus on the population with the highest mortality, to show a significant effect, and agree in this sense with several studies that have shown a reduction in mortality of 30% to 50% by HCQ-AZM in populations most at risk.\nDeclarations\nFunding: This work was supported by the French Government under the 'Investments for the Future' programme managed by the National Agency for Research (ANR), Mediterranee-Infection 10-IAHU-03, and was also supported by Region Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur.

synthesis of the literature on the burden of respiratory infections in the LTCF setting is lacking.\n\n To address the critical need for evidence regarding the global burden of respiratory infections in LTCFs, we assessed the burden of respiratory infections in LTCFs through a systematic review of the published literature.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We identified articles published between April 1964 and March 2019 through searches of PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library.\n\n Experimental and observational studies published in English that included adults aged ?60 residing in LTCFs

Among 76 residents who participated in point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) tested positive.\n\n Of these 48 residents, 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days).\n\n Samples from these 24 presymptomatic residents had a median rRT-PCR cycle threshold value of 23.1, and viable virus was recovered from 17 residents.\n\n As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%).\n\n Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide.\n\n\nConclusions\nRapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility.\n\n More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission.\n\n Infection-control strategies focused solely on symptomatic residents were not sufficient to prevent transmission after SARS-CoV-2 introduction into this facility.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7200056","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Melissa M.","surname":"Arons","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kelly M.","surname":"Hatfield","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sujan C.","surname":"Reddy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anne","surname":"Kimball","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Allison","surname":"James","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jesica R.","surname":"Jacobs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joanne","surname":"Taylor","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"Spicer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ana C.","surname":"Bardossy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lisa P.","surname":"Oakley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sukarma","surname":"Tanwar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan W.","surname":"Dyal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Josh","surname":"Harney","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zeshan","surname":"Chisty","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeneita M.","surname":"Bell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Methner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Prabasaj","surname":"Paul","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christina M.","surname":"Carlson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heather P.","surname":"McLaughlin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Natalie","surname":"Thornburg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Suxiang","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Azaibi","surname":"Tamin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Uehara","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jennifer","surname":"Harcourt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shauna","surname":"Clark","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claire","surname":"Brostrom-Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Libby C.","surname":"Page","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meagan","surname":"Kay","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James","surname":"Lewis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patty","surname":"Montgomery","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nimalie D.","surname":"Stone","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas A.","surname":"Clark","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Margaret A.","surname":"Honein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeffrey S.","surname":"Duchin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John A.","surname":"Jernigan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Sciensano.

(SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention.\n On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern.\n The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century.\n As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO.\n Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to ?-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host.\n The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract.\n Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe.\n The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms.\n The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm.\n Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.\n In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.\n","id":"PMC7068984","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

also demonstrated that CQ attenuates ZIKV-associated morbidity and mortality in mice.\n Finally, we proved that CQ protects fetal mice from microcephaly caused by ZIKV infection.\n Our methodology of focusing on previously identified antivirals in screens for effectiveness against ZIKV proved to be a rapid and efficient means of discovering new ZIKV therapeutics.\n Selecting drugs that were previously FDA-approved, such as CQ, also improves the likelihood that they may more quickly reach stages of clinical testing and use by the

Retinal toxicity is the most important side effects of this drug.\n Even after the drug is discontinued, retinal degeneration from HCQ can continue to progress.\n Consequently, multiple ophthalmic screening tests have been developed to detect early retinopathy.\n The aim of the current study was to evaluate the value of central 2-10 perimetry method in early detection of retinal toxicity.\n This prospective cross-sectional investigation was carried out on 60 rheumatoid arthritis patients, who had been receiving HCQ for at least 6 months and still were on their medication (HCQ intake) at the time of enrollment.\n An ophthalmologist examined participants using direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy.\n Visual field testing with automated perimetry technique (central 2-10 perimetry with red target) was performed on all included subjects twice in 6 months interval: The first one at the time of enrollment and the second one 6 months later.\n Males and females did not show any significant difference in terms of age, duration of therapy, daily and cumulative HCQ dose, anterior or posterior segment abnormalities, hypertension, body mass index, and best corrected visual acuity.\n Anterior segment was abnormal in 9 individuals including 3 subjects with macular pigmentary changes, 4 individuals with cataract and 2 cases with dry eyes.\n Moreover, 12 subjects had retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) in their posterior segments.\n After 6 months, depressive changes appeared in 12 subjects.\n Additionally, HCQ therapy worsened significantly the perimetric results of 5 (55.6%) patients with abnormal anterior segment.\n A same trend was observed in perimetric results of 6 (50.0%) subjects with abnormal posterior segments (P=0.009).\n The daily dose of HCQ (P=0.035) as well as the cumulative dose of hydroxychloroquine (P=0.021) displayed statistically significant associations with perimetric results.\n Central 2-10 perimetry is a useful method for early detection of HCQ retinal toxicity, but more comprehensive studies, with larger sample size, longer-term follow-up and more precise techniques are mandatory to confirm HCQ retinal toxicity.\n","id":"PMC4803972","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Canadian Center of Science and

shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro as well as in vivo and has been proposed to alter the glycosylation pattern of the gp120 envelope.\n\n These activities indicate that the compound can be used not only as an effective HIV-1 therapeutic agent but also as a modulator of the gp120 envelope protein structure enabling for the production of broader neutralizing Ab responses.\n\n\nResults\nWe confirm here that HIV-1 replication on CD4+ T-lymphocytes can be reduced in the presence of CQ and show that the reduced replication is producer cell mediated, with viruses generated in the presence of CQ not being inhibited for subsequent infectivity and replication.\n\n By analysing the gp120 envelope protein sequences from viruses cultured long-term in the absence or presence of CQ we demonstrate variant evolution patterns.\n\n One noticeable change is the reduction in the number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the V3 region as well as within the 2G12 Ab binding and neutralization epitope.\n\n We also demonstrate that HIV-1 produced in the presence of CQ has a reduced capacity for transfer by Raji-DC-SIGN cells to CD4+ T-lymphocytes, indicating another means whereby virus transmission or replication may be reduced in vivo.\n\n\nConclusion\nThese results indicate that CQ should be considered as an HIV-1 therapeutic agent with its influence exerted through

The keywords ‘hydroxychloroquine’, ‘chloroquine’, ‘coronavirus’, ‘COVID-19’ and ‘SARS-Cov-2’ were used in the PubMed, Google Scholar and Google search engines without any restrictions as to date or language.\n Twenty studies were identified involving 105 040 patients (19 270 treated patients) from nine countries (Brazil, China, France, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain and the USA).\n Big data observational studies were associated with conflict of interest, lack of treatment dosage and duration, and absence of favourable outcome.\n Clinical studies were associated with favourable outcomes and details on therapy.\n Among clinical studies, three of four randomized controlled trials reported a significant favourable effect.\n Among clinical studies, a significant favourable summary effect was observed for duration of cough (OR 0.19, p 0.00003), duration of fever (OR 0.11, p 0.039), clinical cure (OR 0.21, p 0.0495), death (OR 0.32, p 4.1 × 10?6) and viral shedding (OR 0.43, p 0.031).\n A trend for a favourable effect was noted for the outcome ‘death and/or intensive care unit transfer’ (OR 0.29, p 0.069) with a point estimate remarkably similar to that observed for death (?0.3).\n In conclusion, a meta-analysis of publicly available clinical reports demonstrates that chloroquine derivatives are effective to improve clinical and virological outcomes, but, more importantly, they reduce mortality by a factor of 3 in patients with COVID-19. Big data are lacking basic treatment definitions and are linked to conflict of interest.\n The retraction of the only big data study associated with a significantly deleterious effect the day after (June 5, 2020) the acceptance of the present work (June 4, 2020) confirms the relevance of this work.\n","id":"PMC7558783","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Million","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Gautret","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Colson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.","surname":"Roussel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"G.","surname":"Dubourg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"E.","surname":"Chabriere","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Honore","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.-M.","surname":"Rolain","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"F.","surname":"Fenollar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.-E.","surname":"Fournier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.-C.","surname":"Lagier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Parola","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Brouqui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.","surname":"Raoult","email":"didier.raoult@gmail.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A trial of lopinavir-ritonavir in adults hospitalized with severe covid-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Remdesivir in adults with severe COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s11427-020-1732-2","date":"2020-05-12","title":"Low dose of hydroxychloroquine reduces fatality of critically ill patients with COVID-19","abstract":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific drugs and high fatality.\n The most urgent need is to find effective treatments.\n We sought to determine whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) application may reduce the death risk of critically ill COVID-19 patients.\n In this retrospective study, we included 550 critically ill COVID-19 patients who need mechanical ventilation in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, from February 1, 2020 to April 4, 2020.

four days).\n\n Outcomes were death, clinical worsening (transfer to ICU, and &gt;10 day hospitalization) and viral shedding persistence (&gt;10 days).\n\n\nResults\nA total of 1061 patients were included in this analysis (46.4% male, mean age 43.6 years – range 14–95 years).\n\n Good clinical outcome and virological cure were obtained in 973 patients within 10 days (91.7%).\n\n Prolonged

An electronic questionnaire was completed by general cardiologists and electrophysiologists working in African countries.\n\n The questionnaire focused on availability of human resources, diagnostic tools and treatment modalities in each country.\n\n\nResults\nWe received responses from physicians in 33 out of 55 (60%) African countries.\n\n Limited use of basic cardiovascular drugs such as anti–arrhythmics and anticoagulants prevails.\n\n Non–vitamin K–dependent oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are not widely used on the continent, even in North Africa.\n\n Six (18%) of the sub–Saharan African (SSA) countries do not have a registered cardiologist and about one–third do not have pacemaker services.\n\n The median pacemaker implantation rate was 2.66 per million population per country, which is 200–fold lower than in Europe.\n\n The density of pacemaker facilities and operators in Africa is quite low, with a median of 0.14 (0.03–6.36) centres and 0.10 (0.05–9.49) operators

\nConclusion\nThe lack of diagnostic and treatment services for cardiac arrhythmias is a common scenario in the majority of SSA countries, resulting in sub–optimal care and a subsequent high burden of

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

and DNA Bacteriophages as Molecular Diagnosis Controls in Clinical Virology: A Comprehensive Study of More than 45,000 Routine PCR Tests","abstract":"Real-time PCR techniques are now commonly used for the detection of viral genomes in various human specimens and require for validation both external and internal controls (ECs and ICs).\n In particular, ICs added to clinical samples are necessary to monitor the extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification steps in order to detect false-negative results resulting from PCR-inhibition or errors in the technical procedure.\n Here, we performed a large scale evaluation of the use of bacteriophages as ICs in routine molecular diagnosis.\n This allowed to propose simple standardized procedures (i) to design specific ECs for both DNA and RNA viruses and (ii) to use T4 (DNA) or MS2 (RNA) phages as ICs in routine diagnosis.\n Various technical formats for using phages as ICs were optimised and validated.\n Subsequently, T4 and MS2 ICs were evaluated in routine real-time PCR or RT-PCR virological diagnostic tests, using a series of 8,950 clinical samples (representing 36 distinct specimen types) sent to our laboratory for the detection of a variety of DNA and RNA viruses.\n The frequency of inefficient detection of ICs was analyzed according to the nature of the sample.\n Inhibitors of enzymatic reactions were detected at high frequency in specific sample types such as heparinized blood and bone marrow (&gt;70%), broncho-alveolar liquid (41%) and stools (36%).\n The use of T4 and MS2 phages as ICs proved to be cost-effective, flexible and adaptable to various technical procedures of real-time PCR detection in virology.\n It represents a valuable strategy for enhancing the quality of routine molecular diagnosis in laboratories that use in-house designed diagnostic systems, which can conveniently be associated to the use of specific synthetic ECs.\n The high rate of inhibitors observed in a variety of specimen types should stimulate the elaboration of improved technical protocols for the extraction and amplification of nucleic acids.\n","id":"PMC3036576","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

POC-lab was located close to the core laboratory and emergency ward to test the proof of concept.\n\n A second POC-lab was located inside the emergency ward of a distant hospital without a microbiology laboratory.\n\n Twenty-three molecular and immuno-detection tests, which were technically undemanding, were progressively implemented, with results obtained in less than four hours.\n\n From 2008 to 2010, 51,179 tests yielded 6,244 diagnoses.\n\n The second POC-lab detected contagious pathogens in 982 patients who benefited from targeted isolation measures, including those undertaken during the influenza outbreak.\n\n POC tests prevented unnecessary treatment of patients with non-streptococcal tonsillitis (n?=?1,844) and pregnant women negative for Streptococcus agalactiae carriage (n?=?763).\n\n The cerebrospinal fluid culture remained sterile in 50% of the 49 patients with bacterial meningitis, therefore antibiotic treatment was guided by the molecular tests performed in the POC-labs.\n\n With regard to enterovirus meningitis, the mean length-of-stay of infected patients over 15 years old significantly decreased from 2008 to 2010 compared with 2005 when the POC was

city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

among Hajj pilgrims.\n\n However, it is still not known whether viruses are responsible for the symptoms observed in sick pilgrims or whether they only colonize sick and asymptomatic pilgrims.\n\n\nPatients and methods\nA prospective cohort study was conducted among French Hajj pilgrims in 2016. Medical follow-up and systematic nasal swabbing were performed pre- and post-Hajj.\n\n Additional samples were obtained per-Hajj, at symptom onset in ill pilgrims.\n\n Viruses were identified using the BioFire FilmArray® Respiratory multiplex qualitative PCR panel.\n\n\nResults\n109 pilgrims were included.\n\n 83.5% presented respiratory symptoms during Hajj and 39.5% were still symptomatic on

nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) collected from confirmed patients during the first 8 weeks of the SARS outbreak in 2003 were tested for hMPV by a nested RT-PCR assay targeting the F-gene.\n\n Clinico-epidemiological information was used to analyze the relationship of hMPV co-infection to specific risk factors (demographics/symptoms/outcomes; status as health-care workers (HCWs)/patients; history of exposure/contact; ward location).\n\n Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors.\n\n\nResults\nAn hMPV outbreak occurred during 6–16

outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility.\n\n Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented.\n\n Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively.\n\n The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101).\n\n As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7121761","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Temet

Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome data of patients with GI symptoms were analysed using multivariate analysis for risk of severe/critical type.\n\n Bioinformatics were used to analyse features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province.\n\n\nResults\nAmong enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4%) presented with at least one GI symptom (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-day incubation period and 10.8% had pre-existing liver disease.\n\n Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 17 (22.97%) and 23 (31.08%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without GI symptoms, 47 (8.14%) and 118 (20.45%).\n\n Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 29 (39.19%), 23 (31.08%), 8 (10.81%) and 16 (21.62%) had significantly higher rates of fever &gt;38.5°C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, respectively.\n\n Low-dose glucocorticoids and

of laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection.\n\n The median age was 58 years and 235 were male.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia.\n\n Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.\n\n Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines.\n\n The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases.\n\n Both

The keywords ‘hydroxychloroquine’, ‘chloroquine’, ‘coronavirus’, ‘COVID-19’ and ‘SARS-Cov-2’ were used in the PubMed, Google Scholar and Google search engines without any restrictions as to date or language.\n Twenty studies were identified involving 105 040 patients (19 270 treated patients) from nine countries (Brazil, China, France, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain and the USA).\n Big data observational studies were associated with conflict of interest, lack of treatment dosage and duration, and absence of favourable outcome.\n Clinical studies were associated with favourable outcomes and details on therapy.\n Among clinical studies, three of four randomized controlled trials reported a significant favourable effect.\n Among clinical studies, a significant favourable summary effect was observed for duration of cough (OR 0.19, p 0.00003), duration of fever (OR 0.11, p 0.039), clinical cure (OR 0.21, p 0.0495), death (OR 0.32, p 4.1 × 10?6) and viral shedding (OR 0.43, p 0.031).\n A trend for a favourable effect was noted for the outcome ‘death and/or intensive care unit transfer’ (OR 0.29, p 0.069) with a point estimate remarkably similar to that observed for death (?0.3).\n In conclusion, a meta-analysis of publicly available clinical reports demonstrates that chloroquine derivatives are effective to improve clinical and virological outcomes, but, more importantly, they reduce mortality by a factor of 3 in patients with COVID-19. Big data are lacking basic treatment definitions and are linked to conflict of interest.\n The retraction of the only big data study associated with a significantly deleterious effect the day after (June 5, 2020) the acceptance of the present work (June 4, 2020) confirms the relevance of this work.\n","id":"PMC7558783","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Million","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Gautret","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Colson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y.","surname":"Roussel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"G.","surname":"Dubourg","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"E.","surname":"Chabriere","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Honore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.-M.","surname":"Rolain","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"F.","surname":"Fenollar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.-E.","surname":"Fournier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.-C.","surname":"Lagier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Parola","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Brouqui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"D.","surname":"Raoult","email":"didier.raoult@gmail.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Chen L, Zhang Z, Fu J, et al.

related antimalarial drugs: a systematic review","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Several quinoline and structurally related antimalarial drugs are associated with cardiovascular side effects, particularly hypotension and electrocardiographic QT interval prolongation.\n\n A prolonged QT interval is a sensitive but not specific risk marker for the development of Torsade de Pointes—a potentially lethal polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia.\n\n The increasing use of quinoline and structurally related antimalarials in mass treatments to eliminate malaria rapidly highlights the need to review their cardiovascular safety profiles.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>The primary objective of this systematic review was to describe the documented clinical and electrocardiographic cardiovascular side effects of quinine, mefloquine, lumefantrine, piperaquine, halofantrine, chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, amodiaquine, and primaquine.\n\n Trials in healthy subjects or patients with Plasmodium falciparum or P.\n\n vivax infection were included if at least two ECGs were conducted during the trial.\n\n All trial designs were included except case reports and pooled analyses.\n\n Secondary outcomes were the methods adopted by trials for measuring and reporting the QT interval.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Data from trials published between 1982 and July 2016 were included.\n\n A total of 177 trials met the inclusion criteria.\n\n 35,448 participants received quinoline antimalarials in these trials, of which 18,436 participants underwent ECG evaluation.\n\n Subjects with co-medication use or comorbidities including cardiovascular disease were excluded from the majority of trials.\n\n Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was the drug most studied (5083 participants).\n\n Despite enormous use over the past 60 years, only 1076, 452, and 150 patients had ECG recordings reported in studies of chloroquine, amodiaquine, and primaquine respectively.\n\n Transiently high concentrations of quinine, quinidine, and chloroquine following parenteral administration have all been associated with hypotension, but there were no documented reports of death or syncope attributable to a cardiovascular cause, nor of electrocardiographic recordings of ventricular arrhythmia in these trials.\n\n The large volume of missing outcome information and the heterogeneity of ECG interval reporting and measurement methodology did not allow pooled quantitative analysis of QT interval changes.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>No serious cardiac adverse effects were recorded in malaria clinical trials of 35,548 participants who received quinoline and structurally related antimalarials with close follow-up including 18,436 individuals who underwent ECG evaluation.\n\n While these findings provide further evidence of the rarity of serious cardiovascular events after treatment with these drugs, they also underscore the need for continued strengthening of pharmacovigilance systems for robust detection of rare drug adverse events in real-world populations.\n\n A standardised approach to measurement and reporting of ECG data in malaria trials is also needed.\n\n\nTrial registration\nid='Par5'>PROSPERO CRD42016036678\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12916-018-1188-2) contains supplementary material,

differences in means and differences in proportions in observational studies","abstract":"In a study comparing the effects of two treatments, the propensity score is the probability of assignment to one treatment conditional on a subject's measured baseline covariates.\n Propensity-score matching is increasingly being used to estimate the effects of exposures using observational data.\n In the most common implementation of propensity-score matching, pairs of treated and untreated subjects are formed whose propensity scores differ by at most a pre-specified amount (the caliper width).\n There has been a little research into the optimal caliper width.\n We conducted an extensive series of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the optimal caliper width for estimating differences in means (for continuous outcomes) and risk differences (for binary outcomes).\n When estimating differences in means or risk differences, we recommend that researchers match on the logit of the propensity score using calipers of width equal to 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score.\n When at least some of the covariates were continuous, then either this value, or one close to it, minimized the mean square error of the resultant estimated treatment effect.\n It also eliminated at least 98% of the bias in the crude estimator, and it resulted in confidence intervals with approximately the correct coverage rates.\n Furthermore, the empirical type I error rate was approximately correct.\n When all of the covariates were binary, then the choice of caliper width had a much smaller impact on the performance of estimation of risk differences and differences in means.\n Copyright © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons,

against Covid-19.\nMethods\nWe conducted an observational, retrospective cohort study involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed, mild to severe Covid-19 in a French university hospital.\n\n Patients who received hydroxychloroquine (200mg tid dosage for 10 days) on a compassionate basis in addition to SOCwere compared to patients without contraindications to hydroxychloroquine who received SOCalone.\n\n A propensity score-weighted analysis was performed to control for confounders: age, sex, time between symptom onset and admission ? 7 days, Charlson comorbidity index, medical history of arterial hypertension, and obesity, NEWS2 score at admission, and pneumonia severity.\n\n The primary endpoint was time to unfavorable outcome, defined as: death, admission to an intensive care unit, or decision to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatments, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nData from 89 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 were analyzed, 84 of whom were considered in the primary analysis; 38 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and 46 patients treated with SOCalone.\n\n At admission, the mean age of patients was 66 years, the median Charlson

The study continues to enrol at the time of this report.\n\n In study participants, mortality was high, independent risk factors were increasing age, male sex, and chronic comorbidity, including obesity.\n\n This study has shown the importance of pandemic preparedness and the need to maintain readiness to launch research studies in response to outbreaks.\n\n\nStudy registration\nISRCTN66726260.\n","id":"PMC7243036","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Annemarie B","surname":"Docherty","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ewen M","surname":"Harrison","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher A","surname":"Green","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hayley E","surname":"Hardwick","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Riinu","surname":"Pius","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lisa","surname":"Norman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Karl A","surname":"Holden","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jonathan M","surname":"Read","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frank","surname":"Dondelinger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gail","surname":"Carson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Merson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Plotkin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Louise","surname":"Sigfrid","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sophie","surname":"Halpin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Clare","surname":"Jackson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carrol","surname":"Gamble","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter W","surname":"Horby","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan S","surname":"Nguyen-Van-Tam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Antonia","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Clark D","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jake","surname":"Dunning","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter JM","surname":"Openshaw","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J Kenneth","surname":"Baillie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Malcolm G","surname":"Semple","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.6775","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Presenting characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes among 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York City area","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2021436","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Dexamethasone in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19 — Preliminary Report","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage.\n\n Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care.\n\n Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83;

hydroxychloroquine use in patients with rheumatic conditions and development of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nHydroxychloroquine is one of several agents being evaluated in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n\n We aimed to examine whether patients with rheumatological conditions receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy are at less risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection than those not receiving hydroxychloroquine.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective cohort study included de-identified information of all veterans in the US Veterans Health Administration clinical administrative database aged 18 years or older with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or associated rheumatological conditions (based on International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, diagnostic codes) who were alive on March 1, 2020. A propensity score was calculated for each patient, and each patient who was receiving hydroxychloroquine was matched to two patients who were not receiving hydroxychloroquine (controls).\n\n The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among those receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine versus the propensity-matched patients not receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine between March 1 and June 30, 2020. Secondary outcomes were hospital admission associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; intensive care requirement associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; and overall rates of any hospital admission and mortality (ie, all cause).\n\n Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine independent variables for the development of active SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 1 and June 30, 2020, 10?703 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and 21?406 patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine were included in the primary analysis.\n\n The incidence of active SARS-CoV-2 infections during the study period did not differ between patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine (31 [0·3%] of 10?703 vs 78 [0·4%] of 21?406; odds ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·52–1·20, p=0·27).\n\n There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes between the two groups in patients who developed active SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n For all patients in the study, overall mortality was lower in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the group of patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (odds ratio 0·70, 95% CI 0·55–0·89, p=0·0031).\n\n In multivariate logistic regression analysis, receipt of hydroxychloroquine was not associated with the development of active SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·51–1·42).\n\n\nInterpretation\nHydroxychloroquine was not associated with a preventive effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large group of patients with rheumatological conditions.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7505552","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chris

We compared published clinical data for COVID-19 with clinical features of other hyperinflammatory or cytokine storm syndromes.\n\n Based on a framework of conserved clinical characteristics, we developed a six-criterion additive scale for cHIS: fever, macrophage activation (hyperferritinaemia), haematological dysfunction (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio), hepatic injury (lactate dehydrogenase or asparate aminotransferase), coagulopathy (D-dimer), and cytokinaemia (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, or triglycerides).\n\n We then validated the association of the cHIS scale with in-hospital mortality and need for mechanical ventilation in consecutive patients in the Intermountain Prospective Observational COVID-19 (IPOC) registry who were admitted to hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. We used a multistate model to estimate the temporal implications of cHIS.\n\n\nFindings\nWe included 299 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between March 13 and May 5, 2020, in analyses.\n\n Unadjusted discrimination of the maximum daily cHIS score was 0·81 (95% CI 0·74–0·88) for in-hospital mortality and 0·92 (0·88–0·96) for mechanical ventilation; these results remained significant in multivariable analysis (odds ratio 1·6 [95% CI 1·2–2·1], p=0·0020, for mortality and 4·3 [3·0–6·0], p&lt;0·0001, for mechanical ventilation).\n\n 161 (54%) of 299 patients met two or more cHIS criteria during their hospital admission; these patients had higher risk of mortality than patients with a score of less than 2 (24 [15%] of 138 vs one [1%] of 161) and for mechanical ventilation (73 [45%] vs three [2%]).\n\n In the multistate model, using daily cHIS score as a time-dependent variable, the cHIS hazard ratio for worsening from low to moderate oxygen requirement was 1·4 (95% CI 1·2–1·6), from moderate oxygen to high-flow oxygen 2·2 (1·1–4·4), and to mechanical ventilation 4·0 (1·9–8·2).\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe proposed and validated criteria for hyperinflammation in COVID-19. This hyperinflammatory state, cHIS, is commonly associated with progression to mechanical ventilation and death.\n\n External validation is needed.\n\n The cHIS scale might be helpful in defining target populations for trials and immunomodulatory therapies.\n\n\nFunding\nIntermountain Research and Medical Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7524533","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Brandon J","surname":"Webb","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ithan D","surname":"Peltan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Jensen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daanish","surname":"Hoda","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bradley","surname":"Hunter","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aaron","surname":"Silver","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nathan","surname":"Starr","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Whitney","surname":"Buckel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Grisel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erika","surname":"Hummel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gregory","surname":"Snow","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dave","surname":"Morris","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eddie","surname":"Stenehjem","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rajendu","surname":"Srivastava","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Samuel M","surname":"Brown","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41590-020-00814-z","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Extrafollicular B cell responses correlate with neutralizing antibodies and morbidity in COVID-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30146-8","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The effect of frailty on survival in patients with COVID-19 (COPE): a multicentre, European, observational cohort study","abstract":"Background\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on health-care systems.\n\n Frailty is being used in clinical decision making for patients with COVID-19, yet the prevalence and effect of frailty in people with COVID-19 is not known.\n\n In the COVID-19 in Older PEople (COPE) study we aimed to establish the prevalence of frailty in patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital and investigate its association with mortality and duration of hospital stay.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was an observational cohort study conducted at ten hospitals in the UK and one in Italy.\n\n All adults (?18 years) admitted to participating hospitals with COVID-19 were included.\n\n Patients with incomplete hospital records were excluded.\n\n The study analysed routinely generated hospital data for patients with COVID-19.

Patient characteristics were compared between two periods (before/after March 19th) considering French guidelines.\n\n The aim of the study was to evaluate how medical care impacted unfavorable outcome, namely admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and/or death.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 132 patients were admitted: mean age 59.0±16.3 years; mean C-reactive protein (CRP) level 84.0±71.1 mg/L; 46% had a lymphocyte count &lt;1000/mm3.\n\n Prescribed anti-infective agents were lopinavir-ritonavir (n=12), azithromycin (AZI) (n=28) and AZI combined with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (n=52).\n\n There was a significant decrease in ICU admission, from 43% to 12%, between the two periods (P&lt;0.0001).\n\n Delays until transfer to ICU were similar between periods (P=0.86).\n\n Pulmonary computerized tomography (CT)-scans were performed significantly more often with time (from 50% to 90%, P&lt;0.0001), and oxygen-dependency (53% vs 80%, P=0.001) and prescription of AZI±HCQ (from 25% to 76%, P&lt;0.0001) were also greater over time.\n\n Multivariate analyses showed a reduction of unfavorable outcome in patients receiving AZI±HCQ (hazard ratio [HR]=0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI: 0.21-0.97], P=0.04), particularly among an identified category of individuals (lymphocyte ?1000/mm3 or CRP ?100 mg/L).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe present study showed a significant decrease in admission to ICU over time, which was probably related to multiple factors, including a better indication of pulmonary CT-scan, oxygen therapy, and a suitable prescription of anti-infective agents.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7396133","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd and International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.","authors":[{"firstname":"Benjamin","surname":"Davido","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ghilas","surname":"Boussaid","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Isabelle","surname":"Vaugier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thibaud","surname":"Lansaman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frédérique","surname":"Bouchand","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Lawrence","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Claude","surname":"Alvarez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Moine","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Véronique","surname":"Perronne","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frédéric","surname":"Barbot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Azzam","surname":"Saleh-Mghir","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Perronne","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Djillali","surname":"Annane","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"De Truchis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101663","date":"2020-04-04","title":"Clinical and microbiological effect of a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 80 COVID-19 patients with at least a six-day follow up: A pilot observational study","abstract":"Background\nWe need an effective treatment to cure COVID-19 patients and to decrease virus carriage duration.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an uncontrolled, non-comparative, observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU).\n\n\nResults\nAll patients improved clinically except one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year-old patient still in intensive care.\n\n A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8.

in adults with severe COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial","abstract":"Background\nNo specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China.\n\n Eligible patients were adults (aged ?18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2–10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days.\n\n Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir–ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids.\n\n The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first.\n\n Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04257656.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population.\n\n Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87–1·75]).\n\n Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95–2·43]).\n\n Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients.\n\n Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits.\n\n However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences

However, the results of this study do not support its use in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who require oxygen.\nIntroduction\nThe World Health Organization declared pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is resulting in fatal pneumonia. Treatments are urgently needed to prevent hypoxaemic respiratory failure and death. Hydroxychloroquine has received worldwide attention after an in vitro study reported its potential activity against SARS-CoV-2, and small studies have released promising results. However, the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for treating covid-19 is the subject of serious debate. One uncontrolled French study included 26 hospital inpatients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on a nasopharyngeal swab. The study suggested that 600 mg/day of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 shedding and when combined with azithromycin it was more efficacious. However, another uncontrolled French study found no evidence of antiviral clearance with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 11 patients admitted to hospital. A recent study randomised 62 patients into two parallel groups: a control group and a group receiving hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/day for five days). The study reported a shorter time to clinical recovery in the hydroxychloroquine group. However, these patients were not severely ill, the clinical endpoints were not clearly defined, and there was no stratification for comorbidities known to be associated with a poor outcome. \nBased on the results of these studies and the negligible cost and known safety profile of hydroxychloroquine in treating rheumatic conditions, this drug has been considered to be potentially useful in treating patients with covid-19. Hydroxychloroquine has attracted attention in social and mass media, and has also received US Food and Drug Administration approval for patients with severe covid-19. However, fears have increased about a shortage of this essential treatment for patients with rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematus, and questions have been raised about its safety in patients with covid-19.\nBecause of the lack of unbiased data and the urgency of determining the clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to treat covid-19, we used observational data collected in a real world setting in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who required oxygen. We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of oral hydroxychloroquine at a daily dose of 600 mg on admissions to the intensive care unit or death by any cause. Secondary outcomes included the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in reducing the duration of oxygen requirement.\nMethods\nStudy design and population\nWe used data collected from routine care to assess the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 and who required oxygen. Physicians screened the electronic health records of all patients with covid-19 pneumonia admitted to four French tertiary hospitals between 12 March and 31 March 2020. Patients were eligible for this study if they were aged 18-80 years, had PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (supplementary data 1), and required oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (corresponding to a WHO progression score of 5).\nExclusion criteria were the presence of a contraindication to hydroxychloroquine at 600 mg/day (including patients receiving dialysis); hydroxychloroquine treatment started before admission to hospital; treatment with another experimental drug for covid-19 (tocilizumab, lopinavir-ritonavir, or remdesivir) within 48 hours after admission; organ failure that required immediate admission to the intensive care unit or continuous care unit; acute respiratory distress syndrome at admission (defined by the need for non-invasive ventilation with provision of continuous positive airway pressure or invasive mechanical ventilation); discharge from the intensive care unit to standard care; decision to limit and stop active treatments prescribed at admission; and opposition to data collection by patients or their legal representative.\nThe study was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki, as amended, and received approval by the appropriate IRB, which included an amendment for the extension of follow-up (No 2020_060, Hopitaux Universitaires Henri-Mondor, AP-HP).\nTreatment strategies\nWe compared two treatment strategies: starting hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg/day (treatment group) and no hydroxychloroquine treatment (control group). The dose was chosen after publication of the first study on hydroxychloroquine for treating covid-19. Patients in the treatment group could start treatment within a grace period of 48 hours after admission. The decision of whether or not to treat patients with hydroxychloroquine was based on local medical consensus and the clinicians' own opinion of its effectiveness. The decision was made before patients were admitted to hospital and so their characteristics played no part. Supplementary data 1 provides additional information about the number of patients in each group in each hospital.\nStart and end of follow-up\nThe start of follow-up (baseline or time zero) for each patient was the time of admission to hospital. All patients were followed up from baseline until death, loss to follow-up, or end of follow-up on 24 April 2020, whichever occurred first.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was survival without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21. Secondary outcomes were overall survival, survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome, weaning from oxygen, and discharge from hospital to home or rehabilitation (all at day 21). Patients who received hydroxychloroquine had QT prolongation assessed by a 12 lead electrocardiogram and corrected for heart rate by Bazett's or Fredericia's formula at the start of treatment and for three to five days after.\nStatistical analysis\nAn inverse probability of treatment weighting approach was used to balance the differences in baseline variables between treatment groups.  A non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to estimate each patient's probability of receiving hydroxychloroquine given their baseline covariates (that is, the propensity score). Variables of the propensity score model were planned and prespecified before outcome analyses. Several variables were included: age, sex, comorbidities (presence of chronic respiratory insufficiency during oxygen treatment, or asthma, cystic fibrosis, or any chronic respiratory disease likely to result in decompensation during a viral infection; heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV); chronic kidney disease; liver cirrhosis with Child-Pugh class B or more; personal history of cardiovascular disease (hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, or cardiac surgery); insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, or diabetic microangiopathy or macroangiopathy; treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, including anticancer chemotherapy; uncontrolled HIV infection or HIV infection with CD4 cell counts &lt;200/microL; or a haematological malignancy); body mass index (&gt;=30 or not); third trimester of pregnancy; treatment by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers; time since symptom onset; and severity of condition at admission (percentage of lung affected: &gt;=50% or not; presence of confusion; respiratory frequency; oxygen saturation without oxygen; oxygen flow; systolic blood pressure; and C reactive protein level).\nAll variables included in the propensity score model reflected knowledge available at baseline. Standardised differences were examined to assess balance, with a threshold of 10% designated to indicate clinically meaningful imbalance. \nCrude survival rates were computed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute inverse probability of treatment weighting hazard ratios. Inverse probability of treatment weighting estimates of the relative risk were computed for binary outcomes. Outcomes are presented in the total population and in the subgroup of patients with a better prognosis at admission, estimated by a quick sepsis related organ failure assessment score less than 2.  \nOur causal contrast of interest was the per protocol effect, and we compared participants who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission with those who did not receive the drug. Because some patients subsequently received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours, we specified two additional comparisons. Firstly, mimicking an intention-to-treat analysis: all patients eligible for the study were analysed, and those who received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours were analysed in the control group. Secondly, mimicking an as-treated analysis: patients who received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours were analysed in the treatment group.\nWe performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings. Firstly, we conducted a trimmed analysis that was truncated at the region of common support, defined as the overlap between the range of propensity scores in the treatment group and the control group. Patients with propensity scores outside the region of common support were excluded from this analysis. Secondly, to account for time dependent bias, we performed an analysis in which all patients from the control group who reached the primary outcome (transfer to intensive care unit or death) during the grace period were randomly assigned to one of the two groups, given that their observational data were compatible with both groups at the time of the event. \nMissing baseline variables were handled by multiple imputation by chained equations using the other variables available. All statistical analyses were performed with the R statistical package version 3.6.1 or later (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, https://www.R-project.org/).\nPatient and public involvement\nNeither patients nor the public were involved in the conception or conduct of the study.\nResults\nAmong the 181 patients eligible for analysis, 84 received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission, eight received hydroxychloroquine more than 48 hours after admission, and 89 did not receive hydroxychloroquine (fig 1). To assess a per protocol effect, our main analysis compared the 84 participants who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours (treatment group) with the 89 who did not receive the drug (control group). The median age of patients was 60 years (interquartile range 52-68 years), and 72% were men. Patients in the treatment group had fewer comorbidities, except for liver cirrhosis. The median interval between symptom onset and admission to hospital was 7 days (interquartile range 5-10 days). Overall, initial severity was well balanced between the groups, except for confusion on admission (0 in the treatment group v 6 (7%) in the control group). Azithromycin was administered to 18% of the participants in the treatment group versus 29% in the control group; amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was given to 52% versus 28%, respectively (excluding cointerventions in patients transferred to the intensive care unit; table 1). No patients received antiviral or anti-inflammatory treatments, including steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not used as antipyretics in adults in France and are considered to be contraindicated for covid-19) before transfer to the intensive care unit.

After inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied, 15 of the 19 covariates in the planned propensity score had weighted standardised differences below 10%; four covariates (confusion on admission, chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV), and liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B or more)) exceeded the threshold (supplementary data 3). These results were owing to the absence of confusion on admission in the treatment group (compared with six patients with confusion in the control group); only one patient had chronic kidney disease in the treatment group (compared with eight in the control group); only one patient had chronic heart failure in the treatment group (compared with five in the control group); and only one patient had liver cirrhosis in the treatment group (compared with no patients in the control group). These four variables were therefore not included in the final propensity score model (supplementary data 4).\nFollow-up and outcomes\nMedian follow-up for surviving patients was 32.5 days; three patients (one in the treatment group and two in the control group; 2%) were lost to follow-up after being discharged in good health and without oxygen. Two other patients had a follow-up of only 20 days. At day 21, 17 of 173 (10%) patients had died (nine in the treatment group and eight in the control group).\nIn the non-weighted analyses, among the 173 patients in the two treatment groups, the rate of survival without transfer to intensive care at 21 days was 80% in the treatment group compared with 75% in the control group (hazard ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 1.5; fig 2). The overall survival rate at 21 days was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.5 to 3.0).

A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to estimate each patient's probability of receiving hydroxychloroquine given their baseline covariates (that is, the propensity score: variables in model included age, sex, and comorbidities)\nAt day 21, 79% of patients in the treatment group had been weaned from oxygen compared with 74% in the control group (relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3). Furthermore, 80% of patients in both groups had been discharged to home or rehabilitation (1.0, 0.9 to 1.2; table 2). None of the 15 patients who received a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was transferred to intensive care and none died. Additionally, these patients had fewer severe signs at admission compared with patients who received hydroxychloroquine without azithromycin (oxygen flow: 2 L/min, interquartile range 1.25-4 v 3 L/min, 2-6; respiratory frequency: 25 per min, interquartile range 22-33 v 28 per min, 24-32; percentage of lung affected &gt;50%: 13% v 17%). Finally, 26 patients received azithromycin without hydroxychloroquine. Among these patients, six were admitted to the intensive care unit and five died. \nIn the inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses that took imbalance at baseline into account, among the 173 patients in the two groups, the survival rate without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21 was 76% in the treatment group and 75% in the control group (weighted hazard ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1; fig 2). The overall survival rate at day 21 was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.4 to 3.3). The rate of survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 was 69% in the treatment group compared with 74% in the control group (1.3, 0.7 to 2.6; table 2, supplementary data 5 and 6).\nAt day 21, 82% of patients in the treatment group had been weaned from oxygen compared with 76% in the control group (weighted relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3). Furthermore, 76% of patients in the treatment group had been discharged to home or rehabilitation compared with 82% in the control group (0.9, 0.8 to 1.2; table 2). All sensitivity analyses were consistent with the principal analysis and found that hydroxychloroquine had no effect on any outcome (supplementary data 7).\nOur results also suggested that patients with fewer symptoms and better prognosis at admission did not respond to hydroxychloroquine (quick sepsis related organ failure assessment score less than 2: n=73 in the treatment group and n=76 in the control group): weighted hazard ratio 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 2.6) for survival without transfer to intensive care unit; weighted hazard ratio 1.8 (0.6 to 5.9) for overall survival; weighted hazard ratio 1.6 (0.7 to 3.3) for survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome; weighted relative risk 1.0 (0.9 to 1.2) for oxygen weaning; weighted relative risk 0.9 (0.7 to 1.1) for discharge to home or rehabilitation.\nFinally, adding the eight patients who received hydroxychloroquine treatment more than 48 hours after admission (for a population of 181) and including them in the treatment group (mimicking an as-treated analysis) or in the control group (mimicking an intention-to-treat analysis) did not change the results (weighted hazard ratio 1.0 (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1), and 0.9 (0.5 to 1.9) for the primary outcome, respectively; supplementary data 8 and 9).\nSafety\nOf the 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine within the first 48 hours, eight (10%) experienced electrocardiographic modifications that required discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine at a median of 4 days (interquartile range 3-9 days) after it began, which is in accordance with French national guidelines. Among these patients, seven had a corrected QT interval prolongation of more than 60 ms (including one patient with corrected QT interval prolongation &gt;500 ms). One patient who received no other drugs that might have interfered with cardiac conduction presented a first degree atrioventricular block after two days of hydroxychloroquine treatment. One patient in whom hydroxychloroquine was started five days after admission (control group) was transferred to intensive care two days later. This patient was then prescribed lopinavir and ritonavir and developed left bundle branch block on day 8. None of these patients was concomitantly treated with azithromycin.\nDiscussion\nWe report a comparative study that uses real world data collected from routine care to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in a population of 181 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 hypoxaemic pneumonia. We found that hydroxychloroquine treatment at 600 mg/day added to standard care was not associated with a reduction of admissions to the intensive care unit or death 21 days after hospital admission compared with standard care alone. Additionally the rate of survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome did not increase. These results were unchanged when the eight patients who received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours were included in the analysis, regardless of whether they were analysed in the treatment group (mimicking an as-treated analysis) or in the standard of care (control) group (mimicking an intention-to-treat analysis).\nOur population of patients admitted to hospital because they required oxygen is similar to that reported by other studies, and the proportion of patients transferred to the intensive care unit was similar to that reported in a Chinese cohort of 138 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 pneumonia. The clinical features of included patients were also consistent with other reports, with a predominance of men and patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or obesity.  Apart from azithromycin, the patients in this study did not receive any other drugs; in particular, potential confounders such as antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments, including steroids, before admission to intensive care.\nIt could be argued that the timing of antiviral treatment initiation might be critical in reducing SARS-Cov-2 viral load. In the recent lopinavir-ritonavir trial, a post hoc subgroup analysis suggested that lopinavir-ritonavir might have a clinical benefit when started earlier than 12 days after symptom onset. In our study, however, patients had a short median time from symptom onset to inclusion (seven days) and were treated with hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission. We also found that viral ribonucleic acid for SARS-CoV-2 was detectable among all patients at inclusion, showing active viral shedding. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that hydroxychloroquine could be beneficial at symptom onset; this question must be assessed in future trials.\nA previous report indicates that hydroxychloroquine should have been expected to show some antiviral efficacy. We did not check the results of subsequent SARS-Cov-2 PCR in this study and therefore cannot reach a conclusion about its potential efficacy for decreasing viral shedding. Although this might seem to be a limitation, we used robust clinical outcomes; that is, death, admission to the intensive care unit, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and oxygen requirement, which are substantially more clinically relevant.\nProgression of covid-19 pneumonia in the second week of illness is associated with a so called cytokine storm,  which is thought to be responsible for the clinical worsening of many patients. Most of the patients included in this study had an inflammatory syndrome defined by a C reactive protein level higher than 40 mg/L, which suggests that a cytokine storm syndrome had already begun. Therefore, drugs that decrease virus shedding could be inadequate at this stage, which is why many anti-inflammatory drugs are currently being tested, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids. However, hydroxychloroquine could still be effective in this setting because of its immunomodulatory properties, which include regulation of the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 2, interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and tumour necrosis factor alpha, and endosomal inhibition of toll-like receptors, which have a major role in innate immune response. Nonetheless, hydroxychloroquine treatment showed no effectiveness in this specific population.\nFinally, hydroxychloroquine blocks the KCNH2 encoded hERG/Kv11.1 potassium channel and can potentially prolong the corrected QT interval, with potentially severe consequences, such as sudden cardiac death and cardiac arrhythmia in patients with covid-19. In addition to prolongations of corrected QT intervals, we observed two other major cardiac events in this study, and the French national drug agency has reported three deaths potentially related to hydroxychloroquine since its promotion as a potential treatment for covid-19. Although hydroxychloroquine is considered safe in the context of systemic lupus erythematosus, these adverse events might be explained by the use of high dose hydroxychloroquine in patients older than 75 years with renal impairment and frequent drug interactions. We cannot rule out the possibility that these cardiac effects attributed to hydroxychloroquine were caused by covid-19, especially given electrocardiograms were unavailable during follow-up in the control group. However, these possible side effects of hydroxychloroquine plus the negative clinical results of this study argue against the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 pneumonia.\nLimitations of this study\nOur study has several limitations. Firstly, although we used robust methods and statistical techniques to draw causal inferences from observational data, treatment was not randomly assigned and potential unmeasured confounders could bias our results. Secondly, four potentially important prognostic variables could not be balanced in the propensity score model because none or only one patient in the treatment group presented with these variables. Accordingly, caution is required in interpreting these results, especially for overall mortality for which only a few events were observed. Nevertheless, this limitation did favour the hydroxychloroquine group and the absence of any difference between treated and untreated patients further strengthens our conclusions. Thirdly, we did not take a centre effect into account in the propensity score model because the number of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine in centres was unbalanced (some centres treated all their patients, whereas others did not). Nevertheless, that the decision to treat or not treat patients with hydroxychloroquine was based on local medical consensus rather than on their characteristics should reduce this bias. Fourthly, our sample was limited to the number of eligible patients available at the time of analysis; we cannot rule out the possibility that our findings are owing to a lack of power. Fifthly, because we included only patients admitted to hospital, we cannot reach a conclusion about the possible efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in preventing covid-19 or in preventing severe forms of the disease. Finally, our study was not designed to assess the efficacy of the association of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and no conclusion about its efficacy can be reached. Further research is ongoing.\nConclusions\nIn patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 pneumonia who require oxygen, hydroxychloroquine treatment seemed to have no effect on reducing admissions to intensive care or deaths at day 21 after hospital admission. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine treatment did not have any effect on survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 after hospital admission. These results do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine in these patients.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nTreatments are urgently needed to prevent respiratory failure and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19)\nAn in vitro study has reported potential activity by hydroxychloroquine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for covid-19\nSmall studies of hydroxychloroquine treatment in patients with covid-19 have reported promising results\nWhat this study adds\nIn patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 pneumonia who require oxygen, hydroxychloroquine seemed to have no effect on reducing admissions to intensive care or deaths at day 21 after hospital admission\nHydroxychloroquine treatment did not have any effect on survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 after hospital admission\nThe results of this study do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine in these patients\nExtra material supplied by authors\nContributors: VTT and MR contributed equally to the work.

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.\n\n We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine

when using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score to estimate causal treatment effects in observational studies","abstract":"id='sim6607-para-0001'>The propensity score is defined as a subject's probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates.\n Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates.\n Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects.\n However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment.\n We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups.\n We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample.\n The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher?order moments, and interactions.\n The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample.\n Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study.\n We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of ‘best practice’ when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data.\n © 2015 The Authors.\n

We also conducted a trial sequential analysis to indicate the possibility of type I or II errors and calculate the information size.\n Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE) was applying to assess the certainty of evidence at the primary outcome level.\n Results.\n Twenty-one RCTs were identified and analyzed.\n Patients treated with corticosteroid had a 7% reduction in relative risk in 28-day all-cause mortality compared to controls (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99).\n However, there were no significant differences for the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09) or in-hospital mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11).\n Corticosteroids shortened the length of ICU stay by 1.04 days (RR -1.04, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.36) and the length of hospital stay by 2.49 days (RR -2.49, 95% CI -4.96 to -0.02).\n Corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16) but not gastroduodenal bleeding (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.37) or superinfection (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.15).\n However, some date on secondary outcomes were unavailable because they were not measured or not reported in the included studies which may cause a lack of power or selective outcome reporting.\n The information size was calculated at 10044 patients.\n Trial sequential analysis showed that the meta-analysis was conclusive and the risk of type 2 error was minimal.\n What Is New and Conclusion.\n Corticosteroids are likely to be effective in reducing 28-day mortality and attenuating septic shock without increasing the rate of life-threatening complications.\n TSA showed that the risk of type II error in this meta-analysis was minimal and the result was conclusive.\n","id":"PMC6590573","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"X.-J.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.-Z.","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-S.","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-X.","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Z.-Z.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T.-H.","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.-C.","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-H.","surname":"Liu","email":"lyh0718@126.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajem.2018.11.040","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Can corticosteroids reduce the mortality of patients with severe sepsis?

of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates.\n Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates.\n Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects.\n However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment.\n We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups.\n We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample.\n The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher?order moments, and interactions.\n The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample.\n Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study.\n We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute

that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates.\n The other estimators resulted in biased

(2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47%

Trial of Lopinavir–Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug

Various agents were initially proclaimed to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are all examples of therapeutic agents, whose efficacy against COVID-19 was later disproved.\n Meanwhile, concentrated efforts of researchers and clinicians worldwide have led to the identification of novel therapeutic options to control the disease including PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332).\n Although COVID-19 cases are currently treated using a comprehensive approach of anticoagulants, oxygen, and antibiotics, the novel Pfizer agent PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332), an investigational COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate, significantly reduced hospitalization time and death rates, based on an interim analysis of the phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness.\n The scheduled interim analysis demonstrated an 89 % reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint).\n However, there still exists a great need for the development of additional treatments, as the recommended therapeutic options are insufficient in many cases.\n Thus far, mRNA and vector vaccines appear to be the most effective modalities to control the pandemic.\n In the current review, we provide an update on the progress that has been made since April 2020 in clinical trials concerning the effectiveness of therapies available to combat COVID-19.

(RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","abstract":"Background\nCasirivimab and imdevimab are non-competing monoclonal antibodies that bind to two different sites on the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, blocking viral entry into host cells.\n\n We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of casirivimab and imdevimab administered in combination in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nRECOVERY is a randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial comparing several possible treatments with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 127 UK hospitals took part in the evaluation of casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n Eligible participants were any patients aged at least 12 years admitted to hospital with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone or usual care plus casirivimab 4 g and imdevimab 4 g administered together in a single intravenous infusion.\n\n Investigators and data assessors were masked to analyses of the outcome data during the trial.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality assessed by intention to treat, first only in patients without detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection at randomisation (ie, those who were seronegative) and then in the overall population.\n\n Safety was assessed in all participants who received casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov (NCT04381936).\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Sept 18, 2020, and May 22, 2021, 9785 patients enrolled in RECOVERY were eligible for casirivimab and imdevimab, of which 4839 were randomly assigned to casirivimab and imdevimab plus usual care and 4946 to usual care alone.\n\n 3153 (32%) of 9785 patients were seronegative, 5272 (54%) were seropositive, and 1360 (14%) had unknown baseline antibody status.\n\n 812 (8%) patients were known to have received at least one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\n In the primary efficacy population of seronegative patients, 396 (24%) of 1633 patients allocated to casirivimab and imdevimab versus 452 (30%) of 1520 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 0·79, 95% CI 0·69–0·91; p=0·0009).\n\n In an analysis of all randomly assigned patients (regardless of baseline antibody status), 943 (19%) of 4839 patients allocated to casirivimab and imdevimab versus 1029 (21%) of 4946 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (RR 0·94, 95% CI 0·86–1·02; p=0·14).\n\n The proportional effect of casirivimab and imdevimab on mortality differed significantly between seropositive and seronegative patients (p value for heterogeneity=0·002).\n\n There were no deaths attributed to the treatment, or meaningful between-group differences in the pre-specified safety outcomes of cause-specific mortality, cardiac arrhythmia, thrombosis, or major bleeding events.\n\n Serious adverse reactions reported in seven (&lt;1%) participants were believed by the local investigator to be related to treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, the monoclonal antibody combination of casirivimab and imdevimab reduced 28-day mortality in patients who were seronegative (and therefore had not mounted their own humoral immune response) at baseline but not in those who were seropositive at baseline.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Research and Innovation

antibodies","abstract":"id='Par1'>The SARS-CoV-2 B.\n1.1.529 (Omicron) variant contains 15 mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD).\n How Omicron evades RBD-targeted neutralizing antibodies requires immediate investigation.\n Here we use high-throughput yeast display screening1,2 to determine the profiles of RBD escaping mutations for 247 human anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies and show that the neutralizing antibodies can be classified by unsupervised clustering into six epitope groups (A–F)—a grouping that is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications3–5.\n Various single mutations of Omicron can impair neutralizing antibodies of different epitope groups.\n Specifically, neutralizing antibodies in groups A–D, the epitopes of which overlap with the ACE2-binding motif, are largely escaped by K417N, G446S, E484A and Q493R.\n Antibodies in group E (for example, S309)6 and group F (for example, CR3022)7, which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but a subset of neutralizing antibodies are still escaped by G339D, N440K and S371L.\n Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could also be escaped, owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes.\n In total, over 85% of the tested neutralizing antibodies were escaped by Omicron.\n With regard to neutralizing-antibody-based drugs, the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10933, REGN10987, AZD1061, AZD8895 and BRII-196 was greatly undermined by Omicron, whereas VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still functioned at a reduced efficacy.\n Together, our data suggest that infection with Omicron would result in considerable humoral immune evasion, and that neutralizing antibodies targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region will remain most effective.\n Our results inform the development of antibody-based drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants.\n","id":"PMC8866119","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

to facilitate its infection.\n Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification.\n Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment.\n Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice.\n Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient.\n Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab.\n Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis.\n Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.","id":"PMC7714896","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

of a novel human CD147 knock-in NSG mouse model to test SARS-CoV-2 viral infection","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>An animal model that can mimic the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is critical to understanding the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and for development of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat emerging mutants.\n\n Studies show that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry.\n\n Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which are clearly invaluable.\n\n However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: (1) low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients; (2) low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients; and (3) hACE2Tg mice do not mimic the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.\n\n Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronavirus infection is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a possible co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry.\n\n It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par2'>Here we successfully generated a hCD147 knock-in mouse model (hCD147KI) in the NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG) background.\n\n In this hCD147KI-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed downstream of the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of hCD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 (JAX) model.\n\n In addition, the hCD147KI-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations in immunosuppressed states.\n\n Our data show (1) the human CD147 protein is expressed in various organs (including bronchiolar epithelial cells) in hCD147KI-NSG mice by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry; (2) hCD147KI-NSG mice are marginally sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to WT-NSG littermates characterized by increased viral copies by qRT-PCR and moderate body weight decline compared to baseline; (3) a significant increase in leukocytes in the lungs of hCD147KI-NSG mice, compared to infected WT-NSG mice.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par3'>hCD147KI-NSG mice are more sensitive to COVID-19 infection compared to WT-NSG mice.\n\n The hCD147KI-NSG mouse model can serve as an additional animal model for further interrogation whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at

humanized CD147 transgenic mice were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and its two variants, alpha and beta.\n When infected, these mice developed exudative alveolar pneumonia, featured by immune responses involving alveoli-infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes and activation of IL-17 signaling pathway.\n Mechanistically, we proposed that severe COVID-19-related cytokine storm is induced by a “spike protein-CD147-CyPA signaling axis”: Infection of SARS-CoV-2 through CD147 initiated the JAK-STAT pathway, which further induced expression of cyclophilin A (CyPA); CyPA reciprocally bound to CD147 and triggered MAPK pathway.\n Consequently, the MAPK pathway regulated the expression of cytokines and chemokines, which promoted the development of cytokine storm.\n Importantly, Meplazumab

symptomatic and for activating public health measures.\n Antigen rapid detection tests detect viral proteins and, although they are less sensitive than molecular tests, have the advantages of being easier to do, giving a faster time to result, of being lower cost, and able to detect infection in those who are most likely to be at risk of transmitting the virus to others.\n Antigen rapid detection tests can be used as a public health tool for screening individuals at enhanced risk of infection, to protect people who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure safe travel and the resumption of schooling and social activities, and to enable economic recovery.\n With vaccine roll-out, antibody tests (which detect the host's response to infection or vaccination) can be useful surveillance tools to inform public policy, but should not be used to provide proof of immunity, as the correlates of protection remain unclear.\n All three types of COVID-19 test continue to have a crucial role

17-year-old male with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) secondary to COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nCase report\nThis patient presented with cough, sore throat, anorexia and pyrexia.\n\n On examination, he had gross cervical lymphadenopathy and palpable splenomegaly.\n\n Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels.\n\n The patient's H-Score [2] was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 93–96%.\n\n Considering Russell and colleagues' [3] comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with COVID-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\n\nResults\nThe patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24?h.\n\n His lymph nodes and spleen began to normalise after the first 48?h, at which time point the ferritin also started to decrease.\n\n He was discharged after 11?days feeling fit and well.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis case certainly illustrates the importance of hyperinflammation syndromes in COVID-19. It also raises the question – is the severe pneumonitis seen in patients with COVID-19 an immunological phenomenon? We know that the viral load of patients with COVID-19 seems to peak in the early stages of illness [4,5]; however, patients deteriorate later in the disease course, at around days 10–14. This patient, who had risk factors for deterioration (male, pancytopaenic), did not develop an oxygen requirement and clinically and biochemically improved rapidly on Anakinra with no adverse events.\n\n We might suggest Anakinra to the scientific community as a treatment option in COVID-19 infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7245680","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Author(s).

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Province.\n\n The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020.\nMethods\nIn this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs.\n\n We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge.\n\n All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done.\n\n\nFindings\nThe patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma.\n\n The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020.\nInterpretation\nWe illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy.\n\n We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.\n\n\nFunding\nREACTing (Research &amp; Action Emerging Infectious Diseases).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7156120","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Francois-Xavier","surname":"Lescure","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lila","surname":"Bouadma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Duc","surname":"Nguyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marion","surname":"Parisey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul-Henri","surname":"Wicky","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sylvie","surname":"Behillil","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexandre","surname":"Gaymard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maude","surname":"Bouscambert-Duchamp","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Flora","surname":"Donati","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Quentin","surname":"Le Hingrat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincent","surname":"Enouf","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nadhira","surname":"Houhou-Fidouh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martine","surname":"Valette","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandra","surname":"Mailles","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jean-Christophe","surname":"Lucet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"France","surname":"Mentre","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"Duval","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Diane","surname":"Descamps","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Denis","surname":"Malvy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jean-François","surname":"Timsit","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Lina","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sylvie","surname":"van-der-Werf","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yazdan","surname":"Yazdanpanah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

Given the known side effects of these drugs, there is an urgent need to evaluate their effectiveness in COVID-19. In this nationwide retrospective study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the US Veterans Health Administration, the authors found that treatment with hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, did not reduce the risk of ventilation or death compared to no hydroxychloroquine use. While we await the results of ongoing randomized clinical trials, these results suggest that hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, may not be beneficial for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. These results do not provide insight into outpatient use of these drugs.\nIn this nationwide retrospective analysis of 807 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, Magagnoli et al. report that, after adjusting for several COVID-19-relevant clinical and demographic characteristics, hydroxychloroquine use, with or without azithromycin, did not improve mortality or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation compared to no hydroxychloroquine use.\nIntroduction\nThe rapidity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced COVID-19 pandemic has exerted inordinate pressure on clinicians and drug-regulatory agencies throughout the world to expedite development, approval, and deployment of both experimental drugs and repurposing of existing therapeutics. Among the myriad therapeutics advanced as potential repurposing candidates for COVID-19, the antimalarial and immunomodulatory drug hydroxychloroquine has captured great attention. Following the release of initial positive results of hydroxychloroquine in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro  and a small open-label, non-randomized, single treatment center study that reported efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and a potential synergistic effect with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin in improving viral clearance in COVID-19 patients, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) used its emergency authority to permit the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 when clinical trials are unavailable or infeasible. However, subsequent studies have not identified a similar benefit of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19, and others have demonstrated potentially severe toxicities associated with its use. \nThe urgency in obtaining definitive information about the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 triggered an explosion in the number of registered clinical trials testing a variety of regimens and enrolling more than 75,000 patients in North America alone. Given the great and immediate need for insights into the clinical outcomes among patients currently treated with hydroxychloroquine, we conducted a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Veterans Health Administration medical centers across the United States to analyze the associations between hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use and clinical outcomes. The findings of this study of one of the most complete national datasets in the United States can accelerate our understanding of the outcomes of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 while we await the results of the ongoing prospective trials.\nResults\nBaseline Characteristics in the Full Study Cohort of 807 Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients\nCharacteristics	HC (n = 198)	HC+AZ (n = 214)	No HC (n = 395)	p Value	 	Age, median (IQR), range, y	71 (62-76.8), 27-99	68 (59-74), 28-95	70 (59-77), 22-99	0.02	 		 	Race, No. (%)	 		 	 Black	124 (62.6)	127 (59.4)	222 (56.2)	0.54	 	 White	61 (30.8)	76 (35.5)	149 (37.7)	 	 Other/unknown	13 (6.6)	11 (5.1)	24 (6.1)	 		 	Sex, No. (%)	 		 	 Female	6 (3.0)	10 (4.7)	19 (4.8)	0.58	 	 Male	192 (97.0)	204 (95.3)	376 (95.2)	 	Body mass index, median (IQR), kg/m2	30.2 (25.1-33.7)	30.4 (25.9-35.2)	28.8 (25.3-33.3)	0.09	 	Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, no.

The baseline demographics, comedications, comorbidities, and clinical and laboratory characteristics are presented in Table 1 . The median ages in years (range) were 71 (27-99), 68 (28-95), and 70 (22-99) in the hydroxychloroquine (HC), HC with azithromycin (HC+AZ), and the no HC groups, respectively. In this cohort of 807 patients, 121 (15%) and 67 (8.3%) patients were taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, respectively. Cardiovascular comorbidities, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes were present in 346 (43%), 175 (21.7%), and 534 (66%) of the patients, respectively, and these and other comorbidities were also comparable among the treatment groups. The oxygen saturation was below 94% in 33.6%, alanine aminotransferase was &gt;40 U/L in 24.8%, and D-dimer was &gt;1,000 ng/mL in 22.9% of the patients, and these laboratory values at baseline were significantly different among the treatment groups, with HC and HC+AZ groups having more patients with elevated hepatic enzymes and inflammatory markers.\nDistribution of Treatment Cohorts in the Full Study Cohort of 807 Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients\nAZ, azithromycin; CI, confidence interval; HC, hydroxychloroquine;\nAmong the 807 patients, 198 (24.5%) and 214 (26.5%) patients were treated with HC and HC+AZ, respectively, although 395 (49.0%) patients did not receive HC at any time during their hospitalization (Figure 1 ). Among the 412 (51.1%) patients who received HC, 355 (86.2%) patients were started on HC treatment before the institution of mechanical ventilation. The median daily doses (interquartile range [IQR]) of HC were 400 (400-480) mg and 422.2 (400-480) mg in the HC and HC+AZ groups, respectively.

The unadjusted mortality rates were 19.2%, 22.9%, and 9.4% in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.001), in patients who were treated with HC at any time during the hospitalization period (Table 2 ). The unadjusted rates of mechanical ventilation were 19.0%, 20.5%, and 19.9% in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups, respectively (p = 0.94), in patients who were treated with HC prior to mechanical ventilation (Table 2). The unadjusted rates of invasive mechanical ventilation were 16.7%, 19.1%, and 14.6% in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups, respectively (p = 0.37), in patients who were treated with HC prior to invasive mechanical ventilation (Table 2). Among patients who received HC treatment before mechanical ventilation, the unadjusted rates of mortality at any time were 14.0%, 15.9%, and 15.7% in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups, respectively (p = 0.84; Table 2). Among patients who underwent mechanical ventilation and did not receive HC treatment before ventilation, the unadjusted mortality rates were 58.6%, 60.7%, and 33.3% in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups, respectively (p = 0.05; Table 2).\nAdjusted Hazard Ratios for the 807 Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients Using the Right-Censored, Length-Biased Cox Proportional Hazards Model after Propensity Score Adjustment\n		Mechanical Ventilationa	Invasive Ventilation	Death	Death after Mechanical Ventilationa	Death after Invasive Ventilation	 			aHR (95% CI)	p Value	aHR (95% CI)	p Value	aHR (95% CI)	p Value	aHR (95% CI)	p Value	aHR (95% CI)	p Value	 	HC	versus no HC	1.19 (0.78-1.82)	0.42	1.27 (0.81-2.0)	0.30	1.83 (1.16-2.89)	0.009	2.11 (0.96-4.62)	0.06	0.75 (0.20-2.79)	0.67	 	HC+AZ	1.09 (0.72-1.66)	0.69	1.12 (0.71-1.76)	0.62	1.31 (0.80-2.15)	0.28	1.25 (0.59-2.68)	0.56	0.46 (0.11-1.79)	0.28	 	\naHR, adjusted hazard ratio; HR, hazard ratio\nMechanical ventilation includes both non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation\nAfter propensity score adjustment for clinical characteristics, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.89; p = 0.009), but not in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.80-2.15; p = 0.28), when compared to the no HC group (Table 3 ). The propensity-score-adjusted risk of mechanical ventilation was not significantly different in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.78-1.82; p = 0.42) or in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.72-1.66; p = 0.69), compared to the no HC group (Table 3).\nWe then performed a subanalysis by examining the cohort of patients who were admitted during the first 4 weeks of the study period (March 9-April 6, 2020). This cohort of 425 patients had dispositions of death or discharge by the end of the study period and thus did not encounter the issue of length-biased sampling and differential rates of right-censored observations among the groups. The baseline demographics, comedications, comorbidities, and clinical and laboratory characteristics of this subcohort, presented in Table S1, were similar to those of the entire patient cohort. In this cohort, 114 (26.8%) and 148 (34.8%) patients were treated with HC and HC+AZ, respectively, although 163 (38.4%) patients did not receive HC at any time during the hospitalization period (Figure S1). The median daily total doses of HC treatment in this cohort were 414.2 (400-480) mg and 433.3 (400-480) mg in the HC and HC+AZ groups, respectively. The median (IQR) durations of treatment with HC were 5 (3-6) and 5 (4-6) days in the HC and HC+AZ groups, respectively (Table S1). Among these 425 patients, there were 87 (20.5%) deaths and 338 (79.5%) hospital discharges. The unadjusted mortality rates in this cohort were 26.3%, 26.4%, and 11.1% in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups, respectively, when HC treatment was initiated at any time during the hospitalization period (p &lt; 0.001) and 19.2%, 16.2%, and 23.4% in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups, respectively, in patients who received HC treatment before mechanical ventilation (p = 0.28; Table S2).\nAfter propensity score adjustment for clinical characteristics in this subcohort, there was no significant difference in risk of death from any cause in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.50-1.92; p = 0.98) or in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.45-1.77; p = 0.74), when compared to the no HC group (Table S3). The propensity-score-adjusted risk of mechanical ventilation in this subcohort was not significantly different in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.78-2.39; p = 0.28) or in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.62-2.09; p = 0.67) compared to the no HC group (Table S3).\nLength of Stay Comparison between the Treatment Groups in the Subcohort of 425 Patients\nCumulative Distribution Function of the Length of Hospital Stay	 		Length of Stay (Days)	 		25%	50%	75%	p Value	 	No HC	1	4	7	&lt;0.001	 	HC	4	7	12		 	HC+AZ	5	8	13		 	Length of Stay Ratio and 95% CIs of Patients Who Received Hydroxychloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine with Azithromycin Compared to Patients Who Did Not Receive Hydroxychloroquine Using Gamma Distributions with Log Links and Propensity Score Adjusted	 		Length of Stay Ratio (95% CI)	p Value	 	HC	versus no HC	1.33 (1.06-1.67)	0.01	 	HC+AZ	1.38 (1.11-1.72)	0.004	 	\nCI, confidence interval\nAmong these 425 patients, the unadjusted median (IQR) lengths of stay (days) were 7 (4-12), 8 (5.0-13), and 4 (1-7) in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups, respectively (Table 4 ). After propensity score adjustment, the length of hospital stay was 33% (95% CI, 6%-67%; p = 0.01) longer in the HC group and 38% (95% CI, 11%-72%; p = 0.004) longer in the HC+AZ group (Table 4) when compared to the no HC group.\nDiscussion\nHC and remdesivir are the only two drugs that have received emergency use authorizations from the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19.   Given the longer development, testing, and approval times for novel chemical entities, repurposing drugs already approved for other indications is a promising approach to rapidly identify an effective therapy. HC is at the forefront of repurposing drug candidates. Although ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies are expected to provide more evidence about HC in the near future, the outcomes observed in our retrospective study provide substantial information about the use of HC with or without AZ from the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. Specifically, we found that HC use with or without co-administration of AZ did not improve mortality or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation.\nSubsequent to the release of preliminary data from our study on April 21, 2020, two different groups from New York confirmed our findings in larger cohorts.   The findings of our study are similar to the observational study from a New York hospital, which reported no beneficial effect of HC treatment on respiratory failure or mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. However, that study did not report on the effectiveness of HC when co-administered with AZ. In addition, we present the hazards of mortality and use of ventilation separately, unlike that study, which considered both these outcomes as a composite measure. Given the number of clinical trials currently testing the combination of HC and AZ for COVID-19 and the potential synergistic toxicity of these drugs,   it is important to gather insights into the outcomes of patients treated with both HC and AZ. The results of our study are also similar to another recent study from 25 New York hospitals, which reported that use of HC, with and without AZ, was not associated with reduced mortality but did not report on the risk of mechanical ventilation. That study found that patients receiving HC and AZ had a higher risk of cardiac arrest. Recently, a large multinational registry analysis study demonstrated an increased risk in mortality and ventricular arrhythmias in patients treated with HC or chloroquine with or without macrolides. Although that study reported an absence of difference in baseline characteristics among the groups, it considered only two measures of disease severity and did not correct for many relevant laboratory variables. The results of our nationwide study not only confirm findings from both regional studies from New York but, in addition, after propensity score adjustment based on multiple variables, showed comparable mortality and mechanical ventilation rates to the multinational study. In addition to these retrospective observational studies, a recent randomized control trial assessing the efficacy of HC for mild to moderate COVID-19 did not observe any beneficial effect of HC treatment. \nThe overall mortality rate:19.3% of the patients with known outcomes of death/discharge by April 29, 2020:in our study was lower compared to large descriptive studies from China (28%) and Italy (26%) and similar to a large case series reported from New York City (21%). The multinational study reported a mortality rate of 9.3% in the control group and a range of 16.4%-23.8% in all groups with chloroquine or HC with or without macrolides. Despite the increased baseline disease severity in HC and HC+AZ groups, the vast majority of them survived (78.9%). It also bears noting that patients with increased baseline disease severity (low oxygen saturation, high systolic blood pressure, elevated D-dimers, and lymphopenia) or with comorbidities associated with poor outcomes (cancer, chronic pulmonary disease, and diabetes) were not only in the HC or HC+AZ groups, as a substantial fraction of these patients were also in the no HC group.\nIn our study, 19.1% of patients required invasive ventilation compared to 17% and 12.2% reported by the studies from China and New York, respectively.   Further, 56% of patients received HC as treatment for COVID-19, which is similar to the data from a questionnaire survey of physicians from 30 countries that reported that 61% of them prescribed HC for COVID-19 and also similar to a recent study reporting on the outcomes of HC for COVID-19, in which 59% of patients were treated with HC.   \nHC has been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro with a 50% maximal effective concentration (EC50) ranging from 4.5 muM to 17 muM. However, the approved dosing regimens (200 mg twice daily, which was also the median dose in our study) for HC in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or lupus generate substantially lower peak serum drug concentrations (~1 muM).   Administering higher doses of HC to achieve presumed antiviral concentrations might increase the risk of adverse events. Of note, a randomized, controlled trial of high-dose chloroquine, the parent compound of HC that also has been reported to have in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and similar peak serum concentrations in humans, was halted prematurely due to cardiac toxicity and higher fatality rates in the high-dose chloroquine-treated COVID-19 patients. \nIn this retrospective study, after adjusting for several relevant confounders, no benefit from HC treatment with or without AZ was observed in survival outcomes, the need for mechanical ventilation, or length of stay among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The results of our study benefit from certain strengths. For example, because we studied data from a comprehensive electronic medical record rather than from an administrative health insurance claims database, we used rigorously identified covariates and outcomes. We studied patients in an integrated national healthcare system; therefore, the data are less susceptible to biases of single-center or regional studies. The median drug dosage and treatment duration of HC of patients in this study indicate that the treatment regimen used was similar to the treatment regimens in The Outcomes Related to COVID-19 Treated with Hydroxychloroquine among In-Patients with Symptomatic Disease (ORCHID) trial conducted by the NIH and several other randomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of HC for COVID-19. The mortality rates (overall as well as before or after ventilation) and the rates of mechanical ventilation in our study are similar to those reported in a large retrospective case series of 5,700 patients from New York City. Ultimately, forthcoming results of prospective randomized clinical trials of HC conducted in several countries both in the inpatient and outpatient setting are expected to provide more definitive guidance in the coming months.\nLimitations of Study\nOur study has certain limitations, including those inherent to all retrospective analyses, especially the non-randomization of treatments, which could significantly impact the results. We did, however, adjust for a large number of COVID-19-relevant confounders, including comorbidities, medications, and clinical and laboratory values. Despite propensity score adjustment for a large number of relevant confounders, we cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias or residual confounding. Additionally, the use of codes (e.g., international classification of diseases [ICD]-10) to identify clinical characteristics and study outcomes cannot be considered equivalent to medical chart review or prospective data collection. Our study cohort comprised patients whose median age was 70 years, not dissimilar to the median age reported in the large studies from Italy and New York.   Although a quarter of the patients in our study ranged in ages from 22 to 60 years, the results still may not necessarily reflect outcomes in younger hospitalized populations, nor can they be extrapolated to pediatric patients. As 91% of all US veterans are male, our findings may also be influenced by the demographic composition of patients in our cohort, the majority of whom were black, mirroring the disproportionately higher rates of COVID-19-related hospitalization among the black population in the United States.   Our results do not pertain to the use of HC, with or without AZ, in the outpatient setting, nor do they provide insights regarding the efficacy of pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis. However, the FDA and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) have both recently recommended against the use of HC in outpatient settings and outside of clinical trials.   Finally, there are many factors that can influence the management decisions that cannot be accounted for in retrospective studies. For example, the do-not-resuscitate status/level of patients, which could impact treatment patterns, was not evaluated in this study.\nSTAR Methods\nResource Availability\nLead contact\nFurther information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Jayakrishna Ambati, MD, University of Virginia School of Medicine, 415 Lane Road, Charlottesville, VA 22908 (ja9qr@virginia.edu)\nMaterials availability\nThis study did not generate new unique reagents.\nData and code availability\nThese analyses were performed using raw data that are available only within the US Department of Veterans Affairs secure research environment, the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI). All relevant data outputs are within the paper and its supplemental information.\nExperimental Model and Subject Details\nThis national retrospective cohort study evaluated information on hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Data were extracted from the Veterans Affairs Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), which includes inpatient, outpatient data (coded with International Classification of diseases (ICD) revision 9-CM, revision 10-CM), laboratory, and pharmacy claims. The completeness, utility, accuracy, validity, and access methods are described on the VA website, https://www.virec.research.va.gov. The study was conducted in compliance with the Department of Veterans Affairs requirements, received VA Institutional Review Board, and VA Research &amp; Development approval.\nMethod Details\nStudy population\nWe developed a cohort of hospitalized patients with positive results on SARS-CoV-2 testing. SARS-CoV-2 status was classified by laboratory results that were extracted from the VA laboratory data. A text search for SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests was used to query VA lab results. The study index was based on the date of a hospitalization with a positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test within one day prior to hospitalization. This strict time criterion was included for the following reasons: 1) As the number of VA outpatient clinics vastly outnumber the number of medical centers, many patients tested at these outpatient clinics and confirmed with COVID-19 could have been admitted at other hospital centers and then transferred to VA medical centers and the baseline data at admission from these patients would not be completely accessible; 2) The prehospitalization usage of hydroxychloroquine would be unknown if the time lag between the positive test and hospitalization were longer and could result in placing these patients in the wrong cohort; and 3) This time criterion also will exclude potential hospital admission for other reasons. Index dates ranged from March 9, 2020 to April 28, 2020, and patients were followed from index until April 29, 2020, hospital discharge or death. The period prior to index is designated as the baseline period and on or after index is designated the follow-up period. Inclusion Criteria: Patients were included in the study if their information contained 1) a body mass index, 2) vital signs during an encounter (temperature, heart rate and blood pressure), and were 3) either discharged, died in hospital or were currently hospitalized as of the study end date. Exclusion Criteria: Patients were excluded if they did not meet these criteria.\nOutcomes and exposure coding\nThe study outcomes are the result of the hospitalization (discharge or death), whether ventilation was required, the type of ventilation and the result of hospitalization among patients requiring ventilation. Mechanical ventilation included patients receiving both noninvasive and invasive forms of ventilation. Mechanical and invasive ventilation were coded using HCPCS/CPT/ICD-10-PCS codes (Table S4). The results of the hospitalization were coded from the discharge disposition status on the inpatient record. Hospitalization data were taken from the VA inpatient hospitalization data.\nPatients were assigned to one of three cohorts based on medication exposure: 1) HC-treated; 2) HC- and AZ-treated; or 3) HC-untreated. Patients were exposed to hydroxychloroquine if they had a dispensed drug from the VA bar code medication administration (BCMA) data file during their hospitalization. Similarly, if patients received azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine during their hospitalization, they were categorized HC- and AZ-treated. Patients with no hydroxychloroquine exposure were coded as HC unexposed. To examine the HC treatment association with study outcomes, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin exposures were coded dynamically.\nCovariates\nAt baseline (date of admission), for each patient, we extracted demographic, comorbid, clinical (vital signs) and pharmacy data including variables associated with increasing severity of Covid-19.   Demographic and clinical characteristics included age, sex, race, and body mass index (BMI). For comorbid conditions, we utilized ICD-10-CM codes and the Charlson comorbidity index. Vital sign data include heart rate, pulse oximetry, respirations, temperature, and blood pressure (BP). All vital sign data were collected at the first set of vital results during the patient's hospitalization and all were prior to ventilation if applicable. Laboratory data during hospitalization were also evaluated for each patient and consisted of liver function tests, albumin, bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, erythrocytes, hematocrit, platelets, white blood cells, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, troponin, D-Dimer, lactate hydrogenase, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\nQuantification and Statistical Analysis\nStatistical Analysis\nThe statistical analysis for this study was conducted in multiple steps. First, we generated summaries of the baseline demographic, comorbid, and clinical characteristics for each treatment cohort group (HC, HC+AZ, and no HC). Continuous variables were analyzed with the ANOVA F-test and categorical variables with the chi-square test, or where applicable Fisher's exact test. Second, we compared the frequencies of patients who required ventilation, died or were discharged alive from the hospital by treatment status using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test. In our study cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the date of onset of symptoms is unknown and, while we include important baseline clinical factors, bias may still result. Length-bias may occur because there are potentially systematic differences in the time from symptom onset to hospitalization in our sample, compared to the general, non-VA, population. We used a Cox proportional hazards model for length-biased and right censored data implemented in the R package CoxPhLb. The Cox model was fit using time-dependent treatment and propensity score adjustment. We utilized a time-dependent propensity score fit using a multinomial logistic regression, including all baseline factors and time in hours. We estimated the propensity scores for HC treatment alone, as well as HC and AZ combination treatment. We included these propensity scores into the Cox proportional hazards model using restricted cubic splines with 3 knots.   We did not use inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) for two reasons: 1) in the presence of multinomial treatments IPTW can produce extreme weights and unreliable estimates; and 2) the results are more sensitive to model specification when weighting directly on the propensity score. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute) and R software, version 3.6.1 (the R project [http://www.r-project.org]).\nSubanalysis\nWe conducted a subanalysis of 425 patients who were admitted during the first 4 weeks of study (March 9 to April 6, 2020) to avoid the potential biases that could emerge from length biased sampling and right censoring of data from patients in the original cohort who remained in the hospital as of the study end date. Among this subset we utilized a time-dependent Cox model to estimate hazard ratios for treatment and outcome. Finally among this subset we use a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and log link to estimate differences in lengths of stay, in hours, between the treatment groups. To account for differences in the cohorts we include restricted cubic splines of the propensity scores into the length of stay model.\nReferences\nHydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro\nHydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial\nThe QT interval in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin\nA pilot study of hydroxychloroquine in treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19\nClinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 pneumonia who require oxygen: observational comparative study using routine care data\nAssessment of QT intervals in a case series of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection treated with hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin in an intensive care unit\nRisk of QT interval prolongation associated with use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin among hospitalized patients testing positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nAgainst pandemic research exceptionalism\nOutcomes of hydroxychloroquine usage in United States veterans hospitalized with Covid-19\nObservational study of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with Covid-19\nAssociation of treatment with hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin with in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 in New York state\nHydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19: a multinational registry analysis\nHydroxychloroquine in patients with mainly mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019: open label, randomised controlled trial\nClinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study\nBaseline characteristics and outcomes of 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy Region, Italy\nPresenting characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes among 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York City area\nDosage of antimalarial drugs for children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

The registry comprised data from\n671 hospitals in six continents.\n\n We included patients hospitalised\nbetween Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory\nfinding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of\ninterest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment\ngroups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide,\nhydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and\npatients who received none of these treatments formed the control group.\n\n\nPatients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more\nthan 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation,\nas well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded.\n\n The main\noutcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of\nde-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular\ntachycardia or ventricular fibrillation).\n\n\nFindings\n96?032 patients (mean age 53·8\nyears, 46·3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study\nperiod and met the inclusion criteria.\n\n Of these, 14?888 patients were in\nthe treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received\nchloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221\nreceived hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81?144 patients were in\nthe control group.\n\n 10?698 (11·1%) patients died in hospital.\n\n After\ncontrolling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or\nethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its\nrisk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking,\nimmunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared\nwith mortality in the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine (18·0%;\nhazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223–1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a\nmacrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368–1·531), chloroquine (16·4%; 1·365,\n1·218–1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368,\n1·273–1·469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of\nin-hospital mortality.\n\n Compared with the control group (0·3%),\nhydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935–2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a\nmacrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106–5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561,\n2·760–4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344–4·812)\nwere independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo\nventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe were unable to confirm a benefit\nof hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a\nmacrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19.

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.\n\n We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

Influenza Disease Burden from Population-Based Surveillance Data in the United States","abstract":"Annual estimates of the influenza disease burden provide information to evaluate programs and allocate resources.\n We used a multiplier method with routine population-based surveillance data on influenza hospitalization in the United States to correct for under-reporting and estimate the burden of influenza for seasons after the 2009 pandemic.\n Five sites of the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) collected data on the frequency and sensitivity of influenza testing during two seasons to estimate under-detection.\n Population-based rates of influenza-associated hospitalization and Intensive Care Unit admission from 2010–2013 were extrapolated to the U.\nS.\n population from FluSurv-NET and corrected for under-detection.\n Influenza deaths were calculated using a ratio of deaths to hospitalizations.\n We estimated that influenza-related hospitalizations were under-detected during 2010-11 by a factor of 2.1 (95%CI 1.7–2.9) for age &lt; 18 years, 3.1 (2.4–4.5) for ages 18-64 years, and 5.2 (95%CI 3.8–8.3) for age 65+.\n Results were similar in 2011-12. Extrapolated estimates for 3 seasons from 2010–2013 included: 114,192–624,435 hospitalizations, 18,491–95,390 ICU admissions, and 4,915–27,174 deaths per year; 54–70% of hospitalizations and 71–85% of deaths occurred among adults aged 65+.\n Influenza causes a substantial disease burden in the U.\nS.\n that varies by age and season.\n Periodic estimation of multipliers across multiple sites and age groups improves our understanding of influenza detection in sentinel surveillance systems.\n Adjusting surveillance data using a multiplier method is a relatively simple means to estimate the impact of influenza and the subsequent value of interventions to prevent influenza.\n","id":"PMC4349859","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of
