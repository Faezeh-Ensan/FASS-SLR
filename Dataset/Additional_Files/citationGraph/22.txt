However, limited data was available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reactivation. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb. 10, 2020.\nResults\nAll 55 patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%) patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. One of the 5 patients had progressive lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56 x 109 cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia (from 4.5 to 18.28 x 109 cells per L). All 5 reactivated patients presented normal aminotransferase levels. Throat swab samples from the 5 reactivated patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, indicating all positive for the virus.\nConclusions\nFindings from this small group of cases suggested that there was currently evidence for reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and there might be no specific clinical characteristics to distinguish them.\nIntroduction\nA novel human coronavirus which is a new strain of RNA viruses was recognized in Wuhan, China, in Dec. 2019. The novel coronavirus is now officially named SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been recently identified as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). COVID-19 spread quickly across Hubei Province and other regions of China,   also the global alert for COVID-19 has been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO).   COVID-19 could induce symptoms including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue and lymphopenia in patients, and might result in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and even death in severe cases. \nSARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage in the phylogenetic tree and shares ~80% identity sequencing with the Bat SARS-like coronavirus and the original SARS epidemic virus.   Currently, it remains to be determined the origins and possible intermediate animal vectors of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the mechanism that this virus spread among humans. Despite many reports have characterized the clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological features, as well as treatment and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the information of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation remains not reported. The curative and eradicative therapy for COVID-19 is not currently available. Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether patients with COVID-19 pneumonia will reactivate, and whether risk factors predict SARS-CoV-2 reactivation in patients. To prevent and control COVID-19 reactivation, we retrospectively collected and analyzed detailed clinical data from SARS-CoV-2 reactivated patients. In the study, we presented clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 reactivated patients and discussed the potential risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.\nMaterial and methods\nStudy design and patients\nWe retrospectively recruited 55 patients who were diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan. 8, 2020 to Feb. 10, 2020. The patients comprised 19 males and 36 females with a median age of 37 (range 22-67 years). Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program. All patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were tested positively for SARS-CoV-2 by use of quantitative RT-PCR on samples from the respiratory tract. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission for emerging infectious diseases.\nData collection\nWe reviewed clinical records, laboratory findings, and chest CT scans for all patients. Two study investigators independently reviewed the data. Throat swab samples were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2, following WHO guidelines for qRT-PCR.   \nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was done with SPSS, version 22.0. Continuous variables were directly expressed as a range. Categorical variables were expressed as number (%).\nResults\nAt presentation, all 55 patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%) patients who discharged from hospital presented SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. The age range of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivated patients was 27-42 years. None of the reactivated patients had underlying diseases such as diabetes, chronic hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. One patient, however, had history of tuberculosis in the mediastinal lymph node in 2009. Additionally, all the reactivated patients excluded influenza virus and H7 avian influenza virus infection upon admission to hospital.\nClinical and laboratory characteristics.\nTable 1	 	\nClinical characteristics	Patient 1	Patient 2	Patient 3	Patient 4	Patient 5	 	Date of admission	Jan. 3	Jan. 13	Jan. 27	Jan. 22	Jan. 20	 	Sex	Male	Male	Female	Female	Female	 	Age (years)	30	42	32	27	31	 	Epidemiological history	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	 	SARS-CoV-2 negative to positive (days)	4	8	17	15	9	 	Complications	None	None	None	None	None	 	Signs and symptoms						 	Fever on admission	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	 	Cough	No	Yes	No	No	No	 	Dyspnoea	No	No	No	No	No	 	Sore throat	No	No	Yes	No	No	 	Fatigue	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	 	Laboratory characteristics						 	White blood cell count (x 109 cells per L)	5.9	7.1	4.4	6.5	4.5	 	Neutrophil count (x 109 cells per L)	3.5	4.5	1.8	4.1	2.6	 	Lymphocyte count (x 109 cells per L)	1.7	1.3	1.7	1.7	1.4	 	Monocyte count (x 109 cells per L)	0.63	1.24	0.75	0.58	0.4	 	Eosinophil count (x 109 cells per L)	0.13	0.05	0.02	0.09	0	 	Basophile count (x 109 cells per L)	0.02	0.04	0.03	0.02	0.02	 	C-reactive protein (mg/L)	18.7	23.7	NA	&lt;0.50	NA	 	Elevated ALT (&gt;45 U/L) or AST (&gt;35 U/L)	No	No	No	No	No	 	ALT (U/L)	40	16	11	9	10	 	AST(U/L)	32	19	20	13	22	 	Confirmatory test (SARS-CoV-2 PCR)	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	 	CT evidence of pneumonia						 	Typical signs of viral infection	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	 	Treatment						 	Antiviral therapy	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	 	Antibiotic therapy	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	 	Use of corticosteroid	Yes	Yes	No	No	Yes	 	\nNA=not applicable. ALT=alanine transaminase. AST=aspartate transaminase.\nFour of the 5 patients presented with a fever without chills, one had a high fever (39.3  C). Patients' body temperatures fluctuated within a range from 36.2 to 39.3  C. One patient showed normal body temperature. Other symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection were also observed: one patient had cough, one had sore throat, all patients reported fatigue (Table 1 ). Additionally, one patient showed constipation. However, none of the 5 patients developed severe pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation, or died of COVID-19 pneumonia, as of Feb. 24, 2020.\nChest CT scans of the 5 patients.\nFig 1\nAll the 5 reactivated patients were given empirical antibiotic treatment and were administered antiviral therapy (Table 1). Data from laboratory tests showed that one patient had progressive lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56 x 109 cells per L) and progressive elevated neutrophilia (from 4.5 to 18.28 x 109 cells per L). Two patients had elevated concentrations of C-reactive protein (&gt; 18 mg/L). All the 5 patients had normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). All 5 patients had chest CT scan. All patients showed typical findings of chest CT images-multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in lungs (Fig. 1 ).\nDiscussion\nWe confirmed that in a significantly proportion of COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 reactivation developed after discharging from hospital (9%). We reported clinical data from 5 patients with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. The clinical characteristics of these patients with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation were similar to those of non-reactivated patients with COVID-19 infection. None of the 5 patients developed severe pneumonia or died, as of Feb. 24, 2020. Notably, based on our findings in these 5 patients, there is currently evidence to suggest that a proportion of recovered COVID-19 patients could reactivate.\nThe reactivated patients included 1 asymptomatic patient and 4 symptomatic patients, which suggests the reactivation potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients. The time from SARS-CoV-2 negative to positive ranged from 4 to 17 days, suggesting that recovered patients still may be virus carriers and require additional round of viral detection and isolation.\nWe need better data to determine risk factors and mechanisms that cause SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. The timing of onset of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation can be variable depending upon the host factors, underlying disease and the type of immunosuppressive therapies. In our study, the recovered patients had positive RT-PCR test results 4-17 days later. The key risk factors for reactivation would include 3 categories: (1) host status, (2) virologic factors and (3) type and degree of immunosuppression. Host factors may include sex, older age, type of disease needing immunosuppression. Although we could not identify risk factors for these host factors in the current study, the potential requires further large cohort confirmation. The virologic factors associated with increased risk of reactivation include high baseline SARS-CoV-2 load and variable genotype. SARS-CoV-2 viral load would also linked to treatment response, disease severity and progression. The association of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes and viral load with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation will be an important question to address. In our study, all the patients received antiviral therapy (Oseltamivir or Arbidol). These cases suggest that SARS-CoV-2 reactivation may occur whatever the antiviral therapy used. These host and virologic factors are important considerations that may further increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Therefore, the assessment of host as well as virologic risk factors should be important caveats to help decide whether to initiate prophylactic therapy and immunosuppression. Immunosuppressive therapies are the commonly used causative agents. These agents have a general mechanism that inhibits many immune functions. For example, steroid inhibits cell-mediated immunity by suppressing interleukins production which is important for T and B cell proliferation. It is thus not surprising that these general immunosuppressive effects result in broad immune dysfunctions and potential SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.\nSARS-CoV-2 reactivation will be a vexing and persistent problem. Considering numerous patients infected or previously exposed to the virus, such a problem poses a major public health burden in terms of global morbidity and possibly mortality. Currently, we did not find reliable markers in predicting the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation, nor there are any validated tests to determine whether a particular drug or therapy is associated with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. The latter point was often determined by our empirical experience. Although decades of the experiences helped us to identify important drugs and to manage these situations appropriately, we could not accurately evaluate the risk of the drugs prior to its clinical application.\nConsidering the significance of this ongoing global public health emergency, although our conclusions are limited by the small sample size, we believe that the findings are important to understand the clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 reactivation potential in COVID-19 patients.\nFunding/support\nThis study was supported in part by grants from Medical Science Advancement Program (Clinical Medicine) of Wuhan University (TFLC2018002).\nRole of the funders/sponsors\nThe funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nStatement of patient consent\nAll patients provided written informed consent.

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

virus detection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.\n\n To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5?×?104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2?×?104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains.\n\n Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains.\n\n Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative results.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5153932","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"World Health Organization","authors":[{"firstname":"Victor

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by

infections in adults and children.\n While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be

During the post-discharge surveillance after clinical recovery, swabs were positive in two asymptomatic cases (3.23%). Case 1 had presented typical clinical and radiological manifestations on admission, while manifestation in Case 2 was very mild. In conclusion, a small proportion of recovered patients may test positive after discharge, and post-discharge surveillance and isolation need to be strengthened.\nSince early December 2019, several pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology have occurred in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout China. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has named this virus SARS-CoV-2, and it belongs to the same species as SARS-CoV. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) has named the virus-infected pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As at 5 March 2020, a total of 80,409 COVID-19 cases and 3,012 deaths (3.75%) have been reported in mainland China. The 52,045 recovered cases (64.73%) were further quarantined at home for at least 2 weeks. However, potential infectivity of these recovered cases was still unclear. Thus, we implemented consecutive virus surveillance among medical staff recovered from COVID-19 at our hospital and aimed to investigate their potential infectivity after discharge.\nCase follow-up\nSince January 2020, 62 medical staff of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University have been diagnosed with COVID-19 by detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in throat swab samples according to the manufacturer's protocol (Shanghai BioGerm Medical Technology, Shanghai, China). Briefly, the RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 amplifies simultaneously two target genes: open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and the ORF for the nucleocapsid protein (N). Target 1 (ORF1ab): forward primer CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA; reverse primer ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA; probe 5'-VIC-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3'. Target 2 (N): forward primer GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT; reverse primer CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG; probe 5'-FAM- TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3'. Positive (pseudovirus with a fragment of ORF1ab and N) and negative (pseudovirus with a standard fragment) quality control samples were tested simultaneously. A cycle threshold (Ct) value of less than 37 was defined a positive test, while a Ct value of more than 40 was defined as a negative test. For the cases with an intermediate Ct value (37-40), a second sample was tested and weakly positive was defined as a recurrence of Ct value of 37-40. The diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation from the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China).\nAll confirmed cases were hospitalised and isolated for treatment. The discharge criteria were: (i) afebrile for at least 3 days, (ii) obvious alleviation of respiratory symptoms, (iii) improvement in radiological abnormalities on chest computed tomography (CT) or X-ray and (iv) two consecutive negative detections of SARS-CoV-2 at least 24 h apart. After discharge, all cases were kept under surveillance and quarantined at home for at least 14 days; all cases had a throat swab test for SARS-CoV-2 every day or every other day at least 5 times. For those with positive virus detection during this period, we extracted and analysed the medical records.\nThis study was approved by the ethics committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (Number 2020011), and written informed consent was obtained from patients.\nCase 1\nCase 1 was a male doctor in his 40s with an exposure history to COVID-19 patients. He experienced fever (up to 39.3  C), chill and fatigue on 15 January (Figure 1). Chest CT showed lung infection in the lower left lobe on 18 January, and he was admitted to hospital on the same day. During the hospitalisation from 18 January to 10 February, his condition first deteriorated and then reached remission on 28 January. Throat swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 were positive on 28 January and 2 February, and turned negative on 7 and 9 February. Stool tests of SARS-CoV-2, first conducted on 7 February, were also negative on 7 and 9 February. The exact Ct values were unavailable.\nThroat swab virus tests and chest computed tomography findings of COVID-19 Case 1 from symptom onset to post-discharge, China, January-February 2020\nChest CT showed worse status on 18, 20, 23 and 29 January and showed improved status on 4 February. \nRed: positive virus detection in throat swabs; pink: weakly positive virus detection in throat swabs; green: negative virus detection in throat swabs; dates marked with an asterisk: negative virus detection in stool.\nAfter discharge on 10 February, he was kept under surveillance and quarantined at home. He did not experience discomfort during the follow-up period. The results of consecutive throat swab tests were negative on 13 February, weakly positive on 14 February, positive on 15 February, negative on 16 February, weakly positive on 18 February, negative on 20 February and negative on 22 February. Stool was not tested after discharge.\nCase 2\nCase 2 was a female nurse in her 20s. She experienced headache and pharyngalgia but no fever on 29 January (Figure 2). Throat swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 were positive on 31 January and 2 February. However, chest CT showed no abnormalities on 2 February. This patient was admitted to hospital on 5 February. Throat swab test remained positive on 6 February and turned negative on 10 and 12 February. Stool was not tested in Case 2.\nThroat swab virus tests and chest computed tomography findings in COVID-19 Case 2 from symptom onset to post-discharge, China, January-February 2020\nChest CT showed no abnormalities on 2, 4 and 12 February. Red: positive virus detection in throat swabs; pink: weakly positive virus detection in throat swabs; green: negative virus detection in throat swabs.\nAfter discharge on 13 February, Case 2 was kept under surveillance and quarantined at home. She did not experience discomfort during the follow-up. The results of consecutive throat swab tests were weakly positive on 14 and 15 February, negative on 16, 17 and 18 February, positive on 19 February and negative on 20, 21 and 22 February.\nDiscussion\nOn 21 February 2020, a previously recovered COVID-19 patient in Chengdu (Sichuan province, China) was re-hospitalised after testing positive for the virus. This aroused our great concern regarding potential infectivity of the recovered patients, especially for those asymptomatic cases with positive virus detection after discharge.\nIn our study, we conducted surveillance by regular virus testing and detected two positive cases (3.23%) among the 62 recovered medical staff. Surprisingly, Case 1 showed typical clinical and radiological manifestations on admission, while the manifestation in Case 2 was not typical. Moreover, both throat swab and stool tests turned negative in Case 1 before discharge. During home isolation, none of the two cases experienced discomfort, indicating that disease relapse was unlikely.\nCurrently, it is difficult to find a reasonable explanation for these observations. It was assumed that the virus can easily be detected in the upper respiratory tract at the stage of early infection. When the disease progressed, the virus was more likely to appear in the lower respiratory tract and other locations such as intestines and blood. Thus, the virus may not be detected in throat swabs, especially for cases without expectoration. This may explain why some patients had negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 at initial presentation despite positive findings in chest CT, or positive RT-PCT and negative CT findings at initial presentation. \nMoreover, our findings seem to indicate that after hospitalised treatment, there could be a possibility that a small proportion of clinically recovered patients may still carry a small amount of virus which is hard to detect. The current standard for diagnosing COVID19, the RT-PCR-based method, showed a high accuracy of 97% and the specific primers and probes guaranteed its diagnostic specificity, although 3% of cases may test false-negative because of potential sampling error. Both cases had a positive detection (including weakly positive) three times during the follow-up, which decreased the possibility of false positives in these two cases.\nAfter fulfilling the Chinese current criteria for discharge, it may still take a few days for the immune system to completely eliminate the residual viruses in the body. During this period, the virus may rebound and test positive, but the patients were asymptomatic and chest CT showed no deterioration. If the patients' immunity decreases, there is a risk of a relapse. On 6 February 2020, a recovered COVID-19 patient in Changde (Hunan province, China) had a fever and cough 2 days after discharge, and chest CT showed worsened status.\nConclusion\nA small proportion of recovered patients may have positive virus detection after discharge, and the positivity does not necessarily mean that the patient is transmissive. These findings need further investigation and thus post-discharge surveillance is suggested.\nConflict of interest: None declared.\nAuthors' contributions: All authors collected the clinical data.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

of 2019-nCoV infected patients: implication of multiple shedding routes","abstract":"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world.\n It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease.\n Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs.\n However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral–fecal route by infecting intestines.\n Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested.\n We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus.\n We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route.\n We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology.\n Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.\n","id":"PMC7048229","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taylor &amp;

cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese

Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but gained little information on the organ distribution of SARS?associated coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS?CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS?CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS?CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS.\n SARS?CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle.\n These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS?CoV may also be targets of SARS?CoV infection.\n The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS?CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection.\n In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS?CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission.\n This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS?CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways.\n This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS.\n Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n

(2)Stage-2 (5-8d days): increased crazy-paving pattern 9/17 patients (53%) with a increase in total CT score (6±4, p=0.002); (3) Stage-3 (9-13days): consolidation 19/21 (91%) patients with the peak of total CT score (7±4); (4) Stage-4 (?14 days): gradual resolution of consolidation 15/20 (75%) patients with a decreased total CT score (6±4) without crazy-paving pattern.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233367","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Radiological Society of North America","authors":[{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shan","surname":"Gui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shan","surname":"Gui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lingli","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lingli","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiazheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiazheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard L.","surname":"Hesketh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard L.","surname":"Hesketh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lian","surname":"Yang","email":"yanglian@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lian","surname":"Yang","email":"yanglian@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuansheng","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuansheng","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1148/radiol.2020200343","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Chest CT for Typical 2019-nCoV Pneumonia: Relationship to Negative RT-PCR Testing","abstract":"Some patients with positive chest CT findings may present with negative results of real time reverse-transcription–polymerase chain- reaction (RT-PCR) for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n In this report, we present chest CT findings from five patients with 2019-nCoV infection who had initial negative RT-PCR results.\n All five patients had typical imaging findings, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) (5 patients) and/or mixed GGO and mixed consolidation (2 patients).\n After isolation for presumed 2019-nCoV pneumonia, all patients were eventually confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection by repeated swab tests.\n A combination of repeated swab tests and CT scanning may be helpful when for individuals with high clinical suspicion of nCoV infection but negative RT-PCR screening","id":"PMC7233363","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Radiological Society of North America","authors":[{"firstname":"Xingzhi","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Liu","email":"junliu123@csu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"National Health Commission of Changde (China).

Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk.

Although Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections have a higher mortality rate than does COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 spreads much more rapidly than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Reliable data for profiles of serial viral load and serum antibody responses are needed urgently to guide antiviral treatment, infection control, epidemiological measures, and vaccination. The peak viral load of patients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections occurs at around 7-10 days after symptom onset, which could be associated with nosocomial outbreaks involving health-care workers. Clinical studies of antiviral agents for SARS showed that the viral load decreased significantly with treatment success. No systematic study of these two important variables with statistical analysis has been done for SARS-CoV-2, although preliminary descriptive studies have been reported. \nResearch in context\n Evidence before this study \nWe searched PubMed on Feb 24, 2020, with no limitations by starting date, with the terms &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;coronavirus&quot;, &quot;antibody&quot;, and &quot;viral load&quot;; we restricted our search to articles published in English. Our search did not retrieve any reports on clinical progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with respect to temporal viral load and concomitant serum antibody profiles. We identified one correspondence piece on viral load with no statistical analysis, and another article with a few cases of antibody response.\n Added value of this study \nWe present findings of an observational cohort study of the temporal profile of viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses, dated by symptom onset and correlated with clinical findings. Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time. EIA of IgG and IgM against internal viral nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) showed correlation between antibody response and neutralising antibody titre.\n Implications of all the available evidence \nPosterior oropharyngeal saliva specimens are non-invasive and acceptable to patients and can be used for initial diagnosis and subsequent viral load monitoring of COVID-19. The early peaking of viral load has important implications for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and hospital settings. EIA of IgG and IgM against internal viral NP and surface spike protein RBD can be used for those with delayed presentation or retrospective diagnosis of mild cases. As the positive EIA antibody level correlates well with neutralising antibody titre, further studies on its role in immunopathology or antiviral therapy are warranted.\nIn most studies of respiratory virus infections, serial sampling of nasopharyngeal or throat swabs is used for viral load monitoring. However, collection of nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimens can induce coughing and sneezing, which generates aerosol and is a potential health hazard for health-care workers. Collection of throat swabs also requires direct inspection of the patient's posterior pharynx and tonsils. Furthermore, collection of nasopharyngeal specimens is a relatively invasive procedure, which is uncomfortable and can even induce bleeding. A patient's reluctance to provide a sample can account for the paucity of timepoints in viral load studies of respiratory virus infections. Findings of previous studies have shown high concordance between saliva and nasopharyngeal aspirate as specimens for laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viruses. We have reported use of posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva for diagnosis and viral load monitoring in a cohort of 12 patients with COVID-19. Here, we report use of self-collected posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, which avoids close contact between health-care workers and patients, for viral load monitoring. We also monitored serial serum antibody levels of patients.\nMethods\nPatients\nWe included consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital and Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical and epidemiological criteria as outlined and updated by the Hospital Authority. Initial laboratory confirmation was done using nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens at the Public Health Laboratory Centre of Hong Kong. We excluded patients if archived saliva or serum samples were insufficient for testing.\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW 13-372). Since archived specimens were used, written informed consent was waived. 12 of 23 patients included in this study have been reported previously, but their clinical information, viral load by single copy RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-helicase gene, antibody response, or viral genome analysis has not been reported before.\nProcedures\nFor viral load monitoring, all patients were asked to produce an early morning saliva sample from the posterior oropharynx (ie, coughed up by clearing the throat) before toothbrushing and breakfast, because nasopharyngeal secretions move posteriorly and bronchopulmonary secretions move by ciliary activity to the posterior oropharyngeal area while the patients are in a supine position during sleep. Patients were instructed and supervised by nurses. Viral transport medium was added to the saliva specimen. If patients were intubated, we obtained endotracheal aspirate instead of posterior oropharynx saliva. Our initial experience showed that such saliva samples are promising in viral load monitoring in patients with COVID-19. We also retrieved serum remnant from blood samples taken for routine biochemical testing, and refrigerated these samples at -20 C until antibody testing could be done.\nWe recorded clinical findings in a predesigned database, including a patient's history and physical examination and findings of haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations. We defined severe disease as the need for supplemental oxygen, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), or death.\nRecombinant NP and RBD of spike protein used for EIA\n(A) Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showing purity of His-tagged RBD of spike protein (lane 1) and His-tagged NP (lane 3). Lane 2 is protein molecular weight marker. (B) Western-blot analysis of RBD of spike protein (lane 1) and NP (lane 2) using anti-His monoclonal antibody. Positive control (NP of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus) is in lane 3 and negative control (GST-tagged protein) is in lane 4. (C) Western-blot confirmatory assay of NP using patient's serum. Anti-His monoclonal antibody in lane 1, negative patient serum in lane 2, serum samples from a patient with COVID-19 obtained during the acute phase of illness (5 days after symptom onset) in lane 3 (dilution 1 part to 100 parts) and during the convalescent phase (18 days after symptom onset) in lane 4 (dilution 1 part to 3200 parts), lane 5 (1 part to 1600 parts), and lane 6 (1 part to 800 parts). (D) Western-blot confirmatory assay with spike protein RBD using serum samples from patients with COVID-19. Anti-His monoclonal antibody in lane 1, negative patient serum in lane 2, serum from two patients with COVID-19 in lanes 3 and 4 (dilution 1 part to 100 parts). NP=nucleoprotein. RBD=receptor-binding domain. His=polyhistidine. GST=glutathione S-transferase. COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.\nWe did in-house reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase-helicase gene region, as described (appendix p 1). We did EIAs for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), as described but with modifications. Recombinant NP and spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 were used for the EIAs. We assessed the purity of NP and RBD by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting (figure 1A, B ; appendix pp 2-3). A positive sample was included in each run as a positive control. We used an archived anonymous sample from 2018 as a negative control. The cutoff for seropositivity was set as the mean value of 93 anonymous archived serum specimens from 2018, plus 3 SDs. We verified the validity of EIAs by competitive EIA (appendix p 6) and by western blotting, using patients' serum samples (figure 1C, D; appendix p 9). We did microneutralisation assays and virus culture, as described (appendix pp 1-5). We did whole-genome sequencing using the Oxford Nanopore MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK), as described (appendix p 4). \nStatistical analysis\nWe did statistical analyses using SPSS version 26.0 or PRISM version 6.0. We compared categorical variables using Fisher's exact test and continuous variables with the Mann-Whitney U test. We used Spearman's correlation to assess the relation between age and viral load. A p value less than 0 05 was judged statistically significant.\nRole of the funding source\nThe funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

For statistical analyses, the Mann-Whitney U test was done for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test was done for categorical variables.\nFor severe disease, the total number of patients was eight (two patients died &lt;20 days after symptom onset).\nFor severe disease, samples were available for eight patients; for mild disease, samples were available for seven patients.\nFor severe and mild disease, samples were available for nine patients in each group.\nBetween Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (13 male and ten female). Ten patients had severe COVID-19, of whom all required oxygen supplementation, and 13 patients had mild disease. The median age of patients was 62 years (range 37-75). 11 (48%) of 23 patients had chronic medical illnesses, and the most common underlying diseases were hypertension in six (26%) patients and diabetes in four (17%). Chronic comorbidities were more common among patients with severe COVID-19 (seven [70%] patients with severe disease had chronic comorbidities vs four [31%] with mild disease), although this difference was not significant (table ). Five patients were admitted to the ICU, including three who required intubation. Two patients died.\nThe median interval between symptom onset and hospitalisation was 4 days (range 0-13). On presentation, the most common symptom was fever in 22 patients (96%), followed by cough in five (22%), chills in four (17%), and dyspnoea in four (17%; table). Dyspnoea was significantly more frequent among the ten patients with severe disease than among those with mild disease (four [40%] of ten vs none [0%] of 13; p=0 024). Serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly higher among patients with severe disease than among those with mild disease (74 U/L [range 56-149] vs 60 U/L [38-118]; p=0 026). The lymphocyte count was lower among patients with severe disease than among those with mild disease (0 65 x 109 cells per L [range 0 30-1 90] vs 1 03 [0 57-2 25]), but this difference was not significant (p=0 088). Lymphopenia and neutrophilia were present in a higher proportion of patients with severe disease than in those with mild disease, but the differences were not significant (p=0 090 and p=0 068, respectively).\nChest radiographic abnormalities were seen in 15 (65%) patients. Multifocal ground-glass lung opacities were seen in 17 (74%) patients on CT. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in blood samples in five (22%) patients and rectal swabs in four (27%), but the detection rate between severe and mild cases did not differ (p=0 62 and p=0 57, respectively; table). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any urine specimens. Lopinavir-ritonavir with or without ribavirin or interferon beta 1b was given in 18 (78%) patients at different timepoints after symptom onset.\nTemporal profile of serial viral load from all patients (n=23)\nMost viral load data are from posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples, except for three patients who were intubated, in whom viral load data from endotracheal aspirates are shown separately. Datapoints denote the mean; error bars indicate SD; slope represents best fit line. The number of patients who provided a sample on each day is shown in the table below the plot. D=days after symptom onset. S=saliva. E=endotracheal aspirate.\nIn total, 173 respiratory specimens were obtained from 23 patients (mean 7 5 respiratory specimens per patient). The median viral load at presentation was 5 2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4 1-7 0). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in the saliva of three (13%) patients. Specimens with undetectable viral load were assigned a value of 1 log10 copies per mL. No correlation was noted between days after symptom onset and initial viral load (Spearman's rho=0 48; p=0 97). The viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples was highest during the first week of symptom onset then gradually declined (slope -0 15, 95% CI -0 19 to -0 11; R 2=0 71; figure 2 ). Endotracheal aspirate viral load was available from day 8 after symptom onset and showed a non-significant decline (slope -0 13, 95% CI -0 31 to 0 04; R 2=0 15). Of the 21 patients who survived, seven (33%) had viral RNA detected for 20 days or longer after symptom onset. No association was seen between prolonged detection of viral RNA (&gt;=20 days after symptom onset) and severity of illness (p=0 35). One patient had viral RNA detected for up to 25 days after symptom onset; another patient had undetectable viral load on days 21 and 22 after symptom onset, with rebound of viral load on days 23 and 24, followed by 5 days of undetectable viral load.\nRelation between viral load and age or disease severity\nCorrelation between age and peak viral load (A). Comparison of initial (B) and peak (C) viral load between severe and mild cases. Comparison of initial (D) and peak (E) viral load between patients with comorbidities and those without comorbidities.\nA significant positive correlation between age and peak viral load was noted (Spearman's rho=0 48, 95% CI 0 074-0 75; p=0 020; figure 3A ). The median initial (p=0 56) and peak (p=0 52) viral loads in severe cases were about 1 log10 higher than those in mild cases, although the difference was not significant (figure 3B, C). The initial (p=0 49) and peak (p=0 29) viral loads did not differ between patients without comorbidities and those with comorbidities (figure 3D, E). For patients with both viral load and antibody results available in week 1 or week 3, median viral load was 6 70 log10 copies per mL (range 4 17-8 64), and the concomitant median optical density (OD) for anti-NP IgG was 0 13 (range 0 10-1 83) in week 1, whereas in week 3, median viral load was 4 91 log10 copies per mL (range 3 99-8 94) and the concomitant median OD for anti-NP IgG was 2 59 (range 2 12-2 65).\nTemporal profiles of serum IgM and IgG against NP and spike protein RBD, as ascertained by EIA\nEach line represents an individual patient. NP=nucleoprotein. RBD=receptor-binding domain. OD450-620=optical density at 450-620 nm.\n108 serum specimens were obtained from 23 patients (mean 4 7 serum specimens per patient). An increase was noted in IgG or IgM antibody levels against NP or RBD for most patients at 10 days or later after symptom onset, as shown by OD values in EIA (figure 4 ). When comparing the onset of seropositivity between anti-RBD and anti-NP, more patients had earlier seropositivity for anti-RBD than anti-NP for both IgG (RBD earlier, ten [43%] of 23 vs NP earlier, two [9%] of 23) and IgM (RBD earlier, six [26%] of 23 vs NP earlier, four [17%] of 23). When comparing the onset of seropositivity between IgG and IgM, more patients had earlier seroconversion for IgG than IgM for anti-NP (IgG earlier, six [26%] of 23 vs IgM earlier, one [4%] of 23) and anti-RBD (IgG earlier, 13 [57%] of 23 vs IgM earlier, one [4%] of 23). For 16 patients with serum specimens available for 14 days or longer after symptom onset, the rate of seropositivity was 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15).\nTo assess for host factors that affect the antibody titre, the correlation was analysed between the highest OD value during the convalescent period (third week after symptom onset) and age or comorbidities. Patients with comorbidities had a lower anti-RBD IgG OD than did those without comorbidities, although the difference was not significant (median OD, 0 65 vs 1 32; p=0 15; appendix p 7). No association was seen between comorbidity and anti-NP IgG or IgM OD values, or between age and anti-NP IgM or IgG or anti-RBD IgM or IgG OD values (appendix p 8).\nCorrelation between MN antibody titres and anti-NP or anti-RBD IgG or IgM\nOD450-620=optical density at 450-620 nm. MN=microneutralisation. NP=nucleoprotein. RBD=receptor-binding domain.\nSpecimens with microneutralisation assay titres less than 10 were assigned a value of 5, and specimens with microneutralisation assay titres greater than 320 were assigned a value of 640. For one patient, a microneutralisation antibody assay was done with ten serial samples. The correlation between microneutralisation assay titres and anti-NP IgG (R 2=0 99) or anti-RBD IgG (R 2=0 96) was better than those between microneutralisation assay titres and anti-NP IgM (R 2=0 88) or anti-RBD IgM (R 2=0 87; figure 5 ).\nNanopore sequencing was successful for paired samples from four patients. The interval between the first and second specimens was 1-3 days. No viral mutations were identified between paired samples from individual patients.\nDiscussion\nWe analysed the serial viral load, antibody kinetics, and viral genome of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong. For most patients, the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was very high at presentation and declined steadily. Despite development of antibodies against surface and internal proteins of SARS-CoV-2, viral RNA could still be detected in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from a third of patients for 20 days or longer. Peak viral load correlated positively with age. Most patients had an antibody response at 10 days or later after onset of symptoms. Viral whole-genome sequencing of paired samples from four patients did not identify any single nucleotide polymorphisms.\nA high viral load on presentation of COVID-19 was recorded in our cohort, even for patients who were hospitalised shortly after symptom onset. Using nasal swab and throat swab, Zou and colleagues have also reported a high viral load shortly after symptom onset. However, in that study, only cycle threshold values (not exact viral loads) were reported, and no statistical or correlative analysis was done with clinical variables such as age, comorbidities, disease severity, and antibody response. The viral load profile of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of influenza, which peaks at around the time of symptom onset, but contrasts with that of SARS-CoV at around 10 days and that of MERS-CoV at the second week after symptom onset. The high viral load on presentation suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily, even when symptoms are relatively mild. This finding could account for the efficient person-to-person transmission noted in community and health-care settings. Clusters in families, workplaces, religious gatherings, and food premises have been widely reported. \nThe viral load profile is important for guiding antiviral treatment. Since viral load had already peaked around the time of hospital admission, the risk of emergence of antiviral resistance could be similar to that of single-drug treatment of influenza by adamantanes, acid polymerase inhibitors, and neuraminidase inhibitors. However, our previous clinical trial of influenza treatment showed that a triple antiviral combination could significantly improve the clinical outcome and viral load profile and could reduce emergence of resistant virus quasispecies. Currently, no standard treatment is available for COVID-19. For SARS-CoV infection, our previous treatment study showed that a combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin led to significantly fewer complications (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome) or deaths than reported with historical controls treated with ribavirin. Lopinavir-ritonavir or interferon beta 1b also reduced lung damage and decreased viral load in a non-human primate model of MERS-CoV. Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor with in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, the idea that SARS-CoV 3C-like protease was the antiviral target of lopinavir was based purely on binding in computational modelling. Other protease inhibitors and nucleotide analogues (eg, remdesivir [Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA]) are potential candidates for treatment. Combination treatment with virus-targeting and host-targeting agents to improve clinical outcome should be investigated.\nStudies for SARS-CoV have shown that a high initial viral load was associated with death. However, our study only showed that the median viral load was 1 log10 higher in severe cases than in mild cases, and the difference was not significant. But, older age was associated with a higher peak viral load. In a previous study of patients infected with SARS-CoV, older age was an independent factor associated with higher viral load, as expected for immunosenescence, which impairs our innate and adaptive immune responses.\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected for 20 days or longer in a third of patients who survived in our cohort, and one patient had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected for 25 days. Prolonged detection of viral RNA of 20 days or longer was also commonly seen for patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infections. Prolonged detection of viral RNA represents a challenge for the limited availability of hospital isolation facilities because patients might not be discharged until viral RNA is undetectable in respiratory specimens. Further studies are warranted to ascertain whether patients are shedding live virus, by viral culture of the prolonged RT-PCR-positive specimens obtained from patients with concomitant seropositivity when shedded virions are coated with host antibodies which render them non-infectious.\nA criterion for discontinuation of transmission-based precautions is a negative RT-qPCR result from two sets of nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens. In the current study, one patient with complete symptom resolution tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 again after 2 days of negative findings. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be excreted at low levels despite clinical recovery. Thus, both serial viral load monitoring and antibody response should be considered when making decisions about infection control measures, because viral load seemed to be related inversely to serum antibody response in this study.\nThe antibody profile is vital for timing requests for serological assays and interpretation of antibody test results. Serological diagnosis is important for patients who present late with a very low viral load, below the detection limit of RT-PCR assays. Because most patients have rising antibody titres 10 days after symptom onset, collection of serial serum samples in the convalescent phase would be more useful. Serum IgG amounts can rise at the same time or earlier than those of IgM against SARS-CoV-2. By comparison with findings of a study on IgM and IgG EIA, in which more patients were seropositive for IgG than IgM at day 0 and day 5 of hospital admission, a higher proportion of patients in the current study also had earlier IgG than IgM seroconversion. However, this finding could also be accounted for by a lower sensitivity of the IgM EIA, which warrants investigations with more patients.\nSerum antibody levels were not correlated with clinical severity. Notably, one patient with severe disease had an early antibody response 6 days after symptom onset. Deceased patients infected with SARS-CoV developed faster peak anti-spike antibody responses when compared with patients who recovered and had subsequent reduced B-cell immunity with impaired neutralising ability. In a SARS-CoV macaque model, anti-spike IgG stimulated pulmonary proinflammatory responses and caused acute lung injury. The detrimental effect of anti-spike IgG was attributable to the effect on wound-healing macrophages, which was mediated via the Fcgamma receptor. Our findings showing correlation between antibody level detected by EIA and virus neutralisation titre are especially important for design of vaccine studies, and use of convalescent plasma or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, which could improve clinical outcome or paradoxically cause immunopathological damage to the recipient.\nWhole-genome sequencing on paired samples from four patients was successful and showed no differences in individually paired genome sequences. However, single nucleotide polymorphisms were shown to emerge during hospitalisation for MERS-CoV infection, using a targeted sequencing approach. Further studies in more patients with samples obtained at longer intervals could be more informative.\nA high viral load in throat wash and saliva (up to 108 copies per mL of SARS-CoV RNA) was reported in 17 patients with SARS. In a Chinese macaque model of SARS-CoV, salivary gland ducts were early targets of SARS-CoV and, therefore, were a likely source of the virions found in patients' saliva, particularly early in infection. Because of these important findings, our study used posterior oropharyngeal saliva brought up by a throat-clearing manoeuvre to ascertain the temporal viral load profile. The posterior oropharynx is the meeting point between secretions coming from the posterior nasopharynx and the salivary glands and respiratory secretions swept up from the tracheal-bronchial tree. Testing of saliva could show viral shedding from both the salivary glands and the upper and lower respiratory tract. Moreover, because of greater patient acceptability for posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples than for nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, we obtained 7 5 respiratory specimens per patient for testing. Thus, our temporal viral load profile can be analysed by statistics, unlike previous clinical studies of viral kinetics of infections by highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether the salivary glands can be infected by SARS-CoV-2.\nOur study has several limitations. First, we could only include a few patients, and viral load and antibody titre data were not available everyday. This limitation is a common problem in studies of emerging infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The few patients enrolled does not allow for adjustment for potential confounding factors that could affect viral load or antibody response. Second, 48% of patients enrolled had chronic medical illness, which is a higher proportion than that reported in a large clinical series (24%). Although a lower anti-RBD IgG level was noted among patients with comorbidities, further studies are warranted with more patients. Third, posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples cannot differentiate whether the virus is coming from the nasopharynx or from secretions from the lower respiratory tract; thus, our study cannot indicate whether SARS-CoV-2 has a predilection for both upper and lower respiratory tract. Moreover, some patients might not clear the throat effectively to cough out saliva from deep in the throat, which could decrease test sensitivity when compared with that of nasopharyngeal swabs, particularly in patients with predominant upper respiratory involvement or mild symptoms. Finally, the most abundantly expressed internal NP might have some cross-antigenicity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (90% amino acid homology) and, occasionally, OC43-CoV (38% amino acid homology). Thus, the less abundantly expressed surface spike protein RBD, which is specific for SARS-CoV-2 and is the direct target for neutralising antibodies, was used to guard the specificity of our dual antibody assays. \nCOVID-19 is an emerging infection with many unknowns. This study has shed light on viral kinetics and antibody response in patients and provides scientific evidence for guiding infection control policies and therapeutics. Further virological and immunological studies are needed to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection; infection control measures should be reviewed with the rapidly evolving epidemiology of COVID-19.\nReferences\nA familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster\nMiddle East respiratory

acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats1–4.\n Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5–7.\n Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China.\n The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak.\n The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV.\n Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus.\n Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV.\n In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients.\n Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)—as SARS-CoV.\n","id":"PMC7095418","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xian-Guang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hao-Rui","surname":"Si","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao-Lin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui-Dong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ren-Di","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Qin","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kai","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Quan-Jiao","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Lin","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bing","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Xian","surname":"Zhan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Yi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geng-Fu","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"zlshi@wh.iov.cn","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS-CoV-2 viral load in upper respiratory specimens of infected patients","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Summary of probable SARS cases with onset of illness from 1 November 2002 to 31 July 2003.

diagnosis by altering screening and diagnostic test performance and can complicate prevention and treatment strategies due to drug–drug interactions.\n Post-tuberculosis lung disease is an underappreciated phenomenon in children and adolescents, but is more commonly observed in children and adolescents with HIV-associated tuberculosis.\n This review presents new data related to HIV-associated TB in children and adolescents.\n Data on the epidemiology of HIV-associated TB suggests that an elevated risk of TB in children and adolescents with HIV persists even with broad implementation of ART.\n Recent guidance also indicates the need for new screening strategies for HIV-associated TB.\n There have been major advances in the availability of new antiretroviral medications and also TB prevention options for children, but these advances have come with additional questions surrounding drug–drug interactions and dosing in younger age groups.\n Finally, we review new approaches to manage post-TB lung disease in children living with HIV.\n Collectively, we present data on the rapidly evolving field of HIV-associated child tuberculosis.\n This evolution offers new management opportunities for children and adolescents living with HIV while also generating new questions for additional

coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing

Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but gained little information on the organ distribution of SARS?associated coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS?CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS?CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS?CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS.\n SARS?CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle.\n These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS?CoV may also be targets of SARS?CoV infection.\n The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS?CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection.\n In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS?CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission.\n This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS?CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways.\n This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS.\n Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n

from 23 to 74 years.\n\n Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints.\n\n When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were

postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca

definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS

metaplasia.\n\n Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case.\n\n A giant-cell infiltrate was seen in four patients, with a pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung.\n\n Haemophagocytosis was present in two patients.\n\n The alveolar pneumocytes also showed cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm.\n\n The patient for whom full autopsy was done had atrophy of the white pulp of the spleen.\n\n Electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells corresponding to coronavirus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nSARS is associated with epithelial-cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages in the lung.\n\n The presence of haemophagocytosis supports the contention that cytokine dysregulation may account, at least partly, for the severity of the clinical disease.\n\n The case definition of SARS should acknowledge the range of lung pathology associated with this disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112492","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"John

exposures to 11 index patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during patient care.\n All participants were surveyed about use of mask, gloves, gowns, and hand-washing, as recommended under droplets and contact precautions when caring for index patients with SARS.\n 69 staff who reported use of all four measures were not infected, whereas all infected staff had omitted at least one measure (p=0·0224).\n Fewer staff who wore masks (p=0·0001), gowns (p=0·006), and washed their hands (p=0·047) became infected compared with those who didn't, but stepwise logistic regression was significant only for masks (p=0·011).\n Practice of droplets precaution and contact precaution is adequate in significantly reducing the risk of infection after exposures to patients with SARS.\n The

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

In this study, using pools of overlapping linear B-cell peptides, we report two IgG immunodominant regions on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein that are recognised by sera from COVID-19 convalescent patients. Notably, one is specific to SARS-CoV-2, which is located in close proximity to the receptor binding domain. The other region, which is localised at the fusion peptide, could potentially function as a pan-SARS target. Functionally, antibody depletion assays demonstrate that antibodies targeting these immunodominant regions significantly alter virus neutralisation capacities. Taken together, identification and validation of these neutralising B-cell epitopes will provide insights towards the design of diagnostics and vaccine candidates against this high priority coronavirus.\nCharacterisation of the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 can help the design of serological tests and vaccines. Here, the authors identify two linear epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that elicit neutralising antibodies in several patients and could thus be useful for serology and vaccine development.\nIntroduction\nIn December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in the city of Wuhan in the province of Hubei. The previously unidentified pathogen, which induces symptoms resembling an infection by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was later identified as a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. To date, there are more than four million laboratory-confirmed cases of human Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with over 280,000 deaths across 212 countries and territories (For up to date information consult https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). After being declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020, there is a compelling need to understand and develop effective therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2.\nSARS-CoV-2 uses the spike (S) glycoprotein to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with a better affinity than SARS-CoV S glycoprotein for entry. Thus, blocking the binding to ACE2, or blocking host protease cleavage of S glycoprotein to release the fusion peptide is an efficient strategy to prevent coronavirus entry. Several studies have assessed the immunogenicity of structural domains of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. At the time of writing, findings on SARS-CoV-2 linear epitopes remain mostly limited to bioinformatics prediction of human B- and T-cell epitopes using SARS-CoV as a model, and one recent pre-print described the use of a microarray of overlapping peptides to assess linear epitopes in 10 COVID-19 patients. Five regions on the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV (residues 274-306, 510-586, 587-628, 784-803, and 870-893) were predicted to be associated with a robust immune response, whereas other studies reported candidate epitopes that require validation with patient samples.\nIn this study, we report the antibody profiles of COVID-19 patients and the identification of two immunodominant linear B-cell epitopes on the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, using S glycoprotein pseudotyped lentiviruses, we demonstrate that antibodies recognising these two linear epitopes account for a high proportion of the anti-spike response. These epitopes can potentially be used in the design of more sensitive serological assays for epidemiological or vaccine efficiency assessments.\nResults\nA spike pseudotyped lentivirus assay for virus neutralisation\nCOVID-19 patient sera can neutralise pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\na Sera of COVID-19 patients (n = 25) at 1:1000 dilution were incubated with luciferase expressing lentiviruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein protein for 1 hour prior to infection of CHO-ACE2 cells for 48 hours. Infection levels were determined by luciferase assay, and percentage of neutralisation is presented. Recalled SARS patients (n = 13) and healthy controls (HC) were also conducted in parallel. Dotted lines correspond to 50% neutralisation and baseline of HC. b Sera of recalled SARS patients (n = 13, 1:100 dilution) or a healthy control (Healthy) were mixed with pseudotyped lentivirus expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, prior to incubation with CHO-ACE2 cells for 48 hours. Infection levels were determined by luciferase assay, and percentage neutralisation was analysed. c Dose-response neutralisation of pseudotyped lentivirus titration curves of COVID-19 patients (n = 41, 1:50 to 1:12,800 dilutions). d Dose-response neutralisation of live SARS-CoV-2 virus titration curves of COVID-19 patients (n = 8, 1:16 to 1:65,536 dilutions). Comparison table of IC50 values from two assays. Lines represent non-linear regression robust fit. Source data are provided as a Source Data File.\nTo investigate whether a biosafety level (BSL) 2 approved pseudotyped lentivirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein tagged with a luciferase reporter could detect neutralising antibodies, we performed an initial screen at 1:1000 dilution using sera from 25 convalescent COVID-19 patients and from 13 SARS patients recalled in January-February 2020 as controls (Fig. 1a). Majority of the COVID-19 patients' sera were able to neutralise &gt;50% of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry, whereas recalled SARS patients did not show neutralisation. To validate the absence of neutralisation from the 13 recalled SARS patients, we assessed their neutralisation capacity at a lower dilution of 1:100 against the pseudotyped lentivirus expressing SARS-CoV S or SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins (Fig. 1b). The results indicate that these recalled SARS patients still possess antibodies specific to SARS-CoV albeit at low levels, making them an appropriate control group for subsequent linear B-cell epitope mapping.\nNext, this assay was used to determine the IC50 values of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-neutralising antibodies from the sera of 41 convalescent COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1c). To further validate that this safer pseudotyped lentivirus assay is representative of live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation, we performed antibody neutralisation titrations for eight patients under BSL3 conditions. IC50 values obtained were comparable, validating the lentivirus assay (Fig. 1d). Six patients (2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) with sufficient amount of sera and good neutralising capacity were then selected for further characterisation. Notably, sera from these patients showed similar IC50 values ranging from 694 to 836, except for patient 9, who showed the strongest neutralising activity with an IC50 value of 1603 (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 4).\nTwo specific linear epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein\nCOVID-19 patient sera recognise two linear epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\na Sera of COVID-19 (n = 6) patients at 1:1000 dilution were subjected to peptide-based IgG ELISA using peptide pools covering the entire S protein of SARS-CoV-2 in duplicates. Sera of pooled healthy donors (n = 13) were assessed in parallel. Data are presented as mean patient OD values subtracted of healthy control value are presented, negative values are plotted as zero. b Sera of COVID-19 patients (n = 6) were subjected to peptide-based ELISA for IgG detection using individual peptides of SARS-CoV-2 S peptide pools S14 and S21. The z score values of each patient were calculated using the formula [OD value of patient for peptide-average (OD values of patient)]/standard deviation (OD values of patient). Data shown are from two independent experiments and presented as mean. c Serum peptide binding response of COVID-19 patients on SARS-CoV-2 peptides S14P5 and S21P2, and the corresponding regions on SARS-CoV peptides S45P3 and S51P5, respectively, was determined by ELISA at 1:1000 dilution. Statistical analysis was carried out with paired parametric two-tailed t test (*p &lt; 0.05). d Peptides S14P5 and S21P2 response in 41 COVID-19 patients and 29 healthy controls assessed by ELISA in 1% Triton X-treated plasma fraction at 1:1000 dilution. Data are presented as mean of baseline subtracted OD of two independent experiments and was analysed by Mann-Whitney U test (***p &lt; 0.001). e Spearman correlation of ELISA response from 41 COVID-19 patients to individual peptides from d and sera IC50 neutralisation against SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped lentiviruses (Supplementary Table 4) were shown. Line was drawn using non-linear regression with 1/Y2 weighting. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nWe next assessed the linear antigenic targets from sera of the six selected COVID-19 patients and five recalled SARS patients using a linear B-cell peptide library spanning the entire S glycoprotein of either SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, in pools of five overlapping peptides (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, two distinct peptide pools from SARS-CoV-2 S library, pools S14 and S21, were strongly detected by sera from COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2a) and not by recalled SARS patients or healthy control serum (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Two COVID-19 patients could detect SARS-CoV S library pool S51, which partially overlaps with SARS-CoV-2 pool S21 (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1b). This region encompasses the fusion peptide, which is highly conserved among coronaviruses, suggesting a potential pan-SARS epitope at this location.\nFurther assessment of individual peptides within pools S14 and S21 narrowed down the specific region of interest to peptides S14P5 and S21P2, respectively (Fig. 2b). Recognition of S14P5 and S21P2 was stronger for the peptides of SARS-CoV-2 than on the corresponding SARS-CoV peptides (Fig. 2c). The use of these peptides as potential detection epitopes for serology assessment was further validated with 41 COVID-19 patients and 28 healthy donors (collected before the pandemic). Detection for both S14P5 and S21P2 was consistently and significantly higher in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2d). More importantly, the level of antibodies targeting these two specific peptides determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) significantly correlated with sera neutralising IC50 values (Fig. 2e), suggesting that antibodies directed at these epitopes could neutralise SARS-CoV-2.\nAntibodies against S14P5 and S21P2 can neutralise SARS-CoV-2\nAntibodies against S14P5 and S21P2 linear B-cell epitopes neutralise SARS-CoV-2.\na-b Localisation and sequences of a SARS-CoV-2 specific S14P5 and b pan-CoV S21P2 epitopes on spike (S) protein (PDB: 6VSB) are shown. Each S monomer is denoted as either pink, blue or orange. c-e Pooled sera of COVID-19 patients (n = 6) were added to plates coated with the corresponding peptides to deplete specific antibodies. c-d Validation of depletion by peptide-based ELISA against c depleted or d non-depleted peptides. Data of depleted sera (white bar) were normalised to percentages of the non-depleted sera (grey bar). Data are from one experiment in duplicate. Dotted line represents healthy sera mean value. e Non-depleted and peptide-specific antibody-depleted pooled sera were mixed with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus for 1 hour before infection of CHO-ACE2 cells for 48 hours. Percentage of pseudovirus neutralisation relative to the non-depleted sera, are shown. Data are presented as mean +- SD in triplicates. Statistical analysis was carried out with one-sample t test for each experiment (*p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01). Figure is representative of two independent experiments. Source data are provided as a Source Data File.\nUsing a recently published structure of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein in the prefusion conformation, S14P5 was shown to localise in close proximity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) (Fig. 3a), whereas S21P2 covers part of the fusion peptide (Fig. 3b). To assess the importance of these regions in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, antibody depletion assays were performed against S14P5 and S21P2 (Fig. 3c). Depletion efficiency and specificity were validated by ELISA, and results showed that only antibodies against the respective peptides were depleted (Fig. 3d). Interestingly, sera depleted for antibodies targeting either peptides S14P5, S21P2, or S14P5 + S21P2 significantly reduced the ability to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, as compared with the non-depleted sera controls (Fig. 3e). Taken together, these results demonstrated that antibodies targeting these two linear epitopes account for a significant fraction of the anti-S-neutralising response.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we identified two immunodominant linear B-cell epitopes, S14P5 and S21P2, on the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, and further assessed the functional capacity of COVID-19 patient sera antibodies against these regions using a pseudotyped lentivirus assay. This assay uses safer third-generation lentiviruses, which will greatly benefit the scientific community in allowing rapid and safer assessments and characterisation of neutralising antibody titres in patient blood, and potential monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Depletion assays functionally validated the positive correlation between antibody levels against these epitopes and neutralisation titres against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviruses. Future studies will be needed to fully understand the role and neutralisation capacity of antibodies targeting these regions.\nPeptide S14P5 is localised in close proximity to the RBD. As such, it is plausible that antibodies binding to this region may sterically hinder binding to the ACE2 receptor, thereby abolishing virus infection. Another possibility could be an allosteric effect on ACE2 binding. Supporting our results, the partial sequence of peptide S14P5 was computationally predicted to be immunogenic. Peptide S21P2 partially overlaps with an epitope identified in a recent pre-print and contains a part of the fusion peptide sequence (Fig. 3b). As such, alterations to this region may potentially affect virus fusion. Indeed, targeting the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV fusion peptide region was demonstrated to neutralise coronavirus infection with a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor peptide.\nAlthough our findings showed a robust IgG response against the two identified linear epitopes, it is plausible that they represent a small proportion of the total anti-S antibody response. Nevertheless, antibody depletion assays against S14P5 or S21P2 led to &gt;20% reduction in pseudotyped lentivirus neutralisation, validating that antibodies targeting these linear S regions are important for neutralising SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surprisingly, depletion of antibodies directed against both S14P5 and S21P2 did not significantly decrease the neutralisation as compared with single depletions, suggesting that neutralisation at these regions is not synergistic. Future studies involve the isolation of mAbs targeting these linear epitopes to allow proper quantification and comparison of peptide-specific IgG titres with antibodies directed against the RBD domain, or to other conformational epitopes. It would be interesting to also assess the level of persistence of these antibodies against linear and other conformational epitopes.\nInterestingly, IgG levels against each peptide correlated positively with the patient neutralisation IC50 values, suggesting that quantitative serological assays against these peptides could be used as a proxy for virus exposure status as well as protection levels. However, this will require validation with other patient cohorts. Notably, the two identified epitopes present a low-to-moderate rate to impact mutations, which would minimise the possibility of false negatives in serological assays (Supplementary Table 5).\nTogether, these results will be essential to guide the design and evaluation of efficient and specific serological assays against linear epitopes, as well as help prioritise vaccine target designs during this unprecedented crisis.\nMethods\nEthics statement\nWritten informed consent was obtained from participants in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Sera from healthy volunteers &quot;Study of blood cell subsets and their products in models of infection, inflammation and immune regulation&quot; was approved under study number 2017/2806.\nPatient serum and plasma fractions\nSerum was collected in BD Vacutainer SST II Advance tubes (Fisher Scientific, #12927696). After clotting, serum was separated using centrifugation for 10 minutes at 1000 rcf, and aliquoted before storing at -80  C. Patient serum was heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56  C before usage for this study. Plasma fraction was harvested after 20 minutes centrifugation at 1700 rcf of blood collected in BD Vacutainer CPT tubes (BD, #362753). Plasma samples were treated by solvent/detergent treatment with a final concentration of 1% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #28314) for virus inactivation at RT for 2 hours. Information on selected patients is provided in Supplementary Table 1. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics are described in Supplementary Table 2.\nLinear peptide library\nThe sequences used for the design of biotinylated linear peptides of the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are under GenBank accession numbers NC_004718.3 and MN908947.3. Preliminary epitope screening was used with a library of peptides (Mimotopes, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia) consisting of 18-mer overlapping sequences. Peptides were used individually or as pooled sets. Five to eight peptides were combined to form one pooled peptide set. Lyophilised individual peptides were dissolved in 200 muL of DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, #D8418-100ML) to obtain a stock solution.\nPeptide-based ELISA\nB-cell linear library ELISA was performed in a similar manner to a previously established peptide-based screen. In brief, streptavidin-coated plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #15125) were blocked with 0.1% PBST (0.1% v/v Tween-20, Sigma-Aldrich, #P1379-500ML, in PBS, Gibco, #20012-043) containing 1% w/v sodium caseinate (Sigma-Aldrich, #C8654-500G, lot BCBP6469) and 1% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, #A7030-500G, lot SLBW5033) overnight at 4  C, before addition of pooled or single biotinylated peptides at 1:1000 dilution in 0.1% PBST. Heat-inactivated patient serum samples were added at 1:1000 dilution in 0.1% PBST. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H + L) antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, #109-035-088, lot 139159) prepared in 10% blocking buffer was used for detection of peptide-bound antibodies. In total, 100 muL of TMB substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, #T8665, lot SLCB5343) was used for a 5 minute development and was stopped by addition of 100 muL of 0.16 M sulfuric acid prepared from 95% to 97% Sulfuric Acid stock solution (Merck, #1.00731.1000), prior to absorbance measurements. Absorbance was measured with the following parameters: 450 nm minus 690 nm (bandwidth of 9 nm) in five flashes after a 10 second shaking at 1 mm amplitude on an Infinite M200 plate reader (Tecan, firmware V_2.02_11/06).\nPeptides S14P5 and S21P2 ELISA for 41 COVID-19 patients\nOwing to the limitation of available serum samples, ELISA was performed with 1% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #28314) treated plasma fractions. ELISA was performed in similar conditions as described above with the following modifications. Nunc Maxisorp flat-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #442404) were coated overnight with 50 muL per well of 0.5 mug/mL of NeutrAvidin protein (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #31050). Blocking was performed for 1 hour with 0.01% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA; Sigma-Aldrich, #341584) in 0.1% PBST (blocking buffer) prepared from stock of 0.5% PVA w/v in distilled H2O. Peptide coating was performed at 1:2000 dilution for 1 hour. Secondary antibody was incubated for 1 hour in blocking buffer at 1:1000 dilution. Development was performed with 50 muL of TMB and stopped with 50 muL of 0.16 M sulfuric acid.\nPeptide affinity depletion of pooled sera\nUsing principles similar to previous work, we performed affinity depletion as follows. Selected synthetic biotinylated peptides were added at 1:1000 dilution in 0.1% PBST to pre-blocked streptavidin-coated plates and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Plates were washed three times with 0.1% PBST followed by PBS wash to remove traces of Tween-20. Pooled patient sera were prepared at a dilution of 1:100 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; HyClone, #SH30243.01, lot AE29431634), and 50 muL was added to each well and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature for adsorption. The unbound fraction was collected after 24 rounds of adsorption. ELISA analysis was performed as described above but at 1:2000 dilution to assess the levels of peptide-specific antibodies before and after affinity depletion. Adsorbed samples were then mixed with lentiviruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S protein as described below. Selected peptide sequences are given in Supplementary Table 3.\nCell lines and cell culture\nThe human embryonic kidney epithelial cell 293T (ATCC, CRL-3216) and VERO E6 C1008 (ATCC CRL-1586 were cultured in DMEM (Hyclone, #SH30022.01) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, #10270-106). A stable cell line expressing human ACE2, CHO-ACE2 (a kind gift from Professor Yee-Joo Tan, Department of Microbiology, NUS &amp; IMCB, A*STAR, Singapore) was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% MEM non-essential amino acids solution (Gibco, #11140-050) and 0.5 mg/mL of Geneticin Selective Antibiotic (Gibco, #10131-027). Every 2-3 days, cells were passaged by dissociating the cells with StemPro Accutase Cell Dissociation Reagent (Gibco, #A1110501). ACE2 surface expression on CHO-ACE2 cells was verified using anti-human ACE2 AF647 (Santa Cruz Biotech, #sc-390851, lot B0320). Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination.\nSARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudotyped lentivirus production\nBased on the third-generation lentivirus system, pseudotyped viral particles expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 S proteins were produced by reverse transfection of 30 x 106 of 293 T cells with 12 microg pMDLg/pRRE (Addgene, #12251), 6 microg pRSV-Rev (Addgene, #12253), 12 microg pTT5LnX-coV-SP (SARS-CoV-2 spike) or pXJ3'-S (SARS-CoV spike, a kind gift from Professor Yee-Joo Tan, Department of Microbiology, NUS &amp; IMCB, A*STAR, Singapore) and 24 microg pHIV-Luc-ZsGreen (Addgene, #39196) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, #11668-019) and cultured in a 37  C incubator for 3 days. Viral supernatant was harvested, spun down by centrifugation to remove cell debris and filtered through a 0.45 microm filter unit (Sartorius, #16555). Lenti-X p24 rapid titre kit (Takara Bio, #632200) was used to quantify the viral titres following the manufacturer's instructions.\nPseudotyped lentivirus neutralisation assay\nCHO-ACE2 cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 x 104 cells in 100 microL of complete medium without Geneticin in 96-well Flat Clear Bottom Black Polystyrene TC-treated Microplates (Corning, #3904). After heat-inactivation at 56  C for 30 minutes, serially diluted patient sera were incubated in a 96-well flat-bottom cell culture plate (Costar, #3596) with an equal volume of pseudotyped virus (12 ng of p24) at the final volume of 50 muL at 37  C for 1 h, and the mixture was added to the monolayer of pre-seeded CHO-ACE2 cells. After 1 hour of pseudotyped viral infection at 37  C, 150 microL of culture medium was added to each well and the cells were further incubated for another 48 h. Upon removal of culture medium, cells were washed twice with sterile PBS, and then lysed in 20 microL of 1 x Passive lysis buffer (Promega, #E1941) with gentle shaking at 400 rpm at 37  C for 30 minutes. Luciferase activity was then assessed using Luciferase Assay System (Promega, #E1510) on a Promega GloMax Luminometer.\nLive SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay in BSL3\nUsing a 96-well opaque (white) plate, 25 microL of 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a naso-pharengeal swab of a patient in Singapore, was incubated with 25 microL of the indicated sera dilution for 1 hour at 37  C with 5% CO2. After incubation, 50 microL of 4 x 105 cells/ml (VERO E6 C1008) was added into each well. The plate was subsequently incubated for 4 days at 37  C with 5% CO2. Cell viability was then determined using Viral ToxGlo Assay (Promega, #G8941). In brief, 100 microL of the reagent was added into each well and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature prior to measurement of luminescence readout using microplate reader (Tecan).\nData visualisation and statistical analysis\nStructural data of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was retrieved from Protein Databank (PDB ID: 6VSB) in homotrimeric prefusion conformation and visualised using PyMOL (Schrodinger, version 2.2.0). Data were analysed using Excel for Mac 16.16.8 and GraphPad Prism for macOS version 8.4.1. Statistical tests are indicated in the figure legends. IC50 values of individual patients were calculated using the [Inhibitor] vs response variable slope four parameter of GraphPad Prism, with negative values forced to zero. Correlation between pseudovirus IC50 and OD values were analysed using the non-parametric Spearman correlation and straight line non-linear regression robust fit functions of Prism with data from Supplementary Table 4. For the neutralisation assay with non-depleted and depleted pooled serum, one-sample t test for each experiment was perform to assess if the values were significantly different from 100.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nSupplementary information\nSource data\nPeer review information Nature Communications thanks the anonymous reviewers for their contribution to the peer review of this work.\nPublisher's note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nThese authors contributed equally: Chek Meng Poh, Guillaume Carissimo, Bei Wang.\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41467-020-16638-2.\nAuthor contributions\nC.M.P., G.C., S.N.A., C.Y.P.L. conceptualised, designed, acquired, analysed, interpreted the data and wrote the manuscript.

discovered coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARSCoV).\n\n We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS

of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus","abstract":"A large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been detected in horseshoe bats since 2005 in different areas of China.\n However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV.\n Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China.\n The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Proteases Enhances Virus Entry into Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells <italic>In Vitro</italic>\n","abstract":"Background\nEntry of enveloped viruses into host cells requires the activation of viral envelope glycoproteins through cleavage by either intracellular or extracellular proteases.\n\n In order to gain insight into the molecular basis of protease cleavage and its impact on the efficiency of viral entry, we investigated the susceptibility of a recombinant native full-length S-protein trimer (triSpike) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to cleavage by various airway proteases.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nPurified triSpike proteins were readily cleaved in vitro by three different airway proteases: trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a.\n\n High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and amino acid sequencing analyses identified two arginine residues (R667 and R797) as potential protease cleavage site(s).\n\n The effect of protease-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV infection was demonstrated with ACE2 expressing human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE.\n\n Airway proteases regulate the infectivity of SARS-CoV in a fashion dependent on previous receptor binding.\n\n The role of arginine residues was further shown with mutant constructs (R667A, R797A or R797AR667A).\n\n Mutation of R667 or R797 did not affect the expression of S-protein but resulted in a differential efficacy of pseudotyping into SARS-CoVpp.\n\n The R667A SARS-CoVpp mutant exhibited a lack of virus entry enhancement following protease treatment.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThese results suggest that SARS S-protein is susceptible to airway protease cleavage and, furthermore, that protease mediated enhancement of virus entry depends on specific conformation of SARS S-protein upon ACE2 binding.\n\n These data have direct implications for the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV along the respiratory system and, furthermore expand the possibility of identifying potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2773421","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

cryo-electron microscopy and image processing to investigate conformational changes that occur in the entire spike of intact virions when they bind to the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n We have shown that ACE2 binding results in structural changes that appear to be the initial step in viral membrane fusion, and precisely localized the receptor-binding and fusion core domains within the entire spike.\n Furthermore, our results show that receptor binding and subsequent membrane fusion are distinct steps, and that each spike can bind up to three ACE2 molecules.\n The

Evidence for Bats as the Evolutionary Source of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","abstract":"The evolutionary origins of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are unknown.\n Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from various species in the family Vespertilionidae.\n Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV identified from a Pipistrellus cf.\n hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV.\n Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties.\n Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor.\n To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated.\n Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells.\n Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat.\n Recombination in the S1 subunit of the spike gene was identified as the primary mechanism driving variation

(genera Carollia and Tadarida) for susceptibility to infection by different enveloped RNA viruses.\n None of the cells were sensitive to infection by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus, or to infection mediated by the Spike (S) protein of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) incorporated into pseudotypes based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).\n The resistance to infection was overcome if cells were transfected to express the respective cellular receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N for TGEV or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 for SARS-CoV.\n VSV pseudotypes containing the S proteins of two bat SARS-related CoV (Bg08 and Rp3) were unable to infect any of the six tested bat cell lines.\n By contrast, viral pseudotypes containing the surface protein GP of Marburg virus from the family Filoviridae infected all six cell lines though at different efficiency.\n Notably, all cells were sensitive to infection by two paramyxoviruses (Sendai virus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus) and three influenza viruses from different subtypes.\n These results indicate that bat cells are more resistant to infection by coronaviruses than to infection by paramyxoviruses, filoviruses and influenza viruses.\n Furthermore, these results show a receptor-dependent restriction of the infection of bat cells by CoV.\n The implications for the isolation of

bind their molecular target (antigen) by recognizing a portion of its structure (epitope) in a highly specific manner.\n The ability to predict epitopes from antigen sequences alone is a complex task.\n Despite substantial effort, limited advancement has been achieved over the last decade in the accuracy of epitope prediction methods, especially for those that rely on the sequence of the antigen only.\n Here, we present BepiPred-2.0 (http://www.\ncbs.\ndtu.\ndk/services/BepiPred/), a web server for predicting B-cell epitopes from antigen sequences.\n BepiPred-2.0 is based on a random forest algorithm trained on epitopes annotated from antibody-antigen protein structures.\n This new method was found to outperform other available tools for sequence-based epitope prediction both on epitope data derived from solved 3D structures, and on a large collection of linear epitopes downloaded from the IEDB database.\n The method displays results in a user-friendly and informative way, both for computer-savvy and non-expert users.\n We believe that BepiPred-2.0 will be a valuable tool for the bioinformatics and immunology

that only one receptor-binding domain of the trimeric S glycoprotein binds ACE2 and adopts a protruding “up” conformation.\n In addition, we studied the structures of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and its complexes with ACE2 in different in vitro conditions, which may mimic different conformational states of the S glycoprotein during virus entry.\n Disassociation of the S1-ACE2 complex from some of the prefusion spikes was observed and characterized.\n We also characterized the rosette-like structures of the clustered SARS-CoV S2 trimers in the postfusion state observed on electron micrographs.\n Structural comparisons suggested that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein retains a prefusion architecture after trypsin cleavage into the S1 and S2 subunits and acidic pH treatment.\n However, binding to the receptor opens up the receptor-binding domain of S1, which could promote the release of the S1-ACE2 complex and S1 monomers from the prefusion spike and trigger the pre- to postfusion

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice.\n\n VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

Virus (HIV) and the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) have been demonstrated to be informative of viral fitness.\n Such patterns can be seen as footprints of the intrinsic functional constraints placed on viral evolution under diverse selective pressures.\n Here, considering multiple HIV and HCV proteins, we demonstrate that these mutational correlations encode a modular co-evolutionary structure that is tightly linked to the structural and functional properties of the respective proteins.\n Specifically, by introducing a robust statistical method based on sparse principal component analysis, we identify near-disjoint sets of collectively-correlated residues (sectors) having mostly a one-to-one association to largely distinct structural or functional domains.\n This suggests that the distinct phenotypic properties of HIV/HCV proteins often give rise to quasi-independent modes of evolution, with each mode involving a sparse and localized network of mutational interactions.\n Moreover, individual inferred sectors of HIV are shown to carry immunological significance, providing insight for guiding targeted vaccine

of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Receptor-binding Domain Complexed with Neutralizing Antibody<","abstract":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV, or SCV), which caused a world-wide epidemic in 2002 and 2003, binds to a receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its envelope (spike, S) glycoprotein.\n The RBD is very immunogenic; it is a major SCV neutralization determinant and can elicit potent neutralizing antibodies capable of out-competing ACE2. However, the structural basis of RBD immunogenicity, RBD-mediated neutralization, and the role of RBD in entry steps following its binding to ACE2 have not been elucidated.\n By mimicking immune responses with the use of RBD as an antigen to screen a large human antibody library derived from healthy volunteers, we identified a novel potent cross-reactive SCV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, m396, which competes with ACE2 for binding to RBD, and determined the crystal structure of the RBD-antibody complex at 2.3-Ä resolution.\n The antibody-bound RBD structure is completely defined, revealing two previously unresolved segments (residues 376–381 and 503–512) and a new disulfide bond (between residues 378 and 511).\n Interestingly, the overall structure of the m396-bound RBD is not significantly different from that of the ACE2-bound RBD.\n The antibody epitope is dominated by a 10-residue-long protruding ?6–?7 loop with two putative ACE2-binding hotspot residues (Ile-489 and Tyr-491).\n These results provide a structural rationale for the function of a major determinant of SCV immunogenicity and neutralization, the development of SCV therapeutics based on the antibody paratope and epitope, and a retrovaccinology approach for the design of anti-SCV vaccines.\n The available structural information indicates that the SCV entry may not be mediated by ACE2-induced conformational changes in the RBD but may involve other conformational changes or/and yet to be identified coreceptors.\n","id":"PMC8099238","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"ASBMB.

Approaches and Validation of Model Predictions by <italic>In Vitro</italic> Testing","abstract":"Viral immune evasion by sequence variation is a major hindrance to HIV-1 vaccine design.\n To address this challenge, our group has developed a computational model, rooted in physics, that aims to predict the fitness landscape of HIV-1 proteins in order to design vaccine immunogens that lead to impaired viral fitness, thus blocking viable escape routes.\n Here, we advance the computational models to address previous limitations, and directly test model predictions against in vitro fitness measurements of HIV-1 strains containing multiple Gag mutations.\n We incorporated regularization into the model fitting procedure to address finite sampling.\n Further, we developed a model that accounts for the specific identity of mutant amino acids (Potts model), generalizing our previous approach (Ising model) that is unable to distinguish between different mutant amino acids.\n Gag mutation combinations (17 pairs, 1 triple and 25 single mutations within these) predicted to be either harmful to HIV-1 viability or fitness-neutral were introduced into HIV-1 NL4-3 by site-directed mutagenesis and replication capacities of these mutants were assayed in vitro.\n The predicted and measured fitness of the corresponding mutants for the original Ising model (r?=??0.74, p?=?3.6×10?6) are strongly correlated, and this was further strengthened in the regularized Ising model (r?=??0.83, p?=?3.7×10?12).\n Performance of the Potts model (r?=??0.73, p?=?9.7×10?9) was similar to that of the Ising model, indicating that the binary approximation is sufficient for capturing fitness effects of common mutants at sites of low amino acid diversity.\n However, we show that the Potts model is expected to improve predictive power for more variable proteins.\n Overall, our results support the ability of the computational models to robustly predict the relative fitness of mutant viral strains, and indicate the potential value of this approach for understanding viral immune evasion, and harnessing this knowledge for immunogen design.\n","id":"PMC4125067","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Jaclyn

wider range of proteases.\n The exact location of the CoV fusion peptide (FP) has been disputed.\n However, most evidence suggests that the domain immediately downstream of the S2? cleavage site is the FP (amino acids 798–818 SFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGFMKQY for SARS-CoV, FP1).\n In our previous electron spin resonance spectroscopic studies, the membrane-ordering effect of influenza virus, HIV, and Dengue

bead array assays, significant and functional T-cell immunity was induced by 10 ?g of the rNTD vaccination with aluminum and CpG adjuvant.\n Furthermore, rNTD-immunized mice showed reduced lung

that rNTD induced potent cellular immunity and antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice and that it demonstrated protective capacity against a viral challenge, indicating that rNTD is a

inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infection in vitro and in vivo.\n HR2P-M2 was highly effective in inhibiting MERS-CoV S protein–mediated cell-cell fusion and infection by pseudoviruses expressing MERS-CoV S protein with or without mutation in the HR1 region.\n It interacted with the HR1 peptide to form stable ?-helical complex and blocked six-helix bundle formation between the HR1 and HR2

However, the structural basis of RBD immunogenicity, RBD-mediated neutralization, and the role of RBD in entry steps following its binding to ACE2 have not been elucidated.\n By mimicking immune responses with the use of RBD as an antigen to screen a large human antibody library derived from healthy volunteers, we identified a novel potent cross-reactive SCV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, m396, which competes with ACE2 for binding to RBD, and determined the crystal structure of the RBD-antibody complex at 2.3-Ä resolution.\n The antibody-bound RBD structure is completely defined, revealing two previously unresolved segments (residues 376–381 and 503–512) and a new disulfide bond (between residues 378 and 511).\n Interestingly, the overall structure of the m396-bound RBD is not significantly different from that of the ACE2-bound RBD.\n The antibody epitope is dominated by a 10-residue-long protruding ?6–?7 loop with two putative ACE2-binding hotspot residues (Ile-489 and Tyr-491).\n These results provide a structural rationale for the function of a major determinant of SCV immunogenicity and neutralization, the development of SCV therapeutics based on the antibody paratope and epitope, and a retrovaccinology approach for the design of anti-SCV vaccines.\n The available structural information indicates that the SCV entry may not be mediated by ACE2-induced conformational changes in the RBD but may involve other conformational changes or/and yet to be identified coreceptors.\n","id":"PMC8099238","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"ASBMB.

2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing

Treatment of Acute Respiratory Failure in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","abstract":"Objectives:\nTo study the effectiveness of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in the treatment of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the associated infection risk.\n\n\nMethods:\nAll patients with the diagnosis of probable SARS admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong from March 9 to April 28, 2003, and who had SARS-related respiratory distress complications were recruited for NIPPV usage.\n\n The health status of all health-care workers working in the NIPPV wards was closely monitored, and consent was obtained to check serum for coronavirus serology.\n\n Patient outcomes and the risk of SARS transmission to health-care workers were assessed.\n\n\nResults:\nNIPPV was applied to 20 patients (11 male patients) with ARF secondary to SARS.\n\n Mean age was 51.4 years, and mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 5.35. Coronavirus serology was positive in 95% (19 of 20 patients).\n\n NIPPV was started 9.6 days (mean) from symptom onset, and mean duration of NIPPV usage was 84.3 h.\n\n Endotracheal intubation was avoided in 14 patients (70%), in whom the length of ICU stay was shorter (3.1 days vs 21.3 days, p &lt; 0.001) and the chest radiography score within 24 h of NIPPV was lower (15.1 vs 22.5, p = 0.005) compared to intubated patients.\n\n Intubation avoidance was predicted by a marked reduction in respiratory rate (9.2 breaths/min) and supplemental oxygen requirement (3.1 L/min) within 24 h of NIPPV.\n\n Complications were few and reversible.\n\n There were no infections among the 105 health-care workers caring for the patients receiving NIPPV.\n\n\nConclusions:\nNIPPV was effective in the treatment of ARF in the patients with SARS studied, and its use was safe for health-care workers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094489","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The American College of Chest Physicians.

December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world. It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral-fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral-fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.\nIntroduction\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. A human coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Most recently, an SARS-related CoV was implicated as the etiological agent responsible for the outbreak in Wuhan, central China. This outbreak is estimated to have started on 12th December 2019 and 17,332 laboratory confirmed cases with 361 deaths as of 3rd February 2020 in China. The virus has spread to 23 other countries by travellers from Wuhan. Typical symptoms are fever, malaise, shortness of breath and in severe cases, pneumonia. The disease was first called unidentified viral pneumonia.\nWe quickly identified the etiological agent, termed 2019-nCoV (virus name designated by the World Health Organization). The newly identified virus is an SARS-related virus (SARSr-CoV) but shares only 74.5% genome identity to SARS-CoV. We developed molecular detection tools based on viral spike genes. Our previous studies indicate that qPCR method can be used for the detection of 2019-nCoV in oral swabs or in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Additionally, we developed IgM and IgG detection methods using a cross-reactive nucleocapsid protein (NP) from another SARSr-CoV Rp3, which is 92% identical to 2019-nCoV NP. Using these serological tools, we demonstrate viral antibody titres increase in patients infected with 2019-nCoV.\nLike SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV induced pneumonia through respiratory tract by clinical observation. Therefore, the presence of viral antigen in oral swabs was used as detection standard for 2019-nCoV. Similarly, two times of oral swabs negative in a 24-h interval was considered as viral clearance by patients officially. Here we launched an investigation of 2019-nCoV in a Wuhan hospital, aiming to investigate the other possible transmission route of this virus.\nMaterials and methods\nSample collection\nHuman samples, including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood samples were collected by Wuhan pulmonary hospital with the consent from all patients and approved by the ethics committee of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases. Two investigations were performed. In the first investigation, we collected samples from 39 patients, 7 of which were in severe conditions. In the second investigation, we collected samples from 139 patients, yet their clinical records were not available. We only showed patients who were viral nucleotide detection positive. Patients were sampled without gender or age preference unless where indicated. For swabs, 1.5 ml DMEM+2% FBS medium was added in each tube. Supernatant was collected after 2500 rpm, 60 s vortex and 15-30 min standing. Supernatant from swabs were added to lysis buffer for RNA extraction. Serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000 g for 15 min within 24 h of collection, followed by 56 C 30 min inactivation, and then stored at 4 C until use.\nRNA extraction and qRT-PCR\nWhenever commercial kits were used, manufacturer's instructions were followed without modification. RNA was extracted from 200 mul of samples with the High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche). RNA was eluted in 50 mul of elution buffer and used as the template for RT-PCR. QPCR detection method based on 2019-nCoV S gene can be found in the previous study. In brief, RNA extracted from above used in qPCR by HiScript  II One Step qRT-PCR SYBR  Green Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd). The 20 mul qPCR reaction mix contained 10 mul 2x One Step SYBR Green Mix, 1 mul One Step SYBR Green Enzyme Mix, 0.4 mul 50 x ROX Reference Dye 1, 0.4 mul of each primer (10 muM) and 2 mul template RNA. Amplification was performed as follows: 50 C for 3 min, 95 C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles consisting of 95 C for 10 s, 60 C for 30 s, and a default melting curve step in an ABI 7500 machine.\nSerological test\nIn-house anti-SARSr-CoV IgG and IgM ELISA kits were developed using SARSr-CoV Rp3 NP as antigen, which shared above 90% amino acid identity to all SARSr-CoVs, as reported previously. For IgG test, MaxiSorp Nunc-immuno 96 well ELISA plates were coated (100 ng/well) overnight with recombinant NP. Human sera were used at 1:20 dilution for 1 h at 37 C. An anti-Human IgG-HRP conjugated monoclonal antibody (Kyab Biotech Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China) was used at a dilution of 1:40,000. The OD value (450-630) was calculated. For IgM test, MaxiSorp Nunc-immuno 96 wellELISA plates were coated (500 ng/well) overnight with anti-human IgM (micro chain). Human sera were used at 1:100 dilution for 40 min at 37 C, followed by anti-Rp3 NP-HRP conjugated (Kyab Biotech Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China) at a dilution of 1:4000. The OD value (450-630) was calculated.\nResults\nIn the first investigation, we aimed to test whether viral positive can be found in anal swab and blood as well as oral swabs. We conducted a molecular investigation to patients in Wuhan pulmonary hospital, who were detected as oral swabs positive for 2019-nCoV upon admission. We collected blood, oral swabs and anal swabs for 2019-nCoV qPCR test using previously established method.\nMolecular detection of 2019-nCoV in swabs and blood. Samples were from oral swabs (OS), anal swabs (AS) and blood. Data were shown as qPCR Ct values. Patients in severe condition during investigation were shown.\n 	OS	AS	Whole blood	Serum	Severe disease	 	Patient 1	33.5	 	 	 	No	 	Patient 2	 	 	30.3	24.3	Yes	 	Patient 3	30.3	 	 	 	No	 	Patient 4	 	 	32.1	 	No	 	Patient 5	 	33.1	 	 	No	 	Patient 6	 	 	30.6	 	No	 	Patient 7	32.7	30.2	 	 	No	 	Patient 8	 	33.1	 	 	No	 	Patient 9	 	 	31.4	34.5	No	 	Patient 10	 	 	30.9	33.0	Yes	 	Patient 11	27.3	 	 	 	No	 	Patient 12	34.4	 	 	 	Yes	 	Patient 13	32.9	33.6	 	 	No	 	Patient 14	32.3	 	 	 	No	 	Patient 15	 	 	31.6	 	No	 	\nWe found 15 patients who still carry virus following days of medical treatments. Of these patients, 8 were oral swabs positive (53.3%), 4 were anal swabs positive (26.7%), 6 blood positives (40%) and 3 serum positives (20%). Two patients were positive by both oral swab and anal swab, yet none of the blood positive was also swabs positive. Not surprisingly, all serum positives were also whole serum positive (Table 1). In summary, viral nucleotide can be found in anal swab or blood even if it cannot be detected in oral swabs. It should be noted that although swabs may be negative, the patient might still be viremic. \nSerological detection of 2019-nCoV. Dashed line indicates cutoff, which was determined based on data from healthy controls.\nWe then did another investigation to find out the dynamic changes of viral presence in two consecutive studies in both oral and anal swabs in another group of patients. The target patients were those who received around 10 days of medical treatments upon admission. We tested for both viral antibody and viral nucleotide levels by previously established method. We showed that both IgM and IgG titres were relatively low or undetectable in day 0 (the day of first sampling). On day 5, an increase of viral antibodies can be seen in nearly all patients, which was normally considered as a transition from earlier to later period of infection (Figure 1 and supplementary table 1). IgM positive rate increased from 50% (8/16) to 81% (13/16), whereas IgG positive rate increased from 81% (13/16) to 100% (16/16). This is in contrast to a relatively low detection positive rate from molecular test (below). \nMolecular detection of 2019-nCoV in swabs from two investigations. Samples were from oral swabs (OS), anal swabs (AS) and blood. Data were shown as qPCR Ct values.\n 	Date 0-OS	Date 0-AS	Date 5-OS	Date 5-AS	 	Patient 1	 	 	23.2	 	 	Patient 2	30.3	 	 	 	 	Patient 3	 	19.5	 	 	 	Patient 4	32.7	30.2	 	 	 	Patient 5	 	33.1	 	 	 	Patient 6	31.1	 	30.0	31.4	 	Patient 7	27.3	 	 	 	 	Patient 8	 	 	27.0	 	 	Patient 9	32.9	33.6	 	 	 	Patient 10	 	 	 	23.8	 	Patient 11	31.9	 	 	 	 	Patient 12	32.3	 	 	 	 	Patient 13	 	 	 	17.8	 	Patient 14	 	 	 	25.5	 	Patient 15	 	 	 	30.0	 	Patient 16	33.8	 	26.9	27.5	 	\nFor molecular detection, we found 8 oral swabs positive (50%) and 4 anal swabs (25%) in these 16 people on day 0. On day 5, we were only able to find 4 oral swabs positive (25%). In contrast, we found 6 anal swabs positive (37.5%). When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%). Another observation is the reoccurrence of virus in 6 patients who were detected negative on day 0. Of note, 4 of these 6 viral positives were from anal swabs (Table 2). These data suggested a shift from more oral positive during early period (as indicated by antibody titres) to more anal positive during later period might happen. \nDiscussion\nWithin 1 month of the 2019-nCoV disease outbreak, we rapidly developed molecular and serological detection tools. This is the first molecular and serological study on this virus after the initial identification of 2019-NCoV from 7 patients diagnosed with unidentified viral pneumonia. We detected the virus in oral swabs, anal swabs and blood, thus infected patients can potentially shed this pathogen through respiratory, fecal-oral or body fluid routes. In addition, we successfully applied serology test a large population and showed which could greatly improved detection positive rate.\nWe show that the current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019-nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative. In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected patients, intestinal infection was observed at later stages of infection. However, patients infected with 2019-nCoV may harbour the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease. It is also worth to note none of the patients with viremia blood had positive swabs. These patients would likely be considered as 2019-nCoV negative through routine surveillance, and thus pose a threat to other people. In contrast, we found viral antibodies in near all patients, indicating serology should be considered for 2019-nCoV epidemiology. A possible shift from oral positive during early infection to anal swab positive during late infection can be observed. This observation implied that we cannot discharge a patient purely based on oral swabs negative, who may still shed the virus by oral-fecal route. Above all, we strongly suggest using viral IgM and IgG serological test to confirm an infection, considering the unreliable results from oral swabs detection.\nIn summary, we provide a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be transmitted through multiple routes.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Institut Pasteur.

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21.

respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus is an extremely dangerous pathogen.\n Here, we report the development of a serologic assay for detection of antibodies to human coronaviruses (HCoVs) based on recombinant nucleocapsid (N) proteins of all known pathogenic strains (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS).\n The novel immunoassay is highly useful for epidemiologic surveys, where use of nucleic acid diagnostics often is limited.\n Purified recombinant antigens were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes and applied in a line immunoassay, which allows rapid detection of antibodies to 5 different HCoVs in a single experiment.\n For assay evaluation, serum samples from persons infected with 229E or OC43 (acute/convalescent), recovered SARS patients and healthy donors were analyzed.\n Screening for nucleocapsid (N)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in convalescent sera reached 100% sensitivity.\n With this new technique, we found that recently identified NL63 and HKU1 contribute significantly to the overall spectrum of coronavirus infections.\n Possibly, cross-reactive antibody responses were observed using 229E and OC43 serum pairs.\n However, the potential of this assay could clearly be demonstrated employing SARS-positive serum samples, where nonspecific binding to nucleocapsids of other HCoVs was not observed.\n This coronavirus strain-specific line immunoassay represents a powerful tool for serologic diagnostics.\n","id":"PMC7127592","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples.\n\n We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked.\n\n\nFindings\nPatients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years.\n\n Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints.\n\n When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild.\n\n Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease.\n\n A virus
