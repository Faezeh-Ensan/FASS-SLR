This longitudinal observational study aimed to investigate the effects of mood states and exercise on nutritional choices, on 176 college students (92 males, 84 females; 23 +- 4 years old) during the COVID-19 lockdown. During 21 days, nutrition and exercise were daily monitored, and the mood states assessed. A factor analysis was used to reduce the number of nutritional variables collected. The relationships between exercise, mood and nutrition were investigated using a multivariate general linear model and a mediation model. Seven factors were found, reflecting different nutritional choices. Exercise was positively associated with fruit, vegetables and fish consumption (p = 0.004). Depression and quality of life were, directly and inversely, associated with cereals, legumes (p = 0.005; p = 0.004) and low-fat meat intake (p = 0.040; p = 0.004). Exercise mediated the effect of mood states on fruit, vegetables and fish consumption, respectively, accounting for 4.2% and 1.8% of the total variance. Poorer mood states possibly led to unhealthy dietary habits, which can themselves be linked to negative mood levels. Exercise led to healthier nutritional choices, and mediating the effects of mood states, it might represent a key measure in uncommon situations, such as home-confinement.\n1. Introduction\nThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the COVID-19 epidemic, was first identified in Wuhan (China) in December 2019. In Italy, the first official cases appeared in late February, and on 9 March, the Italian government placed about 60 million people in a de facto quarantine mode, being asked to live in home-confinement for several weeks, until 4 May.\nIn the last months, several articles have been published regarding the effects of the home confinement and social-isolation period on different domains: psychological states, physical activity, nutrition or the integration of these. Mood disturbances, such as anxiety, depression, anger and irritability, have been previously reported in several studies during quarantine periods, as reviewed by Brooks et al.. Ammar et al. conducted an online survey during the COVID-19 outbreak on over a thousand people in home confinement, reporting reduced mental well-being and satisfaction and increased depression and need for psychological support, compared to the pre-epidemic period. The increased adverse psychological effects were associated with a reduction in physical activity and an increase in unhealthy diet behaviours.\n1.1. Mood and Nutrition\nThe association between diet and mood has been recently systematically reviewed by Arab et al.. The food intake can be involved in regulating mood and emotions, and this can affect the food choices suggesting a bidirectional influence. Indeed, low mood and poor nutrition are mutually connected, one influencing the other and vice versa. For example, it has been reported an alteration in food choices, not always healthy, in response to different psychological states or stress conditions. For example, foods rich in fat and carbohydrate are commonly preferred to be consumed by depressed subjects. On the flip side of the coin, healthy dietary patterns (e.g., Mediterranean diet) are associated with a reduced risk of depression and better mental health. For instance, an inverse association between vegetables and fruits consumption with depression mood has been previously found. Furthermore, the intake of nuts containing unsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols and vitamins may have protective effects against mood and cognitive disorders. Lassale et al. have been able to synthesise the link between diet quality, measured using a range of predefined indices, and depressive outcomes, concluding that adherence to a healthy diet, in particular a traditional Mediterranean diet, or avoiding a pro-inflammatory diet, appears to confer some protection against depression in observational studies. This provides a reasonable evidence base to assess the role of dietary interventions to prevent depression.\n1.2. Exercise and Nutrition\nThe phenomenon known as &quot;multiple health behaviour change&quot; defines the interrelation between health-related behaviours. This concept can be summarised as: the higher the probability of one health-related behaviour, the higher the probability for the other. Indeed, physical exercise and diet were reported to be strictly interconnected. Joo et al. reported a modification in the dietary patterns of young adults after 15 weeks of training. They highlighted that, even if different effects were produced depending on the duration and intensity of the exercise, the overall trend was towards healthier food selection. Donati Zeppa et al. reported that high-intensity exercise promoted a spontaneous and unaware modulation of food choices, leading to a healthier diet in young adults. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, as improved appetite control and a reduction in emotional overeating; healthy nutritional choices and physical exercise seem to share the same pathways which lead to effective behavioural changes towards a healthier lifestyle.\n1.3. Mood, Exercise and Nutrition\nThe interaction between exercise, improved psychological states and healthier eating behaviours was previously proposed by Annesi et al., who reported a reduction in negative moods, an increase in self-regulate eating ability, and a clinically relevant reduction in weight, after six months of moderate-intensity exercise in obese women. Regular exercise practice was shown to positively influence mood, self-efficacy and use of self-regulatory skills, key predictors of controlled eating. However, the direction of relationships between psychological and behavioural variables is difficult to assess. Annesi and Mareno used a mediation model to study these interactions, suggesting a psychological pathway between increased exercise and decreased emotional eating, so highlighting the role of exercise in facilitating nutrition changes.\n1.4. The COVID-19 Context\nGiven the above, the effects of unique conditions:as it has been the COVID-19 outbreak:on psychological states, dietary behaviours and physical activity have been a topic of great interest. Antunes et al. conducted a survey on a sample of Portuguese adults during the epidemic, reporting altered eating habits, with increased quantity and frequency of meals; contrasting results are presented regarding the attention to the food selection. Di Renzo et al. investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits and lifestyle changes among the Italian population aged &gt;=12 years, reporting a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet in the group aged 18-30 years, compared to the younger and the elderly population. Gallo et al. investigated the impact of isolation measures on energy intake and physical activity levels in Australian university students, reporting a reduction in physical exercise levels, and an increase in energy intake and snacking frequency. Interestingly, Romero-Blanco et al. reported that:during home-confinement in Spain:university students that adopted a Mediterranean diet, also spent more time doing physical exercise. Ingram et al. investigated the changes in health behaviours related to negative mood states in a sample of about four hundred adults during the COVID-19 quarantine in the UK, reporting changes in diet, sleep quality, physical activity levels and poorer mental health. Most of the studies above reported had cross-sectional designs, performed through questionnaires or online surveys. It was previously identified that surveys and self-reported food diaries with a short time of data collection are likely to underreporting from participants; however, the 24 h recall for multiple days significantly reduces this effect.\nThe present longitudinal observational study aimed to investigate the effects of mood states and exercise on nutritional choices of a sample of college students, during the period of forced home-isolation due to COVID-19 outbreak. A daily follow-up for three weeks has been done, recording both dietary habits and physical exercise of the participants.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Participants\nA convenience sampling was used in this study. Participants were college students, pertaining to three different study courses (pharmacy, biology and sports sciences) at the Urbino University, following online classes during the data collection period. During the lockdown period, people were allowed to leave home only for health issues, to go to work or to buy food and other essential products (only one family member at the time): therefore, people's movements were limited to the minimum necessary. Bars and restaurants were closed, so people were forced to eat at home. They were invited to take part in the study through verbal explanation of the project during an online class, and later, an email was sent to each of them. All participants read and signed a written informed consent to take part in the study, which was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. They were free to leave the study at any time, without giving any further justification. Once data was collected by the researcher, names were removed and an univocal identity code assigned to every participant, to secure anonymity. Ethics committee approval has been received by the Human Research Ethical Committee of the Urbino University (No. 31_2020).\n2.2. Data Collection\nData collection was conducted during three weeks of home-isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, between 6-26 April 2020 (Figure 1). Before starting to record the diet, participants were asked to add in a pre-structured form their height and weight, if they were spending the isolation period at home with their families, with friends or alone, and if they were used to regularly practicing sports activity before the COVID-19 epidemics. Exclusion criteria were being on a particular dietary regimen (e.g., prescribed by a nutritionist), suffering from chronic diseases, being afflicted by COVID-19 before or during the period, and having a flu during the data collection period.\n2.3. Dietary Habits\nParticipants were asked to daily fill a pre-structured food diary, in which they inserted each food or drink consumed during the whole 24 h, with the quantity (expressed in pieces, e.g., one banana, or grams, e.g., 100 g of pasta). A daily reminder to fill the food diary was sent to every participant during the study period. Diet monitoring has gone on for 21 days (three weeks). After the completion of the data collection, data were manually screened and uploaded on the MetaDieta software (METEDA Srl, San Benedetto del Tronto, Italy), used for the data processing. This software was previously used for monitoring the diet in university students. It automatically calculates the total energy intake and the nutritional values, with macro- and micronutrients quantities, for each food or drink consumed during the day. The following variables were selected for the analyses: carbohydrates (glucides, starch, glycaemic index, glycaemic load), protein (animal-based protein, plant-based protein, protein value), lipids (animal lipids, plant lipids, mono-, polyunsaturated and saturated fats, Omega 3 and 6), fibre (soluble and insoluble), amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine) and vitamins (A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and folic acid). Furthermore, the distribution of energy intake among the different meals throughout the day has been evaluated.\n2.4. Physical Exercise\nOn a separate sheet of the food diary, participants were instructed to add if they trained, with the duration in minutes and the perceived effort (RPE) using the modified CR-10 scale by Foster et al., for each day. The CR-10 scale asked participants to rate their effort answering the simple question &quot;How was your workout?&quot; on a scale from 0 &quot;rest&quot; to 10 &quot;maximal&quot;. The participants were already familiarised with the use of this scale; furthermore, verbal and written instructions on the use of the CR-10 scale and the diary have been provided to all the participants before the beginning of the study. Duration and intensity values were used to calculate the training load, as SessionRPE (duration x intensity). This method was reported to be superior to monitor training loads of fitness workout sessions compared to other heart-rate based methods. The training load has been used as the measure of exercise performed for the statistical analyses. Due to the home isolation restrictions, people were not allowed to go out to do physical exercise; assuming that other forms of physical activities were minimal in this situation, only structured exercise sessions (e.g., runs or rides on treadmill or bike trainers, free-weight exercises) were taken into account.\n2.5. Psychological Scales\n2.5.1. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)\nThe PANAS is a tool that assigns scores based on feeling or emotion-related adjectives. Wordings are rated as positive when it refers to positive emotions and positive interactions with others (e.g., interested, strong, proud). Wordings are rated negative when they involve negative experiences with the world and others (e.g., hostile, nervous, afraid). The brief 20-item scale was used in this study. On each adjective, respondents assign a score on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (very slightly) to 5 (extremely). This tool was previously used with a university student population. The Italian validated version of the PANAS was used in this study.\n2.5.2. Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)\nThe PHQ-9 is a self-administered questionnaire aimed at surveying the nine main criteria for major depression. Participants have to rate, on a 4-point scale (from 0 &quot;not at all&quot; to 3 &quot;nearly every day&quot;), how often they have been bothered by the nine criteria over the last two weeks (e.g., &quot;Little interest or pleasure in doing things&quot;, &quot;Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless&quot;, &quot;Feeling tired or having little energy&quot;). A global score was calculated as a sum of the scores on each item. This questionnaire was validated for depression screening in university students. For this study, we used the validated Italian version of the scale. An oft-used scoring threshold for the presence of depression is: 0-4 = none, 5-9 = mild, 10-14 = moderate, 15-19 = moderately severe, &gt;=20 = severe.\n2.5.3. 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12)\nThe SF-12 is a self-report measure of the impact of health conditions on a person's everyday life. It is used as a measure of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), previously used with university students. The tool covers eight main domains, and these domains can be grouped into two main areas: mental-depending HR-QoL (e.g., &quot;How much of the time during the past 4 weeks have you felt calm and peaceful?&quot;) and physical-depending HR-QoL (&quot;During the past 4 weeks have you accomplished less than you would like with your work or other regular activities as a result of your physical health?&quot;). A global score of HR-QoL can also be calculated by summing the scores on each item. Higher scores on the SF-12 correspond to higher HR-QoL. In this study, we used the validated Italian version of the SF-12.\n2.6. Statistical Analyses\nDescriptive statistics were reported for macronutrients and demographics characteristics. Mean (standard deviation) was used for demographic variables; median (first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles) for training frequencies (sessions/week), psychometric scales' scores and percentage of energy intake distributed in the different meals throughout the day (breakfast, morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner). From the list of macro- and micronutrients obtained from the Metadieta software, given the high number of variables collected, it was appropriate to reduce their number, minimising the loss of information. So, a Principal Axis Factor with a Varimax (orthogonal) rotation of 27 nutritional variables above considered was conducted on data gathered from participants. Kaiser-Meyer Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was also performed; the minimum acceptable value for KMO is 0.6, although the ideal is over 0.70. Only factors with an eigenvalue of &gt;=1 were considered. The variance percentage accounted for by each component to the total variance was also reported. The factor score coefficient matrix was also computed. The resulting component score variables are representative of:and can be used in place of:original variables with an acceptable loss of information (1-total cumulative variance).\nThe internal consistency reliability index for the mood states questionnaire was quantified using Cronbach's alpha. Cronbach's alpha is a measure of internal consistency, that is how closely related a set of items are as a group. It is considered 'moderate' when it is &gt;0.6 and 'good' when it is &gt;0.7.\nIn order to investigate whether psychological states and exercise could be associated with the nutritional choices, a multivariate generalised linear model was performed. The dependent variables were the factors obtained from factor analysis; participant's repeated measures (ID) was a random factor; the fixed factors was sex; finally, training load, mood scales (PANAS, PHQ-9, SF-12) and BMI were covariates. Pillai's trace statistic was used; Pillai's trace is more robust to departures from assumptions than Wilk's lambda, Hotelling's trace, and Roy's largest root. Subsequent univariate ANOVAs were also performed for each dependent variable (factors) considered.\nAverage causal mediation effect: it is the indirect effect of the IV (psychological states) on the DV (factors scores) that goes through the mediator (training load).\nAverage direct effect: it describes the direct effect of the IV on the DV, without mediator effect.\nTotal effect: it stands for the total effect (direct + indirect) of the IV on the DV.\nProportion Mediated: it describes the proportion of the effect of the IV on the DV that goes through the mediator. It is calculated by dividing the mediation effect through the total effect.\nFinally, in order to assess if exercise could mediate the effect of psychological states on nutrition, a mediation effect has been calculated. A mediated effect is also called 'indirect effect', and it occurs when the effect of the independent variables (psychometric scales) on the dependent variable (factors' scores obtained by factor analysis) is:as the name says:mediated by another variable: a mediator (training load). Mandatory condition to establish any mediation effect is that the independent variable (IV) must have a significant effect on the mediator. In mediation analysis, we considered as independent variables the same variables reported in GLM analysis. In mediation analysis, the following estimations are reported:\nAll elaborations were conducted with alpha = 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA), except from the mediation effect that has been calculated with the mediation v.4.5.0 package using R Studio v. 1.2.5033 software. GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) has been used to build the figures.\n3. Results\n3.1. Sample Characteristics\nA total of 250 students were invited to participate in the research. Of these, 176 (response rate: 70.4%) participants (23 +- 4 years old) voluntarily took part in this observational study; all the participants correctly fulfilled the three week daily food diary. Of these 92 were males (178.5 +- 6.3 cm, 73.1 +- 9.8 kg, 22.9 +- 2.6 kg/m2) and 84 were females (164.6 +- 6.6 cm, 58.2 +- 7.5 kg, 21.4 +- 2.5 kg/m2). 141 of them reported practising sports activity, at different levels (from beginner to professional), with a median of four training sessions/week (Q1: 3, Q3: 5). Almost all of them (except seven people) reported having spent the whole lockdown period in their respective residences, with their families.\n3.2. Dietary Habits\nEnergy intake and macro- and micronutrients were analysed daily. Average energy intake of 1742 (+-688) kcal was reported in males, and 1237 (+-486) kcal in females. Macronutrients were distributed in the diet as 48% carbohydrates, 30% lipids and 22% proteins. Energy intake was spread out during the day as so: (median, Q1-Q3): breakfast 14.0% (5.8-22.0%), morning snack 0.0% (0.0-2.0%), lunch 38.0% (29.0-50.0%), afternoon snack 6.0% (0.0-13.0%) and dinner 33.0% (22.0-44.0%). In Figure 2 are reported the average macronutrients (in absolute value, gr) and energy intake (kcal), split for gender. A complete description of the micronutrients can be found as Supplementary Material (Table S1).\n3.3. Factor Analysis\nA Principal axis factor analysis with varimax rotation has been conducted to assess the underlying structure in micro and macronutrients. The analysis yielded a seven-factor solution; the Kaiser-Meyer Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was 0.783, above the minimum ideal value. Table 1 presents the rotated component matrix, eigenvalues, and the percentage of variance explained; note that the seven components explain 77.1% of the variance.\nSeven variables loaded in Factor 1, accounting for 32.0% of the variance; a high intake of carbohydrates characterised it with elevated glycaemic load (including both glucides and starch), plant-based protein and fibre. This factor may be mainly due to cereals, and secondly to legumes consumption. Six variables loaded in Factor 2, accounting for 14.6% of the variance; these were related to vegetable-fats consumption (monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated fats), vitamin E and Omega-6. This factor might be interpreted as dried fruits and vegetable oils intake, as olive oil. Nine variables loaded in Factor 3, accounting for 9.3% of the variance; it was characterised by a high intake of animal-based protein and lipids, with high protein value, saturated and monounsaturated fats, Omega-6, vitamin B6 and Tyrosine, but showed a negative load for glucides consumption. This Factor could be summarised by milk, its derivatives and high-fat meats. Nine variables loaded in Factor 4, accounting for 7.4% of the variance; it was characterised by a prevalence of hydrosoluble (B6, C and folic acid) and liposoluble vitamins (A, E), fibres and plant-based protein with a high protein value. These items lead to fresh vegetables and fruit consumption (in particular wheat germs). Four variables loaded in Factor 5, accounting for 5.0% of the variance; it was characterised by a significant amino acid intake (tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine) and animal-based proteins. Given that this factor is not affected by fats, it could be hypothesised that lean (low-fat) meats represent it. Five variables loaded in Factor 6, accounting for 4.6% of the variance; with a high intake of Omega-3, vitamin B12, vitamin D, animal-based proteins, and polyunsaturated fats, this factor could be easily interpreted as fish consumption. Finally, four variables loaded in Factor 7, accounting for 4.2% of the variance; it was characterised by soluble and insoluble fibres, with negative weights for glycaemic index and load. This Factor could be explained with whole-grain cereals consumption and other vegetables rich in fibres. The above-described factors are graphically summarised in Figure 3.\n3.4. Physical Exercise\nThe exercise was daily monitored by calculating the training load as SessionRPE. On average, participants trained 4.6 +- 3.3 times/week; the mean duration was 54 +- 41 min, with an RPE of 6.6 +- 1.8. As people were not allowed to go outside for training, exercise sessions mainly included indoor walks, runs or rides (on treadmill or bike trainers), rope jumping and free-weight exercises.\n3.5. Psychological States\nA total of 81 (88%) males and 78 (92.9%) females fully responded to the questionnaires.\nThe PHQ-9 scores had a median of 6 (Q1: 3, Q3: 8) for males and 7 (Q1: 6, Q3: 10) for females. A total of 28 males (30.4%) and 9 females (10.7%) were classified as 'none symptoms'. A total of 41 (44.6%) and 49 (58.3%) participants had mild symptoms. A total of 11 (11.9%) and 16 (16.1%) reported moderate symptoms. A total of 1 (1.1%) male and 3 (3.6%) females reported moderately severe symptoms, and only 1 female (1.2%) had severe symptoms of depression. Median for the PANAS positive affect score was 31 (Q1: 26, Q3: 37) for males and 27 (Q1: 23.75, Q3: 34) for females, while for the PANAS negative affect score median was 18 (Q1: 15, Q3: 23) for males and 23 (Q1: 18.75, Q3: 29) for females. The SF-12 score was calculated as the total score. The median for the SF-12 score was 39 (Q1: 35, Q3: 41) for males and 37 (Q1: 34, Q3: 40) for females.\nThe alpha for PHQ-9 was 0.69 (reasonable internal consistency reliability), whilst alpha for PANAS was 0.63 (minimally adequate internal consistency reliability); finally alpha was 0.78 (good internal consistency reliability) for SF-12.\n3.6. Effects of Mood and Exercise on Nutrition\nA multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to assess if gender, BMI, training load and mood states were significantly associated with the linear combination of seven latent factors deriving from factor analysis. No different effects of training volume (duration) or intensity (perceived exertion) have been found, so training load was considered as the only measure of exercise performed. Box's Test of Equality of Covariance Matrices showed a p &lt; 0.001, so Pillai's trace statistic was used. A significant difference was found for all predictor variables: gender, with Pillai trace = 0.019, F(2593,7) = 7.02, p &lt; 0.001; ID, with Pillai trace = 1.474, F(18193,861) = 5.63, p &lt; 0.001; PANAS positive score, with Pillai trace = 0.008, F(2593,7) = 2.69, p = 0.009; PANAS negative score, with Pillai trace = 0.006, F(2593,7) = 2.14, p = 0.037; SF12, with Pillai trace = 0.007, F(2593,7) = 2.69, p = 0.009; PHQ-9 total score, with Pillai trace = 0.009, F(2593,7) = 3.26, p = 0.002; BMI, with Pillai trace = 0.008, F(2593,7) = 3.05, p = 0.003 and finally training load, with Pillai trace = 0.008, F(2593,7) = 2.94, p = 0.004. In subsequent ANOVA analysis, ID was always significant for all dependent variables; this implies that the nutrition pattern is a personal characteristic with a large effect size (eta squared = 0.211).\nFollow up univariate ANOVAs indicated that BMI (t = 1.97; p = 0.049), PHQ-9 (t = 2.83; p = 0.005) and PANAS positive (t = 3.01; p = 0.003) were positively correlated to Factor 1, whilst SF-12 (t = -2.88; p = 0.004) and gender (male = 0, female = 1; t = -4.96; p &lt; 0.001) was negatively correlated. Factor 2 was associated only with ID, as above reported. Considering Factor 3, gender (t = -2.61; p = 0.009), PANAS negative (t = -1.99; p = 0.046) and training load (t = -2.24; p = 0.025) showed negative correlations whilst BMI (t = 2.18; p = 0.030) showed positive one. Factor 4 was positively correlated only to training load (t = 2.88; p = 0.004). BMI (t = 2.48; p = 0.013), PHQ-9 (t = 2.06; p = 0.040) and PANAS positive (t = 2.11; p = 0.035) were positively correlated to Factor 5, whilst SF-12 (t = -1.98; p = 0.048) and gender (t = -2.11; p = 0.035) were negatively correlated. Factor 6 was positively correlated to PANAS negative (t = 2.57; p = 0.010) and training load (t = 2.13; p = 0.033) and negatively correlated to PHQ-9 (t = -2.31; p = 0.021). Finally, as Factor 2, Factor 7 was associated only with ID. These results are graphically presented in Figure 4.\n3.7. Mediation Effect\nThe mediation effect of exercise on psychometric scales has been investigated. As presented in the hypothetical model in Figure 5, we assumed that the influence of mood (psychometric scales) on the nutritional choices (factors above presented), might be mediated by the training load.\nThis analysis has been carried out with the mediation R package, with training load as mediating factor, psychometric scales (PHQ-9, PANAS +, PANAS - and SF-12 scores) as independent variables, and the seven factors as dependent variables. Firstly, the mediator has been regressed onto the independent variables; the training load was significantly correlated to each psychological scale (p &lt; 0.05). The effect of mood (measured through the psychometric scales) on nutritional choices (factors' scores) was mediated via the exercise performed, only for Factors 4 (fresh fruit and vegetable) and 6 (fish), as illustrated in Figure 6. For Factor 4, the mediation effect was -0.0014 (95% CI: -0.0029-0.00; p = 0.024) for PHQ-9 score, 0.0012 (95% CI: 0.0004-0.00; p &lt; 0.001) for PANAS positive score, 0.0008 (95% CI: 0.0002-0.00; p = 0.004) for PANAS negative score, and -0.0017 (95% CI: -0.0031-0.00; p &lt; 0.001) for SF-12 score. The proportion of the effect of the mood on Factor 4 that goes through the exercise was 2.7% for PHQ-9 (p = 0.024), 9.0% for PANAS positive (p &lt; 0.001), and 3.8% for PANAS negative (p = 0.004) scores respectively. The model accounted for 4.2% of the variance in Factor 4 (R2: 0.0417, p &lt; 0.001). For Factor 6, the mediation effect was -0.0018 (95% CI: -0.0039-0.00; p = 0.03) for PHQ-9 score, 0.0016 (95% CI: 0.0008-0.00; p &lt; 0.001) for PANAS positive score, 0.0011 (95% CI: 0.0002-0.00; p = 0.008) for PANAS negative score, and -0.0022 (95% CI: -0.0039-0.00; p &lt; 0.001) for SF-12 score. This means that the proportion of the effect of the PANAS positive scores on Factor 6 that goes through the exercise was 22.2% (p = 0.044). The model accounted for 1.8% of the variance in Factor 6 (R2: 0.0184, p &lt; 0.001).\n4. Discussion\nThis longitudinal observational study aimed to investigate the effects of mood states and exercise on nutritional choices during the COVID-19 home-confinement period. Based on the previous literature, it is known that both mood and exercise might affect nutritional choices. We assumed that these effects are not independent, but exercise might mediate the mood-food relationship, so determining changes in nutritional choices.\n4.1. Effect of Exercise on Nutrition\nThe combination of a healthy diet and physical exercise is the foundation of a healthy lifestyle. Exercise contributes to a negative energy balance by increasing energy expenditure, but the mechanisms which induce modifications in the dietary habits have not yet been completely elucidated. Indeed, research suggests that the role of physical exercise in stimulating psychosocial changes, which leads to better eating, might be more important than the effect of increased energy expenditure. It has been proposed that exercise could influence nutrition habits by application of self-regulatory conducts, improved mood states and increased self-efficacy, being suggested as a gateway behaviour for healthful eating. In our study, physical exercise has been shown to negatively correlate with Factor 3 and positively correlates to Factor 4 and 6. This means that in people who exercise more, have a higher consumption of fresh fruit, vegetable and fish, and a lower intake of fat-rich meats and milk-derivatives, the results suggest that physical exercise appears to mediate healthier dietary habits. This is in accordance with the results obtained by Donati Zeppa et al., which showed that nine weeks of high-intensity interval training promoted a spontaneous modulation of healthy food choices and regulation of dietary intake in young normal-weight college students, aged 21-24. Jayawardene et al. also highlighted that exercise could favour fruit and vegetable consumption in young adulthood. Romero-Blanco et al. conducted a study among university students during home-confinement due to COVID-19 in Spain, and evidenced a positive correlation between a Mediterranean diet (known to be rich in fruit and vegetables) and physical exercise. Physical exercise and healthy food choices seem to facilitate each other, via improved self-regulatory strategies and intentions (e.g., planning to perform physical exercise), indicating potential transfer effects between these behaviours. Although exercise has been observed to mainly influence fruit and vegetable consumption, it could be argued that the above-mentioned transfer effects may also influence other nutritional choices, such as increasing fish intake or limiting meats or milk-derivatives, known to be rich in saturated fats.\n4.2. Effect of Mood on Nutrition\nIn our sample, 13% of males and 19% of females reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 &gt;= 10), a result that is in accordance with the known higher prevalence of depression in women than in men. Quarantine situations have been evidenced to negatively impact on mental health, in particular by promoting insomnia, depression, anxiety, irritability, stress-related disorders and anger. Poorer mental health, a partial consequence of COVID-19 lockdown, possibly led to less healthy diets, which can themselves be linked to negative mood levels, such as anxiety and depression, in a vicious circle. Indeed, associations between diet and psychological disorders:such as depression and anxiety:have been previously reported.\nHigher scores on PHQ-9 (i.e., higher depression scores) are linked to a high intake of Factor 1 (mainly characterised by cereals and legumes) and Factor 5 (e.g., low-fat meats), and low consumption of Factor 6 (e.g., fish) consumption. The results of PHQ-9 scores are coherent with those reported for SF-12 (i.e., better quality of life), where higher scores were associated with lower consumption of Factor 1 and 5. There is a known link between mood and carbohydrates, with many people eating palatable high carbohydrate/high-fat foods when in a poor mood. Indeed, carbohydrate-rich foods could be a way of self-medicating depression, and the effect of carbohydrate cravings may be even stronger when people eat food with a high glycaemic index. A carbohydrate-rich meal tends to raise serotonin levels, which imbalance contributes to the development of depressive symptoms. Therefore, it would make sense that people with more severe depressive symptoms (likely associated with a lower perceived life quality) tend to have a diet rich in carbohydrates. Conversely, there is some, although controversial, evidence that eating fish might reduce the risk of depression. In general, the more enriched in fruits and vegetables and poorer in fat and in red meat a diet is, the lower the chance of showing symptoms of depression. However, people perceiving their quality of life as already good were less likely to consume foods popularly considered &quot;healthy&quot; since, in all likelihood, they did not feel the need of correcting with the diet their health or psychological status.\nFurthermore, higher scores in the positive affect scale (PANAS positive) were associated with a higher intake of Factor 1 and 5. This could be explained by the model proposed by Christensen L.: it has been proposed that there is a reciprocal interactive relationship between carbohydrate cravings and mood. Emotional distress causes a preference and craving for carbohydrate-rich foods, and these may have a positive reinforcing effect on mood, explaining the higher PANAS positive score. However, legumes consumption has been previously related to lower stress levels and better positive affects. Finally, although negative affect (PANAS negative scores) have been associated with a reduction in Factor 3 (i.e., high-fat meat and milk-derivatives) and an increase in Factor 6 (i.e., fish), research relating meat consumption with mood and life quality is inconclusive, with contrasting results; so, more research is needed to investigate these relationships. However, it might be suggested that this effect depends on a subgroup of people with modest depression preferring a diet with fish and less high-fat meat and milk-derivatives as a strategy to deal with their symptoms.\nDiet and mood can mutually influence each other through the gut-brain axis, in which the gut microbiome plays an important role in maintaining mental health. Brain areas and neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that are involved in both mood and appetite likely play a role in mediating this relationship.\n4.3. Exercise as a Mediator between Mood and Nutrition\nThe indirect effects of exercise on mood scales (PHQ-9, PANAS positive and negative, SF-12) and nutritional choices (factors) were studied using a mediation model. Although some other studies reported that changes in diet and physical exercise had a clear link to negative mood states, to the authors' knowledge only a few studies used a mediation approach to investigate this relationship. Results supported that exercise partially mediated the relationship between the four psychological domains (PHQ-9, PANAS positive and negative, SF-12) and the Factor 4 (fruit and vegetable consumption) and 6 (fish consumption). This is in accordance with the study published by Annesi et al., who claimed that changes in physical exercise mediated the relationships between mood and increased fruit and vegetable consumption. Mediation may still exist in the absence of a significant association between dependent and independent variables, as reported by MacKinnon et al.. Indeed, in our case, none of the psychological scales was associated with Factor 4, and only PHQ-9 and PANAS negative were associated with Factor 6, respectively, negatively and positively (Figure 4). MacKinnon et al. and Kenny described inconsistent mediation when the mediator acts as suppressor variable, in one of the following cases: indirect effect and total effect are opposite in sign, the estimate of the total effect is closer to zero than the direct effect, or the direct effect is larger than the total effect. Given the above, exercise could be a suppressor variable that buffers the interaction between SF-12 and Factor 4 and 6, PHQ-9 and PANAS negative and Factor 6. The mediation effects of exercise in the links of PHQ-9 and SF-12 on nutritional Factors might suggest that some participants actively changed their lifestyle to deal with the health and psychological anticipated impact of the lockdown and tried to prevent it by increasing their physical exercise and modifying their diets.\nThis work has some strengths and limitations. The main strength point is that diet monitoring was conducted for three-weeks using a 24 h recall method, instead of using simple surveys. Moreover, to our best knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to investigate the complicated relationship between dietary habits, psychological states and physical exercise using a mediation model. A limitation of the paper is that psychometric scales were collected only once during the monitoring period. Furthermore, we do not have data regarding the dietary habits pre-quarantine, which could have been useful in order to assess changes in nutrition and lifestyle behaviours consequent to the home-isolation. However, some effects of the Italian lockdown might reveal later than the short duration of this trial was able to observe. Another limitation is represented by the convenience sampling method, used for the recruitment of the participants. Future studies could focus on the psychological and physiological mechanisms underlying the changes in dietary habits following different training modalities.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper, the analysis of nutritional choices, physical exercise and mood in college students during COVID-19 outbreak highlighted the importance of physical exercise on dietary habits. Indeed, exercise showed to have both a direct effect, influencing fresh fruit and vegetables and fish consumption, and an indirect effect on nutritional choices, counterbalancing the impact of negative psychological states on the dietary habits. Poorer mental health possibly led to unhealthy diets, which can themselves be linked to negative mood levels, in a vicious circle. Overall, exercise led to healthier nutritional choices and, mediating the effects of mood states; it might represent a key measure in particular situations, such as a home-confinement due to a pandemic.\nPublisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nSupplementary Materials\nThe following are available online at .

0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: rapid review of the evidence","abstract":"The December, 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility.\n Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence.\n We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases.\n Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review.\n Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger.\n Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma.\n Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects.\n In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided.\n Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.\n","id":"PMC7158942","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Samantha K","surname":"Brooks","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rebecca K","surname":"Webster","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Louise E","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lisa","surname":"Woodland","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Wessely","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neil","surname":"Greenberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gideon James","surname":"Rubin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030371","date":"2020-01-30","title":"Impact of isolation on hospitalised patients who are infectious: systematic review with meta-analysis","abstract":"Objective\nTo systematically review the literature exploring the impact of isolation on hospitalised patients who are infectious: psychological and non-psychological outcomes.\n\n\nDesign\nSystematic review with meta-analysis.\n\n\nData sources\nEmbase, Medline and PsycINFO were searched from inception until December 2018.

the short WarwickEdinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS): findings from the Health Survey for England","abstract":"Purpose\nThe WarwickEdinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), 14 positively worded statements, is a validated instrument to measure mental wellbeing on a population level.\n\n Less is known about the population distribution of the shorter seven-item version (SWEMWBS) or its performance as an instrument to measure wellbeing.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing the Health Survey for England 20102013 (n = 27,169 adults aged 16+, nationally representative of the population), age- and sex-specific norms were estimated using means and percentiles.\n\n Criterion validity was examined using: (1) Spearman correlations (?) for SWEMWBS with General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), happiness index, EQ-VAS (2) a multinomial logit model with SWEMWBS (low, medium and high wellbeing) as the outcome and demographic, social and health behaviours as explanatory variables.\n\n Relative validity was examined by comparing SWEMWBS with WEMWBS using: (1) Spearman correlations (continuous data), and (2) the weighted kappa statistic (categorical), within population subgroups.\n\n\nResults\nMean (median) SWEMWBS was 23.7 (23.2) for men and 23.2 (23.2) for women (p = 0.100).\n\n Spearman correlations were moderately sized for the happiness index (? = 0.53, P &lt; 0.001), GHQ-12 (? = ?0.52, p &lt; 0.001) and EQ-VAS (? = 0.40, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Participants consuming &lt;1 portion of fruit and vegetables a day versus ?5 (odds ratio = 1.43 95% Confidence Interval = (1.221.66)) and current smokers versus non-smokers (1.28 (1.151.41)) were more likely to have low vs medium wellbeing.\n\n Participants who binge drank versus non-drinkers were less likely to have high versus medium wellbeing (0.81 (0.710.92)).\n\n Spearman correlations between SWEMWBS and WEMWBS were above 0.95; weighted kappa statistics showed almost perfect agreement (0.790.85).\n\n\nConclusion\nSWEMWBS distinguishes mental wellbeing between subgroups, similarly to WEMWBS, but is less sensitive to gender differences.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe

hampered by lack of valid measures that are responsive to change.\n\n The objective of this study was to evaluate the responsiveness of the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) at both the individual and group level.\n\n\nMethods\nSecondary analysis of twelve different interventional studies undertaken in different populations using WEMWBS as an outcome measure.\n\n Standardised response mean (SRM), probability of change statistic (P?) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were used to evaluate whether WEMWBS detected statistically important changes at the group and individual level, respectively.\n\n\nResults\nMean change in WEMWBS score ranged from ?0.6 to 10.6. SRM ranged from ?0.10 (95% CI: -0.35, 0.15) to 1.35 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.64).\n\n In 9/12 studies the lower limit of the 95% CI for P? was greater than 0.5, denoting responsiveness.\n\n SEM ranged from 2.4 to 3.1 units, and at the threshold 2.77 SEM, WEMWBS detected important improvement in at least 12.8% to 45.7% of participants (lower limit of 95% CI&gt;5.0%).\n\n\nConclusions\nWEMWBS is responsive to changes occurring in a wide range of mental health interventions undertaken in different populations.\n\n It offers a secure base for research and development in this rapidly evolving

Mechanisms","abstract":"Italy is one of the first European epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n In attempts to hinder the spread of the novel coronavirus disease, Italian government hardened protective measures, from quarantine to lockdown, impacting millions of lives dramatically.\n Amongst the enacted restrictions, all non-essential activities were prohibited as well as all outdoor activities banned.\n However, at the first spur of the outbreak, for about a dozen of days, physical and sports activities were permitted, while maintaining social distancing.\n In this timeframe, by administering measures coming from self-determination theory and theory of planned behavior and anxiety state, in an integrated approach, we investigated the prevalence of these activities by testing, via a Structural Equation Model, the influence of such psychosocial variables on the intention to preserve physical fitness during the healthcare emergency.\n Through an adequate fit of the hypothesized model and a multi-group analysis, we compared the most COVID-19 hit Italian region  Lombardy  to the rest of Italy, finding that anxiety was significantly higher in the Lombardy region than the rest of the country.\n In addition, anxiety negatively influenced the intention to do physical activity.\n Giving the potential deleterious effects of physical inactivity due to personal restrictions, these data may increase preparedness of public health measures and attractiveness of recommendations, including on the beneficial effects of exercise, under circumstances of social distancing to control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease.\n","id":"PMC7471606","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

behavior (e.\ng.\n, avoidance of air travel).\n The present study investigated psychological processes associated with Ebola-related anxiety and safety behaviors during the outbreak in late 2014. Between October 30 and December 3, 2014, which encompassed the peak of concerns and of the medias attention to this particular outbreak, 107 university students completed a battery of measures assessing fear of Ebola, performance of safety behaviors, factual knowledge of the virus, and psychological variables hypothesized to predict Ebola-related fear.\n We found that while our sample was generally not very fearful of contracting Ebola, the fear of this disease was correlated with general distress, contamination cognitions, disgust sensitivity, body vigilance, and anxiety sensitivity-related physical concerns.\n Regression analyses further indicated that anxiety sensitivity related to physical concerns and the tendency to overestimate the severity of contamination were unique predictors of both Ebola fear and associated safety behaviors.\n Implications for how concerns over serious illness outbreaks can be conceptualized and clinically managed are

to test the Integrated Behavior Change model in exercise and physical activity behaviors.\n The study evaluated two different samples of older adults: the first engaged in exercise class, the second doing spontaneous physical activity.\n The key analyses relied on Variance-Based Structural Modeling, which were performed by means of WARP PLS 6.0 statistical software.\n The analyses estimated the Integrated Behavior Change model in predicting exercise and physical activity, in a longitudinal design across two months of assessment.\n The tested models exhibited a good fit with the observed data derived from the model focusing on exercise, as well as with those derived from the model focusing on physical activity.\n Results showed, also, some effects and relations specific to each behavioral

Food security was assessed using a multistep approach that included the 2-item Food Sufficiency Screener and 6-Item USDA Food Security Survey Module (FSSM).\n Overall, 34.5% of respondents were classified as food insecure within the last 30 days.\n The strongest predictors of food insecurity were change in current living arrangement (OR = 2.70, 95% CI: 2.47, 2.95), being furloughed (OR = 3.22, 95% CI: 2.86, 3.64), laid off (OR = 4.07, 95% CI: 3.55, 4.66), or losing part-time work (OR = 5.73, 95% CI: 5.09, 6.46) due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n These findings highlight the high prevalence of food insecurity among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, with students who experienced housing insecurity and/or loss of income due to the pandemic being impacted the most.\n","id":"PMC7551032","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Meghan R.","surname":"Owens","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francilia","surname":"Brito-Silva","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tracie","surname":"Kirkland","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carolyn E.","surname":"Moore","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kathleen E.","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mindy A.","surname":"Patterson","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Mindy A.","surname":"Patterson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Derek C.","surname":"Miketinas","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Derek C.","surname":"Miketinas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wesley J.","surname":"Tucker","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wesley J.","surname":"Tucker","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1093/jn/131.4.1232","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Dietary intakes and serum nutrients differ between adults from food-insufficient and food-sufficient families: Third national health and nutrition examination survey, 1988-1994","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1093/jn/138.3.604","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Food insecurity is associated with nutrient inadequacies among Canadian adults and adolescents","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jand.2014.04.025","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Iron deficiency is associated with food insecurity in pregnant females in the United States: National health and nutrition examination survey 1999-2010","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2337/dc13-0570","date":"2013-04-18","title":"Food Insecurity and Metabolic Control Among U.S. Adults With Diabetes","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nWe sought to determine whether food insecurity is associated with worse glycemic, cholesterol, and blood pressure control in adults with diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from participants of the 19992008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\n\n All adults with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) by self-report or diabetes medication use were included.\n\n Food insecurity was measured by the Adult Food Security Survey Module.\n\n The outcomes of interest were proportion of patients with HbA1c &gt;9.0% (75 mmol/mol), LDL cholesterol &gt;100 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg.\n\n We used multivariable logistic regression for analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the 2,557 adults with diabetes in our sample, a higher proportion of those with food insecurity (27.0 vs.\n\n 13.3%, P &lt;

than the general population.\n Further qualitative and quantitative evaluations are needed to determine which assessment protocol is the most valid and reliable for use in accurately identifying FI in post-secondary students across the U.\nS.\n","id":"PMC6481800","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Cassandra

adults at enrolment in a food literacy program and to examine the relationship between food insecurity and a range of independent variables.\n Individuals attending the Food Sensations® for Adults program in Western Australia from May 2016 to April 2018 completed a pre-program questionnaire (n = 1433) indicating if they had run out of money for food in the past month (food insecurity indicator), frequency of food literacy behaviours, selected dietary behaviours, and demographic characteristics.\n The level of food insecurity reported by participants (n = 1379) was 40.5%.\n Results from multiple logistic regression demonstrated that behaviours related to planning and management, shopping, preparation, and cooking were all statistically independently associated with food insecurity, in addition to soft/soda drink consumption, education, employment status, and being born in Australia.\n The results are salient as they indicate an association between food literacy and food insecurity.\n The implications are that food insecure participants may respond differently to food literacy programs.\n It may be necessary to screen people enrolling in programs, tailor program

College Students Not Seeking Help? Predictors of and Barriers to Using an On-Campus Food Pantry","abstract":"Background: The number of food pantries on U.\nS.\n college campuses has increased in response to students food insecurity, but limited information is available to describe the impact of this resource.\n The objective of this cross-sectional investigation was to examine the relationship between food insecurity and food pantry awareness, use, and perceived barriers to use.\n Methods: Students attending the University of Florida in fall 2017 (n = 899) completed the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Adult Food Security Survey and responded to questions about food pantry awareness and use.\n Sociodemographic data were also collected and included in multivariate logistic regression models.\n Results: While most students (70%) were aware of the existing food pantry, nearly a third of respondents were classified as being food insecure.\n After adjusting for sociodemographic correlates, factors such as identifying as being food insecure, international status, and receiving a student loan or a need-based federal financial aid (Pell grant) increased the likelihood of utilizing the campus food pantry.\n Despite these predictors, only 38% of food insecure students reported food pantry use.\n Among students who provided qualitative insights, four main barriers to using the on-campus food pantry were identified: social stigma, insufficient information on pantry use policies, self-identity, and inconvenient hours.\n Conclusions: Food security interventions and administrative policy should consider a new model of the traditional campus food pantry that reduces concerns of social stigma and is supported by clear and ongoing communications of operational procedures tailored for the college student population.\n","id":"PMC6163327","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Aseel","surname":"El

Relatedly, the pandemic and accompanying social restrictions may deprive individuals of social support and adaptive coping strategies, thereby potentially elevating ED risk and symptoms by removing protective factors.\n Two, increased exposure to ED?specific or anxiety?provoking media, as well as increased reliance on video conferencing, may increase ED risk and symptoms.\n Three, fears of contagion may increase ED symptoms specifically related to health concerns, or by the pursuit of restrictive diets focused on increasing immunity.\n In addition, elevated rates of stress and negative affect due to the pandemic and social isolation may also contribute to increasing risk.\n Evaluating and assessing these factors are key to better understanding the impact of the pandemic on ED risk

Survey","abstract":"Background: Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home confinement.\n While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined.\n Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions.\n This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours.\n Methods: Following a structured review of the literature, the Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19) Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics.\n The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform.\n Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages.\n Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses before and during confinement conditions.\n Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis.\n The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall).\n Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day.\n Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly.\n Conclusion: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction.\n A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.\n","id":"PMC7352706","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Achraf","surname":"Ammar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Khaled","surname":"Trabelsi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamdi","surname":"Chtourou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Boukhris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liwa","surname":"Masmoudi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bassem","surname":"Bouaziz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ellen","surname":"Bentlage","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniella","surname":"How","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Notger","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Asma","surname":"Aloui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Hammouda","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laisa

time in children is not only due to screen media use: a cross-sectional study","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Sedentary behaviour has become a growing public health concern.\n\n Currently, it is a common belief that screen time (SCT) is a key factor in high overall sedentary time (ST) and is often used as a primary outcome.\n\n However, the evidence is lacking.\n\n Therefore, this study investigated the association of objectively assessed total ST with SCT among children.\n\n Further, SCT was investigated separately for sedentary level, weight status, gender, and migration background.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>For 198 primary school children (7.1?±?0.7?years, boys: 43.9%) ST was assessed objectively using a multi-sensor device (Actiheart®; CamNtech, Cambridge, UK).\n\n The sample was split into three groups (tertiles) to investigate SCT of children with low, medium and high ST.\n\n SCT and socio-demographic parameters, such as migration background, were assessed using a parental questionnaire; anthropometric data was collected at schools.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Absolut SCT did not differ significantly among the three sedentary groups: Daily average of SCT was 83.8?±?55.0?min (27.4% of ST) for children with high ST, 82.8?±?50.5?min (39.8% of ST) for children with medium ST, and 77.2?±?59.4?min (71.3% of ST) for those with low ST.\n\n However, relatively the SCT percentage of total ST was significantly higher among children with low ST (p?&lt;?0.01).\n\n Significantly higher SCT was found in children with migration background (p?&lt;?0.01), while underweight children had significantly less SCT (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n An association of total SCT and overall ST was found for the whole sample (B?=?17.11, [2.75; 31.48], p?=?0.02), but did not remain when analysis were separated for the groups, except for normal weight children (B?=?15.97, [0.13; 31.81], p?=?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>The amount of SCT is the same among high, low and medium sedentary children, and high ST is largely independent of SCT.\n\n Therefore, SCT cannot be the key contributor to high ST and should not solely be used for predicting or changing childrens sedentary behaviour.\n\n Moreover, childrens weight status to classify activity levels and the role of possible compensation mechanisms should be considered in future research and when trying to intervene on ST.\n\n\nTrial registration\nid='Par5'>German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS), DRKS-ID: DRKS00000494 DATE:

the short WarwickEdinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS): findings from the Health Survey for England","abstract":"Purpose\nThe WarwickEdinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), 14 positively worded statements, is a validated instrument to measure mental wellbeing on a population level.\n\n Less is known about the population distribution of the shorter seven-item version (SWEMWBS) or its performance as an instrument to measure wellbeing.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing the Health Survey for England 20102013 (n = 27,169 adults aged 16+, nationally representative of the population), age- and sex-specific norms were estimated using means and percentiles.\n\n Criterion validity was examined using: (1) Spearman correlations (?) for SWEMWBS with General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), happiness index, EQ-VAS (2) a multinomial logit model with SWEMWBS (low, medium and high wellbeing) as the outcome and demographic, social and health behaviours as explanatory variables.\n\n Relative validity was examined by comparing SWEMWBS with WEMWBS using: (1) Spearman correlations (continuous data), and (2) the weighted kappa statistic (categorical), within population subgroups.\n\n\nResults\nMean (median) SWEMWBS was 23.7 (23.2) for men and 23.2 (23.2) for women (p = 0.100).\n\n Spearman correlations were moderately sized for the happiness index (? = 0.53, P &lt; 0.001), GHQ-12 (? = ?0.52, p &lt; 0.001) and EQ-VAS (? = 0.40, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Participants consuming &lt;1 portion of fruit and vegetables a day versus ?5 (odds ratio = 1.43 95% Confidence Interval = (1.221.66)) and current smokers versus non-smokers (1.28 (1.151.41)) were more likely to have low vs medium wellbeing.\n\n Participants who binge drank versus non-drinkers were less likely to have high versus medium wellbeing (0.81 (0.710.92)).\n\n Spearman correlations between SWEMWBS and WEMWBS were above 0.95; weighted kappa statistics showed almost perfect agreement (0.790.85).\n\n\nConclusion\nSWEMWBS distinguishes mental wellbeing between subgroups, similarly to WEMWBS, but is less sensitive to gender differences.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe

recommended as a cost-effective method to assess physical activity.\n\n Several studies validating the IPAQ-SF have been conducted with differing results, but no systematic review of these studies has been reported.\n\n\nMethods\nThe keywords 'IPAQ', 'validation', and 'validity' were searched in PubMed and Scopus.\n\n Studies published in English that validated the IPAQ-SF against an objective physical activity measuring device, doubly labeled water, or an objective fitness measure were included.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-three validation studies were included in this review.\n\n There was a great deal of variability in the methods used across studies, but the results were largely similar.\n\n Correlations between the total physical activity level measured by the IPAQ-SF and objective standards ranged from 0.09 to 0.39; none reached the minimal acceptable standard in the literature (0.50 for objective activity measuring devices, 0.40 for fitness measures).\n\n Correlations between sections of the IPAQ-SF for vigorous activity or moderate activity level/walking and an objective standard showed even greater variability (-0.18 to 0.76), yet several reached the minimal acceptable standard.\n\n Only six studies provided comparisons between physical activity levels derived from the IPAQ-SF and those obtained from objective criterion.\n\n In most studies the IPAQ-SF overestimated physical activity level by 36 to 173 percent; one study underestimated by 28 percent.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe correlation between the IPAQ-SF and objective measures of activity or fitness in the large majority of studies was lower than the acceptable standard.\n\n Furthermore, the IPAQ-SF typically overestimated physical activity as measured by objective criterion by an average of 84 percent.\n\n Hence, the evidence to support the use of the IPAQ-SF as an indicator of relative or absolute physical activity is weak.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3214824","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

the Tunisian case and lessons for global epidemics in the context of 3PM strategies","abstract":"id='Par1'>Covid-19 is neither the first nor the last viral epidemic which societies around the world are, were and will be affected by.\n Which lessons should be taken from the current pandemic situation? The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterised, and many research teams all over the world are working on prediction of the epidemic scenario, protective measures to populations and sub-populations, therapeutic and vaccination issues, amongst others.\n Contextually, countries with currently low numbers of Covid-19-infected individuals such as Tunisia are intended to take lessons from those countries which already reached the exponential phase of the infection distribution as well as from those which have the exponential phase behind them and record a minor number of new cases such as China.\n To this end, in Tunisia, the pandemic wave has started with a significant delay compared with Europe, the main economic partner of the country.\n In this paper, we do analyse the current pandemic situation in this country by studying the infection evolution and considering potential protective strategies to prevent a pandemic scenario.\n The model is predictive based on a large number of undetected Covid-19 cases that is particularly true for some country regions such as Sfax.\n Infection distribution and mortality rate analysis demonstrate a highly heterogeneous picture over the country.\n Qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis leads to a conclusion that the reliable real-time monitoring based on the randomised laboratory tests is the optimal predictive strategy to create the most effective evidence-based preventive measures.\n In contrast, lack of tests may lead to incorrect political decisions causing either unnecessary over-protection of the population that is risky for a long-term economic recession, or under-protection of the population leading to a post-containment pandemic rebound.\n Recommendations are provided in the context of advanced predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medical approach.\n","id":"PMC7182506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer International

anxiety symptoms and anger in persons isolated during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic both at isolation period and at four to six months after release from isolation.\n\n We also determined risk factors associated with these symptoms at four to six months.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOf 14,992 individuals isolated for 2-week due to having contact with MERS patients in 2015, when MERS was introduced to Korea, 1,692 individuals were included in this study.\n\n Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and anger was assessed with the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory at four to six months after release from isolation for MERS.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 1,692 who came in contact with MERS patients, 1,656 were not diagnosed with MERS.\n\n Among 1,656, anxiety symptoms showed 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3 to 8.9%) and feelings of anger were present in 16.6% (95% CI, 14.8 to 18.4%) during the isolation period.\n\n At four to six months after release from isolation, anxiety symptoms were observed in 3.0% (95%CI, 2.2 to 3.9%).\n\n Feelings of anger were present in 6.4% (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.6%).\n\n Risk factors for experiencing anxiety symptoms and anger at four to six months after release included symptoms related to MERS during isolation, inadequate supplies (food, clothes, accommodation), social networking activities (email, text, Internet), history of psychiatric illnesses, and financial loss.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMental health problems at four to six month after release from isolation might be prevented by providing mental health support to individuals with vulnerable mental health, and providing accurate information as well as appropriate supplies, including food, clothes, and accommodation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5177805","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Korean Society of

Physical activity was impacted for both sexes during the pandemic with ~30% fewer students achieving sufficient levels of activity, defined by at least 150 min over at least five sessions, compared with the previous two years.\n In a follow-up study six to eight weeks later (1418% response rate), during gradual easing of nationwide restrictions albeit continued gym closures and online learning, higher energy intake in females and reduced physical activity levels in both sexes persisted.\n These data demonstrate the health impacts of isolation measures, with the potential to affect long-term

China and received worldwide attention.\n On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern.\n The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century.\n As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO.\n Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to ?-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host.\n The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract.\n Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe.\n The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms.\n The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm.\n Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.\n In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.\n","id":"PMC7068984","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

physical activity, and self-determination theory: A systematic review","abstract":"Background\nMotivation is a critical factor in supporting sustained exercise, which in turn is associated with important health outcomes.\n\n Accordingly, research on exercise motivation from the perspective of self-determination theory (SDT) has grown considerably in recent years.\n\n Previous reviews have been mostly narrative and theoretical.\n\n Aiming at a more comprehensive review of empirical data, this article examines the empirical literature on the relations between key SDT-based constructs and exercise and physical activity behavioral outcomes.\n\n\nMethods\nThis systematic review includes 66 empirical studies published up to June 2011, including experimental, cross-sectional, and prospective studies that have measured exercise causality orientations, autonomy/need support and need satisfaction, exercise motives (or goal contents), and exercise self-regulations and motivation.\n\n We also studied SDT-based interventions aimed at increasing exercise behavior.\n\n In all studies, actual or self-reported exercise/physical activity, including attendance, was analyzed as the dependent variable.\n\n Findings are summarized based on quantitative analysis of the evidence.\n\n\nResults\nThe results show consistent support for a positive relation between more autonomous forms of motivation and exercise, with a trend towards identified regulation predicting initial/short-term adoption more strongly than intrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation being more predictive of long-term exercise adherence.\n\n The literature is also consistent in that competence satisfaction and more intrinsic motives positively predict exercise participation across a range of samples and settings.\n\n Mixed evidence was found concerning the role of other types of motives (e.\n\ng.\n\n, health/fitness and body-related), and also the specific nature and consequences of introjected regulation.\n\n The majority of studies have employed descriptive (i.\n\ne.\n\n, non-experimental) designs but similar results are found across cross-sectional, prospective, and experimental designs.\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, the literature provides good evidence for the value of SDT in understanding exercise behavior, demonstrating the importance of autonomous (identified and intrinsic) regulations in fostering physical activity.\n\n Nevertheless, there remain some inconsistencies and mixed evidence with regard to the relations between specific SDT constructs and exercise.\n\n Particular limitations concerning the different associations explored in the literature are discussed in the context of refining the application of SDT to exercise and physical activity promotion, and integrating these with avenues for future research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3441783","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Pedro

of sleep as a contributor to obesity in adolescents: impacts on eating and activity behaviors","abstract":"Background\nSleep is an important contributor to physical and mental health; however, chronic sleep deprivation has become common in adolescents, especially on weekdays.\n\n Adolescents aged 1417 years are recommended to sleep between 8 and 10 h per night to maximize overall health and well-being.\n\n Although sleep needs may vary between individuals, sleep duration recommendations are important for surveillance and help inform policies, interventions, and the population of healthy sleep behaviors.\n\n Long sleepers are very rare among teenagers and sleeping too much is not a problem per se; only insufficient sleep is associated with adverse health outcomes in the pediatric population.\n\n Causes of insufficient sleep are numerous and chronic sleep deprivation poses a serious threat to the academic success, health and safety of adolescents.\n\n This article focuses on the link between insufficient sleep and obesity in adolescents.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis call to action article argues that sleep should be taken more seriously by the public health community and by our society in general, i.\n\ne.\n\n, given as much attention and resources as nutrition and physical activity.\n\n Not only that having a good nights sleep is as important as eating a healthy diet and being regularly physically active for overall health, but sleeping habits also impact eating and screen time behaviors and, therefore, can influence body weight control.\n\n\nSummary\nShort sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and late bedtimes are all associated with excess food intake, poor diet quality, and obesity in adolescents.\n\n Sleep, sedentary behavior, physical activity and diet all interact and influence each other to ultimately impact health.\n\n A holistic approach to health (i.\n\ne.\n\n, the whole day matters) targeting all of these behaviors synergistically is needed to optimize the impact of our interventions.\n\n Sleep is not a waste of time and sleep hygiene is an important factor to consider in the prevention and treatment of

cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n Among these behaviors, sleep may play a pivotal role, yet it has been studied somewhat less than other behaviors and there have been few well-designed sleep intervention studies targeting CVD.\n Furthermore, despite the fact that these behaviors are often interrelated, interventions tend to focus on changing one health behavior rather than concurrently intervening on multiple behaviors.\n Psychological constructs from depression to positive affect may also have a major effect on these health behaviors and ultimately on CVD.\n In this review, we summarize the existing literature on the impact of sleep and other cardiac health behaviors on CVD onset and prognosis.\n We also describe interventions that may promote these behaviors, from established interventions such as motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy, to more novel approaches focused on mindfulness and other positive psychological constructs.\n Finally, we outline population-health-level care management approaches for patients with psychiatric conditions (e.\ng.\n, depression) that may impact cardiac health, and discuss their potential utility in improving mental health, promoting health behaviors, and reducing CVD-related risk.\n Much work is still needed to better understand how sleep and other health behaviors may uniquely contribute to CVD risk, and additional high-quality studies of interventions designed to modify cardiac health behaviors are required to improve cardiovascular health in individuals and the population at

recommended as a cost-effective method to assess physical activity.\n\n Several studies validating the IPAQ-SF have been conducted with differing results, but no systematic review of these studies has been reported.\n\n\nMethods\nThe keywords 'IPAQ', 'validation', and 'validity' were searched in PubMed and Scopus.\n\n Studies published in English that validated the IPAQ-SF against an objective physical activity measuring device, doubly labeled water, or an objective fitness measure were included.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-three validation studies were included in this review.\n\n There was a great deal of variability in the methods used across studies, but the results were largely similar.\n\n Correlations between the total physical activity level measured by the IPAQ-SF and objective standards ranged from 0.09 to 0.39; none reached the minimal acceptable standard in the literature (0.50 for objective activity measuring devices, 0.40 for fitness measures).\n\n Correlations between sections of the IPAQ-SF for vigorous activity or moderate activity level/walking and an objective standard showed even greater variability (-0.18 to 0.76), yet several reached the minimal acceptable standard.\n\n Only six studies provided comparisons between physical activity levels derived from the IPAQ-SF and those obtained from objective criterion.\n\n In most studies the IPAQ-SF overestimated physical activity level by 36 to 173 percent; one study underestimated by 28 percent.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe correlation between the IPAQ-SF and objective measures of activity or fitness in the large majority of studies was lower than the acceptable standard.\n\n Furthermore, the IPAQ-SF typically overestimated physical activity as measured by objective criterion by an average of 84 percent.\n\n Hence, the evidence to support the use of the IPAQ-SF as an indicator of relative or absolute physical activity is weak.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3214824","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

popularly used in assessing the subjective quality of life (QOL) of patients and the general public.\n\n We examined its psychometric properties in a large sample of community residents in mainland China.\n\n\nMethods\nThe WHOQOL-BREF was administered to 1052 adult community residents in a major metropolitan city in southern China.\n\n The structural integrity of the 4-factor model in confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and the relationship of QOL with demographic variables were examined.\n\n Validity was assessed using the known-group comparison (229 with vs.\n\n 823 without chronic illness), item-domain correlations, and CFA using the ML estimation in LISREL.\n\n\nResults\nInternal consistency reliability of the whole instrument (26 items) was 0.89, and the psychological, social, and environment domains had acceptable reliability (alpha = 0.76, 0.72, 0.78 respectively), while that of the physical domain was slightly lower (? = 0.67).\n\n The respective mean scores of these domains were 13.69, 14.11, 12.33 and 14.56. Item-domain correlations were much higher for corresponding domains than for non-corresponding domains, indicating good convergent validity.\n\n CFA provided a marginally acceptable fit to the a priori four-factor model when two matching content item pairs were allowed to be correlated; ?2 (244) = 1836, RMSEA = 0.088, NNFI = 0.898, CFI = 0.909. This factorial structure was shown to be equivalent between the participants with and without chronic illness.\n\n The differences in means between these two groups were significant but small in some domains; effect size = 0.55, 0.15, 0.18 in the physical, psychological, and social relationship domains respectively.\n\n Furthermore, males had significantly higher QOL scores than females in the psychological domain, while individuals with a younger age, higher income, and higher education levels also had significantly higher QOL.\n\n Compared with the international data, the Chinese in this study had relatively low QOL scores with about 5% of males and 16% of females being at risk for poor QOL.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study has provided psychometric properties of the WHOQOL-BREF as used in China and should definitely be useful for researchers who would like to use or further refine the instrument.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3364902","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Xia","email":"xiaping1976@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ningxiu","surname":"Li","email":"liningxiu@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kit-Tai","surname":"Hau","email":"kthau@cuhk.edu.hk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chaojie","surname":"Liu","email":"c.liu@latrobe.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yubo","surname":"Lu","email":"lyuanzhang@126.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Shanghai Statistical Yearbook","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"How does housing supply satisfy the differentiated demand of tenants and homebuyers in the new era? evidence from shanghai","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ypmed.2012.05.003","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Associations of physical activity and screen-time on health related quality of life in adults","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cjca.2015.12.006","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Physical activity, sedentary behaviours, and cardiovascular health: When will cardiorespiratory fitness become a vital sign?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/GME.0000000000000575","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Sedentary lifestyle in middle-aged women is associated with severe menopausal symptoms and obesity","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.03.026","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Sedentary behavior and indicators of mental health in school-aged children and adolescents: A systematic review","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jshs.2016.07.007","date":"2016-04-25","title":"The impact of weather on summer and winter exercise behaviors","abstract":"Background\nOutdoor exercise is an enjoyable way for individuals to improve fitness, but it is dependent on weather conditions.\n\n This study examines the association between weather conditions and outdoor exercise after adjustment for age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data representative of American adults from the University of Michigan/Thomson Reuters June 2013 surveys of consumers (core and supplement) to investigate self-reported exercise behavior in summer and winter.\n\n Multivariate multinomial logistic regression models estimated the odds of delayed or indoor exercise compared with outdoor exercise.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 502 respondents, 16.3% did not regularly exercise outdoors (i.\n\ne.\n\n, at least once a week), and many would delay exercise both in summer (51.8%) and winter (43.9%).\n\n Individuals listing rain as the predominant adverse weather condition had 3.33 times higher odds of exercising indoors (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.348.28) and 3.49 times higher odds of delaying exercise (95%CI: 1.697.21) compared with those mentioning heat as the predominant adverse condition.\n\n Individuals for whom ice or snow was an adverse winter weather condition were more likely to delay exercise (odds ratio (OR)?=?3.34;

a\nsystematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies","abstract":"id='Par1'>With depression being the psychiatric disorder incurring the largest\nsocietal costs in developed countries, there is a need to gather evidence on the\nrole of nutrition in depression, to help develop recommendations and guide future\npsychiatric health care.\n The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the\nlink between diet quality, measured using a range of predefined indices, and\ndepressive outcomes.\n Medline, Embase and PsychInfo were searched up to\n31st May 2018 for studies that examined adherence to a\nhealthy diet in relation to depressive symptoms or clinical depression.\n Where\npossible, estimates were pooled using random effect meta-analysis with\nstratification by observational study design and dietary score.\n A total of 20\nlongitudinal and 21 cross-sectional studies were included.\n These studies utilized an\narray of dietary measures, including: different measures of adherence to the\nMediterranean diet, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Alternative HEI (AHEI), the\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, and the Dietary Inflammatory Index.\n The\nmost compelling evidence was found for the Mediterranean diet and incident\ndepression, with a combined relative risk estimate of highest vs.\n lowest adherence\ncategory from four longitudinal studies of 0.67 (95% CI 0.550.82).\n A lower Dietary\nInflammatory Index was also associated with lower depression incidence in four\nlongitudinal studies (relative risk 0.76; 95% CI: 0.630.92).\n There were fewer\nlongitudinal studies using other indices, but they and cross-sectional evidence also\nsuggest an inverse association between healthy diet and depression (e.\ng.\n, relative\nrisk 0.65; 95% CI 0.500.84 for HEI/AHEI).\n To conclude, adhering to a healthy diet,\nin particular a traditional Mediterranean diet, or avoiding a pro-inflammatory diet\nappears to confer some protection against depression in observational studies.\n This\nprovides a reasonable evidence base to assess the role of dietary interventions to\nprevent depression.\n This systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO\nInternational Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews under the number\nCRD42017080579.","id":"PMC6755986","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

metabolic syndrome (MetS).\n\n\nDesign\nWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of tree nuts on criteria of the MetS.\n\n\nData sources\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library (through 4 April 2014).\n\n\nEligibility criteria for selecting studies\nWe included relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ?3?weeks reporting at least one criterion of the MetS.\n\n\nData extraction\nTwo or more independent reviewers extracted all relevant data.\n\n Data were pooled using the generic inverse variance method using random effects models and expressed as mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs.\n\n Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic.\n\n Study quality and risk of bias were assessed.\n\n\nResults\nEligibility criteria were met by 49 RCTs including 2226 participants who were otherwise healthy or had dyslipidaemia, MetS or type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n Tree nut interventions lowered triglycerides (MD=?0.06?mmol/L (95% CI ?0.09 to ?0.03?mmol/L)) and fasting blood glucose (MD=?0.08?mmol/L (95% CI ?0.16 to ?0.01?mmol/L)) compared with control diet interventions.\n\n There was no effect on waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or blood pressure with the direction of effect favouring tree nuts for waist circumference.\n\n There was evidence of significant unexplained heterogeneity in all analyses (p&lt;0.05).\n\n\nConclusions\nPooled analyses show a MetS benefit of tree nuts through modest decreases in triglycerides and fasting blood glucose with no adverse effects on other criteria across nut types.\n\n As our conclusions are limited by the short duration and poor quality of the majority of trials, as well as significant unexplained between-study heterogeneity, there remains a need for larger, longer, high-quality trials.\n\n\nTrial registration

of Nut Consumption","abstract":" Nuts (tree nuts and peanuts) are nutrient dense foods with complex matrices rich in unsaturated fatty and other bioactive compounds: high-quality vegetable protein, fiber, minerals, tocopherols, phytosterols, and phenolic compounds.\n By virtue of their unique composition, nuts are likely to beneficially impact health outcomes.\n Epidemiologic studies have associated nut consumption with a reduced incidence of coronary heart disease and gallstones in both genders and diabetes in women.\n Limited evidence also suggests beneficial effects on hypertension, cancer, and inflammation.\n Interventional studies consistently show that nut intake has a cholesterol-lowering effect, even in the context of healthy diets, and there is emerging evidence of beneficial effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular reactivity.\n Blood pressure, visceral adiposity and the metabolic syndrome also appear to be positively influenced by nut consumption.\n Thus it is clear that nuts have a beneficial impact on many cardiovascular risk factors.\n Contrary to expectations, epidemiologic studies and clinical trials suggest that regular nut consumption is unlikely to contribute to obesity and may even help in weight loss.\n Safety concerns are limited to the infrequent occurrence of nut allergy in children.\n In conclusion, nuts are nutrient rich foods with wide-ranging cardiovascular and metabolic benefits, which can be readily incorporated into healthy

intervention based on this dietary pattern could provide the most definitive answer to the findings reported by observational studies.\n\n The aim of this study was to compare in a randomized trial the effects of two Mediterranean diets versus a low-fat diet on depression risk after at least 3 years of intervention.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a multicenter, randomized, primary prevention field trial of cardiovascular disease (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED Study)) based on community-dwelling men aged 55 to 80 years and women aged 60 to 80 years at high risk of cardiovascular disease (51% of them had type 2 diabetes; DM2) attending primary care centers affiliated with 11 Spanish teaching hospitals.\n\n Primary analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\n Cox regression models were used to assess the relationship between the nutritional intervention groups and the incidence of depression.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 224 new cases of depression during follow-up.\n\n There was an inverse association with depression for participants assigned to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts (multivariate hazard ratio (HR) 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.10) compared with participants assigned to the control group, although this was not significant.\n\n However, when the analysis was restricted to participants with DM2, the magnitude of the effect of the intervention with the Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts did reach statistical significance (multivariate HR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.98).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe result suggest that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts could exert a beneficial effect on the risk of depression in patients with DM2.\nTrial registration\nThis trial has been registered in the Current Controlled Trials with the number ISRCTN 35739639\n","id":"PMC3848350","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

correlation between intake of oily fish and depression or bipolar disorders.\n Studies conducted specifically on the association between omega-3 intake and depression reported contrasting results, suggesting that the preventive role of omega-3 PUFA may depend also on other factors, such as overall diet quality and the social environment.\n Accordingly, tertiary prevention with omega-3 PUFA supplement in depressed patients has reached greater effectiveness during the last recent years, although definitive statements on their use in depression therapy cannot be yet freely asserted.\n Among the biological properties of omega-3 PUFA, their anti-inflammatory effects and their important role on the structural changing of the brain should be taken into account to better understand the possible pathway through which they can be effective both in preventing or treating depression.\n However, the problem of how to correct the inadequate supply of omega-3 PUFA in the Westernized countries' diet is a priority in order to set food and health policies and also dietary recommendations for individuals and population

2) P-value adjustments reduce the chance of making type I errors, but they increase the chance of making type II errors or needing to increase the sample size.\n\n\nSummary\nReaders should balance a study's statistical significance with the magnitude of effect, the quality of the study and with findings from other studies.\n\n Researchers facing multiple outcome measures might want to either select a primary outcome measure or use a global assessment measure, rather than adjusting the p-value.\n\n\n","id":"PMC117123","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Ronald J","surname":"Feise","email":"rjf@chiroevidence.com","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s10865-016-9809-8","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Future directions of multiple behavior change research","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s12529-009-9032-x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The relationship between life satisfaction and health behavior: A cross-cultural analysis of young adults","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41366-018-0299-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Influence of 15-week Exercise Training on Dietary Patterns among Young Adults","abstract":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES:\nid='P1'>Little is currently known about how exercise may influence dietary patterns and/or food preferences.\n\n The present study aimed to examine the effect of a 15-week exercise training program on overall dietary patterns among young adults.\n\n\nSUBJECTS/METHODS:\nid='P2'>This study consisted of 2680 young adults drawn from the Training Intervention and Genetics of Exercise Response (TIGER) study.\n\n Subjects underwent 15 weeks of aerobic exercise training, and exercise duration, intensity, and dose were recorded for each session using computerized heart rate monitors.\n\n In total, 4355 dietary observations with 102 food items were collected using a self-administered food frequency questionnaire before and after exercise training (n = 2476 at baseline; n = 1859 at 15 weeks).\n\n Dietary patterns were identified using a Bayesian sparse latent factor model.\n\n Changes in dietary pattern preferences were evaluated based on the pre/post-training differences in dietary pattern scores, accounting for the effects of gender, race/ethnicity, and BMI.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nid='P3'>Within each of the seven dietary patterns identified, most dietary pattern scores were decreased following exercise training, consistent with increased voluntary regulation of food intake.\n\n A longer duration of exercise was associated with decreased preferences for the Western (?: ?0.0793;

results from appetite suppression in the post-exercise state.\n The timing of food choicechoosing for immediate or later consumptionhas been found to influence the healthfulness of foods consumed.\n To examine both of these effects, we tested in our study whether the timing of food choice interacts with exposure to exercise to impact food choices such that choices would differ when made prior to or following an exercise bout.\n Visitors to a university recreational center were equipped with an accelerometer prior to their habitual workout regime, masking the true study purpose.\n As a reward, participants were presented with a snack for consumption after workout completion.\n Participants made their snack choice from either an apple or chocolate brownie after being pseudo-randomly assigned to choose prior to (before) or following workout completion (after).\n Complete data were available for 256 participants (54.7% male, 22.1 ± 3.1 years, 24.7 ± 3.7 kg/m2) who exercised 65.3 ± 22.5

Influence of 15-week Exercise Training on Dietary Patterns among Young Adults","abstract":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES:\nid='P1'>Little is currently known about how exercise may influence dietary patterns and/or food preferences.\n\n The present study aimed to examine the effect of a 15-week exercise training program on overall dietary patterns among young adults.\n\n\nSUBJECTS/METHODS:\nid='P2'>This study consisted of 2680 young adults drawn from the Training Intervention and Genetics of Exercise Response (TIGER) study.\n\n Subjects underwent 15 weeks of aerobic exercise training, and exercise duration, intensity, and dose were recorded for each session using computerized heart rate monitors.\n\n In total, 4355 dietary observations with 102 food items were collected using a self-administered food frequency questionnaire before and after exercise training (n = 2476 at baseline; n = 1859 at 15 weeks).\n\n Dietary patterns were identified using a Bayesian sparse latent factor model.\n\n Changes in dietary pattern preferences were evaluated based on the pre/post-training differences in dietary pattern scores, accounting for the effects of gender, race/ethnicity, and BMI.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nid='P3'>Within each of the seven dietary patterns identified, most dietary pattern scores were decreased following exercise training, consistent with increased voluntary regulation of food intake.\n\n A longer duration of exercise was associated with decreased preferences for the Western (?: ?0.0793; 95% credible interval: ?0.1568, ?0.0017) and Snacking (?: ?0.1280; 95% credible interval: ?0.1877, ?0.0637) patterns, while a higher intensity of exercise was linked to an increased preference for the Prudent pattern (?: 0.0623; 95% credible interval: 0.0159, 0.1111).\n\n Consequently, a higher dose of exercise was related to a decreased preference for the Snacking pattern (?: ?0.0023; 95% credible interval: ?0.0042, ?0.0004) and an increased preference for the Prudent pattern (?: 0.0029; 95% credible interval: 0.0009, 0.0048).\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\nid='P4'>The 15-week exercise training appeared to motivate young adults to pursue healthier dietary preferences and to

acid-alanine-carbohydrate-based sports supplement on perceived exertion and performance in high intensity endurance cycling tests","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Sports nutritional supplements containing branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have been widely reported to improve psychological and biological aspects connected to central fatigue and performance in endurance exercise, although the topic is still open to debate.\n\n The aim of the present study was to determine whether the intake of a commercially available BCAA-based supplement, taken according to the manufacturers recommendations, could affect the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and performance indexes at the beginning (1d) and end of a 9-week (9w) scheduled high intensity interval training program, with an experimental approach integrating the determination of psychometric, performance, metabolic and blood biochemical parameters.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>This was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.\n\n Thirty-two untrained, healthy young adults (20 males and 12 female) were enrolled.\n\n A high-intensity endurance cycling (HIEC) test was used to induce fatigue in the participants: HIEC consisted in ten 90?s sprints interspersed by ten 3?min recovery phases and followed by a final step time to exhaustion was used.\n\n In parallel with RPE, haematological values (creatine kinase, alanine, BCAA, tryptophan, ammonia and glucose levels), and performance indexes (maximal oxygen consumption - VO2max, power associated with lactate thresholds - WLT1, WLT2 and time to exhaustion - TTE) were assessed.\n\n All subject took the supplement (13.2?g of carbohydrates; 3.2?g of BCAA and 1.6?g of L-alanine per dose) or placebo before each test and training session.\n\n Dietary habits and training load were monitored during the entire training period.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The administration of the supplement (SU) at 1d reduced RPE by 9% during the recovery phase, as compared to the placebo (PL); at 9w the RPE scores were reduced by 13 and 21% during the sprint and recovery phase, respectively; at 9w, prolonged supplement intake also improved TTE and TRIMP.\n\n SU intake invariably promoted a rapid increase (within 1?h) of BCAA serum blood levels and prevented the post-HIEC tryptophan: BCAA ratio increase found in the PL group, at both 1d and 9w.\n\n There was no difference in dietary habits between groups and those habits did not change over time; no difference in glycemia was found between SU and PL.\n\n VO2max, WLT1 and WLT2 values improved over time, but were unaffected by supplement intake.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>On the whole, these results suggest that i) the intake of the BCAA-based commercially available supplement used in this study reduces RPE as a likely consequence of an improvement in the serum tryptophan: BCAA ratio; ii) over time, reduced RPE allows subjects to sustain higher workloads, leading to increased TRIMP and TTE.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6971972","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

continuous moderate intensity training (MIT) for improving body composition, insulin sensitivity (SI), blood pressure, blood lipids, and cardiovascular fitness in a cohort of sedentary overweight or obese young men.\n\n We hypothesized that HIIT would result in similar improvements in body composition, cardiovascular fitness, blood lipids, and SI as compared to the MIT group, despite requiring only one hour of activity per week compared to five hours per week for the MIT group.\n\n\nMethods\n28 sedentary overweight or obese men (age, 20 ± 1.5 years, body mass index 29.5 ± 3.3 kg/m2) participated in a six week exercise treatment.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned to HIIT or MIT and evaluated at baseline and post-training.\n\n DXA was used to assess body composition, graded treadmill exercise test to measure cardiovascular fitness, oral glucose tolerance to measure SI, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess lipoprotein particles, and automatic auscultation to measure blood pressure.\n\n\nResults\nA greater improvement in VO2peak was observed in MIT compared to HIIT (11.1% vs 2.83%, P = 0.0185) in the complete-case analysis.\n\n No differences were seen in the intention to treat analysis, and no other group differences were observed.\n\n Both exercise conditions were associated with temporal improvements in % body fat, total cholesterol, medium VLDL,

particular interest in terms of obesity treatment.\n\n However, it is still unclear whether an intensive bout of exercise can affect the energy consumption of obese children and adolescents.\n\n\nObjective\nTo compare the impact of high vs.\n\n moderate intensity exercises on subsequent 24-h energy intake, macronutrient preferences, appetite sensations, energy expenditure and balance in obese adolescent.\n\n\nDesign\nThis randomized cross-over trial involves 15 obese adolescent boys who were asked to randomly complete three 24-h sessions in a metabolic chamber, each separated by at least 7 days: (1) sedentary (SED); (2) Low-Intensity Exercise (LIE) (40% maximal oxygen uptake, VO2max); (3) High-Intensity Exercise (HIE) (75%VO2max).\n\n\nResults\nDespite unchanged appetite sensations, 24-h total energy intake following HIE was 611% lower compared to LIE and SED (p&lt;0.05), whereas no differences appeared between SED and LIE.\n\n Energy intake at lunch was 9.4% and 8.4% lower after HIE compared to SED and LIE, respectively (p&lt;0.05).\n\n At dinner time, it was 20.5% and 19.7% lower after HIE compared to SED and LIE, respectively (p&lt;0.01).\n\n 24-h energy expenditure was not significantly altered.\n\n Thus, the 24-h energy balance was significantly reduced during HIE compared to SED and LIE (p&lt;0.01), whereas those of SED and LIE did not differ.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn obese adolescent boys, HIE has a beneficial impact on 24-h energy balance, mainly due to the spontaneous decrease in energy intake during lunch and dinner following the exercise bout.\n\n Prescribing high-intensity exercises to promote weight loss may therefore provide effective results without affecting appetite sensations and, as a result, food

This study investigated the ad libitum energy intake and appetite responses to a single session of HIIT versus moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and vigorous-intensity continuous training (VICT).\n Using a randomized crossover design, 11 middle-aged physically inactive men (45.7 ± 7.4 years, 23.5 ± 2.1 kg m?2) participated in three treadmill trials at 7-day intervals.\n HIIT comprised 10 1-min periods at 100% VO2max interspersed with 1-min periods of active recovery.\n MICT comprised a 40-min session at 65% VO2max, while VICT comprised a 20-min session at 80% VO2max.\n After each

Appetite-Related Hormones: The Modulating Effect of Adiposity, Sex, and Habitual Physical Activity","abstract":"Exercise facilitates weight control, partly through effects on appetite regulation.\n Single bouts of exercise induce a short-term energy deficit without stimulating compensatory effects on appetite, whilst limited evidence suggests that exercise training may modify subjective and homeostatic mediators of appetite in directions associated with enhanced meal-induced satiety.\n However, a large variability in responses exists between individuals.\n This article reviews the evidence relating to how adiposity, sex, and habitual physical activity modulate exercise-induced appetite, energy intake, and appetite-related hormone responses.\n The balance of evidence suggests that adiposity and sex do not modify appetite or energy intake responses to acute or chronic exercise interventions, but individuals with higher habitual physical activity levels may better adjust energy intake in response to energy balance perturbations.\n The effect of these individual characteristics and behaviours on appetite-related hormone responses to exercise remains equivocal.\n These findings support the continued promotion of exercise as a strategy for inducing short-term energy deficits irrespective of adiposity and sex, as well as the ability of exercise to positively influence energy balance over the longer term.\n Future well-controlled studies are required to further ascertain the potential mediators of appetite responses to exercise.\n","id":"PMC6164815","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"James","surname":"Dorling","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David

the risk of several chronic diseases and related health problems.\n In addition, stress may contribute to ill-health indirectly via its downstream effects on individuals health-related behaviour, such as promoting the intake of unhealthy palatable foods high in fat and sugar content.\n This paper reviews (a) the research literature on stress-models; (b) recent research investigating stress-induced eating and (c) the potential physiological and psychological pathways contributing to stress-induced eating.\n Particular attention is given to (d) the role of physical exercise in attenuating acute stress, with exploration of potential mechanisms through which exercise may reduce unhealthy food and drink consumption subsequent to stressor exposure.\n Finally, exercise motivation is discussed as an important psychological influence over the capacity for physical exercise to attenuate unhealthy food and drink consumption after exposure to stressors.\n This paper aims to provide a better understanding of how physical exercise might alleviate stress-induced unhealthy food

in Health and Disease","abstract":"The definition of what constitutes a healthy diet is continually shifting to reflect the evolving understanding of the roles that different foods, essential

patterns positively influences health and promotes the prevention of common non-communicable diseases (NCDs).\n Greater consumption of health-promoting foods and limited intake of unhealthier options are intrinsic to the eating habits of certain regional diets such as the Mediterranean diet or have been constructed as part of dietary patterns designed to reduce disease risk, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets.\n In comparison with a more traditional Western diet, these healthier alternatives are higher in plant-based foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds, and nuts and lower in animal-based foods, particularly fatty and processed meats.\n To better understand the current concept of a healthy diet, this review describes the features and supporting clinical and epidemiologic data for diets that have been shown to prevent disease and/or positively influence health.\n In total, evidence from epidemiological studies and clinical trials indicates that these types of dietary patterns reduce risks of NCDs including cardiovascular disease

12th 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) emerged in Wuhan, China, sparking a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans (COVID-19).\n\n On the 24th of April 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the world, according to the COVID-Case Tracker by Johns Hopkins University, was 195,313, and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases was 2,783,512. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive impact on human health, causing sudden lifestyle changes, through social distancing and isolation at home, with social and economic consequences.\n\n Optimizing public health during this pandemic requires not only knowledge from the medical and biological sciences, but also of all human sciences related to lifestyle, social and behavioural studies, including dietary habits and lifestyle.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits and lifestyle changes among the Italian population aged???12 years.\n\n The study comprised a structured questionnaire packet that inquired demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, current employment); anthropometric data (reported weight and height); dietary habits information (adherence to the Mediterranean diet, daily intake of certain foods, food frequency, and number of meals/day); lifestyle habits information (grocery shopping, habit of smoking, sleep quality and physical activity).\n\n The survey was conducted from the 5th to the 24th of April 2020.\nResults\nid='Par3'>A total of 3533 respondents have been included in the study, aged between 12 and 86 years (76.1% females).\n\n The perception of weight gain was observed in 48.6% of the population; 3.3% of smokers decided to quit smoking; a slight increased physical activity has been reported, especially for bodyweight training, in 38.3% of respondents; the population group aged 1830 years resulted in having a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet when compared to the younger and the elderly population (p?&lt;?0.001; p?&lt;?0.001, respectively); 15% of respondents turned to farmers or organic, purchasing fruits and vegetables, especially in the North and Center of Italy, where BMI values were lower.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>In this study, we have provided for the first time data on the Italian population lifestyle, eating habits and adherence to the Mediterranean Diet pattern during the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\n However, as the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, our data need to be confirmed and investigated in future more extensive population studies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7278251","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Di Renzo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paola","surname":"Gualtieri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francesca","surname":"Pivari","email":"francesca.pivari@unimi.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Soldati","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Soldati","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alda","surname":"Attinà","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giulia","surname":"Cinelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claudia","surname":"Leggeri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giovanna","surname":"Caparello","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luigi","surname":"Barrea","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Francesco","surname":"Scerbo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ernesto","surname":"Esposito","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antonino","surname":"De Lorenzo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern","abstract":"","id":"PMC7135038","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"cyh-birm@263.net","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter W","surname":"Horby","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick G","surname":"Hayden","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/tmi.13383","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The COVID?19 epidemic","abstract":"","id":"PMC7169770","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Thirumalaisamy P.","surname":"Velavan","email":"velavan@medizin.uni-tuebingen.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christian G.","surname":"Meyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"FAQ:Covid-19, domande e risposte. http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&amp;id=228#11.

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 2024 h per day at home (84.7%);

arthropathy, ovarian polycytosis, sleep apnea syndrome, and some neoplasms.\n Despite numerous informative campaigns, unfortunately, the fight against obesity does not seem to work: in the last years,

the main stimulus for the research of the mechanisms underlying this pathology and the related disorders.\n The aims of this review is to provide a revision of the literature in order to define obesity as diseases, secondly to highlight the limits and the inaccuracy of common tools used for the diagnosis of obesity, and as a third thing to strengthen the concept of the complexity of obesity as a disease among political health care providers.\n Obesity may be viewed as a multifactorial pathology and chronic low-grade inflammatory disease.\n In fact, people affected by obesity have greater risk of developing comorbility and morbility, respect to healthy.\n Hence, the absolute therapeutic benefit is directly proportional to the basic risk.\n So, internationally interest on early

that BMI alone cannot define obesity, which consists not so much in weight gain as in excess fat mass.\n The use of suitable tools for the assessment of fat mass percentage combined with clinical and

of COVID-19 Home Confinement on Eating Behaviour and Physical Activity: Results of the ECLB-COVID19 International Online Survey","abstract":"Background: Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home confinement.\n While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined.\n Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions.\n This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours.\n Methods: Following a structured review of the literature, the Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19) Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics.\n The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform.\n Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages.\n Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses before and during confinement conditions.\n Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis.\n The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall).\n Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day.\n Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly.\n Conclusion: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction.\n A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.\n","id":"PMC7352706","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Achraf","surname":"Ammar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Khaled","surname":"Trabelsi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamdi","surname":"Chtourou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Boukhris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liwa","surname":"Masmoudi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bassem","surname":"Bouaziz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ellen","surname":"Bentlage","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniella","surname":"How","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Notger","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Asma","surname":"Aloui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Hammouda","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laisa

associated with lower obesity risk.\n\n It is unclear whether a brief dietary assessment tool, instead of full-length comprehensive methods, can also capture this association.\n\n In addition to reduced costs, a brief tool has the interesting advantage of allowing immediate feedback to participants in interventional studies.\n\n Another relevant question is which individual items of such a brief tool are responsible for this association.\n\n We examined these associations using a 14-item tool of adherence to the Mediterranean diet as exposure and body mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) as outcomes.\n\n\nDesign\nCross-sectional assessment of all participants in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) trial.\n\n\nSubjects\n7,447 participants (5580 years, 57% women) free of cardiovascular disease, but with either type 2 diabetes or ?3 cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n Trained dietitians used both a validated 14-item questionnaire and a full-length validated 137-item food frequency questionnaire to assess dietary habits.\n\n Trained nurses measured weight, height and waist circumference.\n\n\nResults\nStrong inverse linear associations between the 14-item tool and all adiposity indexes were found.\n\n For a two-point increment in the 14-item score, the multivariable-adjusted differences in WHtR were ?0.0066 (95% confidence interval, 0.0088 to ?0.0049) for women and 0.0059 (0.0079 to 0.0038) for men.\n\n The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for a WHtR&gt;0.6 in participants scoring ?10 points versus ?7 points was 0.68 (0.57 to 0.80) for women and 0.66 (0.54 to 0.80) for men.\n\n High consumption of nuts and low consumption of sweetened/carbonated beverages presented the strongest inverse associations with abdominal obesity.\n\n\nConclusions\nA brief 14-item tool was able to capture a strong monotonic inverse association between adherence to a good quality dietary pattern (Mediterranean diet) and obesity indexes in a population of adults at high cardiovascular risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3419206","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

physical activity behavior.\n\n The purpose of this study was to investigate college students stages of motivational readiness to avoid sedentary behaviors and relevant psychological determinants using newly developed TTM questionnaires and to identify the association between current physical activity and sedentary behaviors based on TTM constructs.\n\n\nMethods\nData were obtained from 225 college students enrolled in health education and physical education courses.\n\n Participants completed a package of questionnaires including validated TTM, physical activity and sitting time questionnaires.\n\n Participants also wore an accelerometer for seven consecutive days.\n\n MANOVAs were conducted to determine mean differences in psychological constructs across the TTM stages, and

experienced substantial lifestyle changes alongside the stresses of potentially catching the virus or experiencing bereavement.\n Stressful situations and poorer health behaviors (e.\ng.\n, higher alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, poorer sleep quality, physical inactivity) are frequently linked to poor mental health.\n Our objective was to examine changes in health behaviors and their relationship with negative mood during COVID-19 lockdown.\n We also considered associations between health behaviors and socio-demographic differences and COVID-19-induced changes.\n 399 participants completed a questionnaire asking about their personal situation and health behaviors during lockdown as well as a negative mood scale.\n The significance threshold for all analyses was ? = 0.05. Poorer diet was linked to more-negative mood, and to changes to working status.\n Poorer sleep quality was linked with more-negative mood, and with shielding from the virus.\n Being less physically active was related to more-negative mood and student status, whereas being more physically active was linked to having or suspecting COVID-19 infection within the household.\n Increased alcohol consumption was linked to living with children, but not to negative mood.\n Changes to diet, sleep quality, and physical activity related to differences in negative mood during COVID-19 lockdown.\n This study adds to reports on poor mental health during lockdown and identifies lifestyle restrictions and changes to health behaviors which may, to some extent, be responsible for higher negative

Specific Aerobic Training in Adolescent Taekwondo Athletes","abstract":"The efficacy of replacing generic running with Taekwondo (TKD) specific technical skills during interval training at an intensity corresponding to 9095% of maximum heart rate (HRmax) has not yet been demonstrated.\n Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the HR responses and perceived exertion between controlled running and high-intensity TKD technical interval training in adolescent TKD athletes.\n Eighteen adolescent, male TKD athletes performed short-duration interval running and TKD specific technical skills (i.\ne.\n 1020 [10-s of exercise interspersed with 20 s of passive recovery]) in a counterbalanced design.\n In both training methods, HR was measured and expressed as the percentage of HR reserve (%HRres).\n Rating of perceived exertion (RPE, Borgs category rating-10 scale), Banisters training impulse (TRIMP) and Edwards training load (TL) were used to quantify the internal training load.\n Recorded cardiovascular responses expressed in %HRres in the two training methods were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05).\n Furthermore, the two training methods induced similar training loads as calculated by Banister and Edwards methods.\n Perceived exertion ranged between hard and very hard during all interval training sessions.\n These findings showed that performing repeated TKD specific skills increased HR to the same level, and were perceived as producing the same training intensity as did short-duration interval running in adolescent TKD athletes.\n Therefore, using specific TKD kicking exercises in high-intensity interval training can be applied to bring more variety during training, mixing physical and technical aspects of the sport, while reaching the same intensity as interval running.\n","id":"PMC3588613","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Versita,

method (Session-RPE) and two objective heart-rate (HR)-based methods to quantify training-load (TL) during international karate competition.\n\n\nMethods\nEleven karatekas took part in this study, but only data from seven athletes who completed three matches in an international tournament were used (four men and three women).\n\n The duration of combat was 3 min for men and 2 min for women, with 33.6±7.6 min for the first interval period (match 12) and 14.5±3.1 min for the second interval period (match 23).\n\n HR was continuously recorded during each combat.\n\n Blood lactate [La-] and (RPE) were measured just before the first match and immediately after each match.\n\n\nResults\nMeans total fights time, HR, %HRmax, [La-], and session-RPE were 4.7±1.6 min, 182±9 bpm, 91±3%, 9.02±2.12 mmol.\n\nL-1 and 4.2±1.2, respectively.\n\n No significant differences in %HRmax, [La-], and RPE were noticed across combats.\n\n Significant correlations were observed between RPE and both resting HR (r=0.60; P=0.004) and mean HR (r=0.64; P=0.02), session-RPE and Banister training-impulse (TRIMP) (r=0.84; P&lt;0.001) and Edwards TL (r=0.77; P&lt;0.01).\n\n\nConclusion\nInternational karate competition elicited near-maximal cardiovascular responses and high [La-].\n\n Training should therefore include exercise bouts that sufficiently stimulate the zone between 90 and 100% HRmax.\n\n Karate coaches could use the RPE-method to follow competitor's competition loads and consider it in their technical and tactical

Internal Training Loads of Functional Fitness Training Sessions Performed at Different Intensities When Compared to Training Impulse","abstract":"Despite its increase in popularity, little is known about how to best quantify internal training loads from functional fitness training (FFT) sessions.\n The purpose of this study was to assess which method [training impulse (TRIMP) or session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE)] is more accurate to monitor training loads in FFT.\n Eight trained males (age 28.1 ± 6.0 years) performed an ALL-OUT FFT session and an intensity-controlled session (RPE of six out of 10).\n Internal load was determined via Edwards TRIMP (eTRIMP), Bannisters TRIMP (bTRIMP), and sRPE.\n Heart rate was measured continuously during the session, while blood lactate and rate of perceived exertion were measured at baseline, and immediately and 30 min after the sessions.\n ALL-OUT blood lactate and RPE were significantly higher immediately and 30 min after the session compared to the RPE6 condition.\n ALL-OUT training load was significantly different between conditions using bTRIMP (61.1 ± 10.6 vs.\n 55.7 ± 12.4 AU) and sRPE (91.7 ± 30.4 vs.\n 42.6 ± 14.9 AU), with sRPE being more sensitive to such differences [p = 0.045, effect size (ES) = 0.76 and p = 0.002, ES = 1.82, respectively].\n No differences in the training loads of the different sessions were found using eTRIMP (93.1 ± 9.5 vs.\n 84.9 ± 13.7 AU, p = 0.085).\n Only sRPE showed a significant correlation with lactate 30 min post session (p = 0.015; p = 0.596, large).\n sRPE was more accurate than both TRIMP methods to represent the overall training load of the FFT sessions.\n While the use of sRPE is advised, further research is necessary to establish its ability to reflect changes in fitness, fatigue, and performance during a period of training.\n","id":"PMC7435063","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Joao Henrique","surname":"Falk

to (PRE), immediately post (IP), 30-min post- (30P) and 60-min post-workout (60P) each week.\n Tension, depression, anger, confusion, fatigue and vigor were derived from the POMS, as was Total Mood

Training: Potential Applications to Improve Sport Performance","abstract":"Training for sports performance requires the development of multiple fitness components within the same program.\n In this context, training strategies that have the potential to concomitantly enhance metabolic and musculoskeletal fitness are of great value for athletes and coaches.\n The purpose of this manuscript is to review the current studies on high-intensity functional training (HIFT) and to assess how HIFT could be utilized in order to improve sport-specific performance.\n Studies on untrained and recreationally-active participants have led to positive results on aerobic power and anaerobic capacity, and muscular endurance, while results on muscular strength and power are less clear.\n Still, HIFT sessions can elicit high levels of metabolic stress and resistance training exercises are prescribed with parameters that can lead to improvements in muscular endurance, hypertrophy, strength,

Functional Training (HIFT): Definition and Research Implications for Improved Fitness","abstract":"High-intensity functional training (HIFT) is an exercise modality that emphasizes functional, multi-joint movements that can be modified to any fitness level and elicit greater muscle recruitment than more traditional exercise.\n As a relatively new training modality, HIFT is often compared to high-intensity interval training (HIIT), yet the two are distinct.\n HIIT exercise is characterized by relatively short bursts of repeated vigorous activity, interspersed by periods of rest or low-intensity exercise for recovery, while HIFT utilizes constantly varied functional exercises and various activity durations that may or may not incorporate rest.\n Over the last decade, studies evaluating the effectiveness of HIIT programs have documented improvements in metabolic and cardiorespiratory adaptations; however, less is known about the effects of HIFT.\n The purpose of this manuscript is to provide a working definition of HIFT and review the available literature regarding its use to improve metabolic and cardiorespiratory adaptations in strength and conditioning programs among various populations.\n Additionally, we aim to create a definition that is used in future publications to evaluate more effectively the future impact of this type of training on health and fitness outcomes.\n","id":"PMC6162410","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Yuri","surname":"Feito","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Katie

Mediators","abstract":"In diverse fields of empirical researchincluding many in the biological sciencesattempts are made to decompose the effect of an exposure on an outcome into its effects via a number of different pathways.\n For example, we may wish to separate the effect of heavy alcohol consumption on systolic blood pressure (SBP) into effects via body mass index (BMI), via gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and via other pathways.\n Much progress has been made, mainly due to contributions from the field of causal inference, in understanding the precise nature of statistical estimands that capture such intuitive effects, the assumptions under which they can be identified, and statistical methods for doing so.\n These contributions have focused almost entirely on settings with a single mediator, or a set of mediators considered en bloc; in many applications, however, researchers attempt a much more ambitious decomposition into numerous path-specific effects through many mediators.\n In this article, we give counterfactual definitions of such path-specific estimands in settings with multiple mediators, when earlier mediators may affect later ones, showing that there are many ways in which decomposition can be done.\n We discuss the strong assumptions under which the effects are identified, suggesting a sensitivity analysis approach when a particular subset of the assumptions cannot be justified.\n These ideas are illustrated using data on alcohol consumption, SBP, BMI, and GGT from the Izhevsk Family Study.\n We aim to bridge the gap from single mediator theory to multiple mediator practice, highlighting the ambitious nature of this endeavor and giving practical suggestions on how to proceed.\n","id":"PMC4402024","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","authors":[{"firstname":"R

In high-income countries, younger age was associated with higher 12-month prevalence; by contrast, in several low- to middle-income countries, older age was associated with greater likelihood of MDE.\n\n The strongest demographic correlate in high-income countries was being separated from a partner, and in low- to middle-income countries, was being divorced or widowed.\n\n\nConclusions\nMDE is a significant public-health concern across all regions of the world and is strongly linked to social conditions.\n\n Future research is needed to investigate the combination of demographic risk factors that are most strongly associated with MDE in the specific countries included in the WMH.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3163615","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Evelyn","surname":"Bromet","email":"ebromet@notes.cc.sunysb.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laura Helena","surname":"Andrade","email":"lhsgandr@usp.br","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Irving","surname":"Hwang","email":"hwang@hcp.med.harvard.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nancy A","surname":"Sampson","email":"sampson@hcp.med.harvard.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jordi","surname":"Alonso","email":"jalonso@imim.es","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giovanni","surname":"de Girolamo","email":"gdegirolamo@fatebenefratelli.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ron","surname":"de Graaf","email":"rgraaf@trimbos.nl","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Koen","surname":"Demyttenaere","email":"koen.demyttenaere@uz.kuleuven.ac.be","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chiyi","surname":"Hu","email":"chiyihu@yahoo.com.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Noboru","surname":"Iwata","email":"iwatan@he.hirokoku-u.ac.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aimee N","surname":"Karam","email":"aimeekaram@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jagdish","surname":"Kaur","email":"jagdish.kaur@nic.in","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stanislav","surname":"Kostyuchenko","email":"staskiev@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Pierre","surname":"Lépine","email":"jean-pierre.lepine@lrb.aphp.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daphna","surname":"Levinson","email":"daphna.levinson@moh.health.gov.il","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Herbert","surname":"Matschinger","email":"Herbert.Matschinger@medizin.uni-leipzig.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria Elena Medina","surname":"Mora","email":"medinam@imp.edu.mx","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark Oakley","surname":"Browne","email":"mark.oakley-browne@dhhs.tas.gov.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jose","surname":"Posada-Villa","email":"latos98@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria Carmen","surname":"Viana","email":"mcviana@uol.com.br","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David R","surname":"Williams","email":"dwilliam@hsph.harvard.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ronald C","surname":"Kessler","email":"kessler@hcp.med.harvard.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00127-005-0927-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiology of psychiatric and alcohol disorders in Ukraine: Findings from the Ukraine World Mental Health Survey","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"De-standardization of the life course: What it might mean?

established links with bipolar disorder, as well as some links with depression and anxiety.\n\n The aim of the present study is to examine social rhythm and its relationship to various aspects of health, including physical health, negative mental health, and positive mental health.\n\n\nMethod\nQuestionnaire data were obtained from a large-scale multi-national sample of 8095 representative participants from the U.\n\nS.\n\n, Russia, and Germany.\n\n\nResults\nResults indicated that social rhythm irregularity is related to increased reporting of health problems, depression, anxiety, and stress.\n\n In contrast, greater regularity is related to better overall health state, life satisfaction, and positive mental health.\n\n The effects are generally small in size, but hold even when controlling for gender, marital status, education, income, country, and social support.\n\n Further, social rhythm means differ across Russia, the U.\n\nS.\n\n, and Germany.\n\n Relationships with

Iran","abstract":"Background\nThe nation-wide epidemiological survey of psychiatric disorders in term of lifetime prevalence is not adequately known in Iran.\n\n The prevalence of lifetime psychiatric disorders was estimated among the population of aged 18 and over on gender, age group, educational level, occupational status, marital status, and residential area.\n\n\nMethods\nThe subjects were 25,180 individuals selected through a clustered random sampling method.\n\n The psychiatric disorders were diagnosed on the bases of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria.\n\n It is the first study in which the structured psychiatric interview administered to a representative sample of the Iranian population age 18 and over by the 250 trained clinical psychologist interviewers.\n\n The data was entered through EPI-Info software twice in an attempt to prevent any errors and SPSS-11 statistical software was also used for analyses.\n\n The odds ratios and their confidence intervals estimated by using logistic regression.\n\n\nResults and Discussion\nThe prevalence of psychiatric disorders was 10.81%.\n\n It was more common among females than males (14.34% vs.\n\n 7.34%, P &lt; 0.001).\n\n The prevalence of anxiety and mood disorders were 8.35% and 4.29% respectively.\n\n The prevalence of psychotic disorders was 0.89%; neuro-cognitive disorders, 2.78% and dissociative disorders, 0.77%.\n\n Among mood disorders, major depressive disorder (2.98%) and among anxiety disorders, phobic disorder (2.05%) had the higher prevalence.\n\n The prevalence of psychiatric disorders among divorced and separated 22.31%; residents of urban areas 11.77%; illiterates 13.80%; householders 15.48%; unemployed 12.33% that were more than other groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe mental health pattern in Iran is similar to the western countries, but it seems that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in Iran may be lower than these countries.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1253522","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

models of major depression for linking psychiatric epidemiology to clinical practice","abstract":"Background\nMost epidemiological studies of major depression report estimates of period prevalence.\n\n Such estimates are useful for public health applications, but are not very helpful for informing clinical practice.\n\n Period prevalence is determined predominantly by incidence and episode duration, but it is difficult to connect these epidemiological concepts to clinical issues such as risk and prognosis.\n\n Incidence is important for primary and secondary prevention, and prognostic information is useful for clinical decision-making.\n\n The objective of this study was to decompose period prevalence data for major depression into its constituent elements, thereby enhancing the value of these estimates for clinical practice.\n\n Data from a series of population-based Canadian studies were used in the analysis.\n\n Markov models depicting incidence, prevalence and recovery from major depressive episodes were developed.\n\n Monte Carlo simulation was used to constrain model parameters to the epidemiological data.\n\n\nResults\nThe association of sex with major depression was found to be due to a higher incidence in women.\n\n In distinction, the higher prevalence in unmarried subjects was mostly due to a different prognosis.\n\n Age-related changes in prevalence were influenced by both factors.\n\n Education, which was not found to be associated with major depression in the survey data, had no impact either on risk or prognosis.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe period prevalence of major depression is influenced both by incidence (risk) and episode duration (prognosis).\n\n Mathematical modeling of the underlying epidemiological relationships can make such data more readily interpretable in relation to clinical practice.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1151594","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

disorders in a nationally representative sample of the general population of Greece","abstract":"Background\nNo study in Greece has assessed so far the full range of common mental disorders using a representative sample of the population from both mainland and insular regions of the country.\n\n The aim of the present paper was to present the results of the first such study.\n\n\nMethods\nThe study was carried out between 20092010 in a nationally representative sample of 4894 individuals living in private households in Greece.\n\n Common mental disorders in the past week were assessed with the revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R).\n\n We also assessed alcohol use disorders (using AUDIT), smoking and cannabis use.\n\n\nResults\n14% of the population (Male: 11%, Female: 17%) was found to have clinically significant psychiatric morbidity according to the scores on the CIS-R.\n\n The prevalence (past seven days) of specific common mental disorders was as follows: Generalized Anxiety Disorder: 4.10% (95% CI: 3.54, 4.65); Depression: 2.90% (2.43, 3.37); Panic Disorder: 1.88% (1.50, 2.26); Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: 1.69% (1.33, 2.05); All Phobias: 2.79% (2.33, 3.26); Mixed anxiety-depression: 2.67% (2.22, 3.12).\n\n Harmful alcohol use was reported by 12.69% of the population (11.75, 13.62).\n\n Regular smoking was reported by 39.60% of the population (38.22, 40.97) while cannabis use (at least once during the past month) by 2.06% (1.66, 2.46).\n\n Clinically significant psychiatric morbidity was positively associated with the following variables: female gender, divorced or widowed family status, low educational status and unemployment.\n\n Use of all substances was more common in men compared to women.\n\n Common mental disorders were often comorbid, undertreated, and associated with a lower quality of life.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe findings of the present study can help in the better planning and development of mental health services in Greece, especially in a time of mental health budget restrictions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3686601","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

this pattern has changed over time, is not known.\n\n\nMethods\nData were based on classroom surveys every second year from 20002001 to 20102011 using nationwide samples of 1416-year old Finns (n?=?618,084).\n\n Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires including questions on health, health behaviours, and school experiences.\n\n Depression was measured with a Finnish modification of the 13-item Beck Depression Inventory, and divided into no, mild, moderate and severe depression.\n\n The association between depression and the social background (parents education

non-response in the Swiss health survey: determinants and bias in outcomes","abstract":"Background\nUnit non-response occurs in sample surveys when a target subject does not respond to a survey.\n\n Potential implications are decreased power, increased standard error, and non-response bias.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the factors associated with participation in a written survey (MSHS) of subjects who had previously participated in the Swiss Health Survey (SHS) and to evaluate to what extent non-participation could impact the estimation of various MSHS health outcomes.\n\n\nMethods\nMultivariate logistic regression was used to assess the factors associated with MSHS participation (n=14,393) by eligible SHS participants (n=17,931).\n\n Crude participation rates and the adjusted odds ratios of participation (OR) were reported.\n\n In order to report potential bias in MSHS outcomes, the average age-standardized and sex-specific outcome values in non-participants were predicted based on several different linear regression models which had been previously fitted on MSHS participants.\n\n\nResults\nAdjusting for all other variables, women (OR=1.63) as compared with men, subjects with a secondary (OR=1.48) or tertiary education (OR=1.76) as compared with those with primary education, white-collar workers (high level non-manual workers OR=1.29, medium and low level non-manual workers OR=1.26 and OR=1.25 respectively) as compared with unskilled manual workers, Swiss nationals (OR=1.60) as compared to non-Swiss, and subjects with very good or good self-rated health (OR=1.35) were more likely to participate in the MSHS.\n\n People who work full-time were less likely to participate than those without paid work (OR=0.76).\n\n There were no statistically significant differences in the likelihood of participation between rural and urban areas, different geographic regions of Switzerland and household income quartiles.\n\n\nConclusions\nSubjects who participated in the MSHS had a higher socio-economic status, reported a better subjective health, and were more likely to be Swiss nationals.\n\n Small to moderate bias was found for most age-adjusted and sex-specific average outcomes.\n\n Consequently, these MSHS outcomes should be used and interpreted with care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3599843","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

prevented by quarantine and isolation of the populations at risk.\n\n These approaches restrict the mobility, social interactions, and daily activities of the affected individuals.\n\n In recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, quarantine and isolation are being adopted in many contexts, which necessitates an evaluation of global evidence on how such measures impact the mental health outcomes among populations.\n\n This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the available evidence on mental health outcomes of quarantine and isolation for preventing infectious diseases.\n\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched nine major databases and additional sources and included articles if they were systematically conducted reviews, published as peer-reviewed journal articles, and reported mental health outcomes of quarantine or isolation in any population.\n\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 1,364 citations, only eight reviews met our criteria.\n\n Most of the primary studies in those reviews were conducted in high-income nations and in hospital settings.\n\n These articles reported a high burden of mental health problems among patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare providers who experienced quarantine or isolation.\n\n Prevalent mental health problems among the affected individuals include depression, anxiety, mood disorders, psychological distress, posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia, fear, stigmatization, low self-esteem, lack of self-control, and other adverse mental health outcomes.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis umbrella review found severe

potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility.\n Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence.\n We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases.\n Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review.\n Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger.\n Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma.\n Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects.\n In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided.\n Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.\n","id":"PMC7158942","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Samantha

Syndrome","abstract":"OBJECTIVES\nIsolation due to the management of infectious diseases is thought to affect mental health, but the effects are still unknown.\n\n We examined the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and anger in persons isolated during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic both at isolation period and at four to six months after release from isolation.\n\n We also determined risk factors associated with these symptoms at four to six months.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOf 14,992 individuals isolated for 2-week due to having contact with MERS patients in 2015, when MERS was introduced to Korea, 1,692 individuals were included in this study.\n\n Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and anger was assessed with the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory at four to six months after release from isolation for MERS.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 1,692 who came in contact with MERS patients, 1,656 were not diagnosed with MERS.\n\n Among 1,656, anxiety symptoms showed 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3 to 8.9%) and feelings of anger were present in 16.6% (95% CI, 14.8 to 18.4%) during the isolation period.\n\n At four to six months after release from isolation, anxiety symptoms were observed in 3.0% (95%CI, 2.2 to 3.9%).\n\n Feelings of anger were present in 6.4% (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.6%).\n\n Risk factors for experiencing anxiety symptoms and anger at four to six months after release included symptoms related to MERS during isolation, inadequate supplies (food, clothes, accommodation), social networking activities (email, text, Internet), history of psychiatric illnesses, and financial loss.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMental health problems at four to six month after release from isolation might be prevented by providing mental health support to individuals with vulnerable mental health, and providing accurate information as well as appropriate supplies, including food, clothes, and accommodation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5177805","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Korean Society of

Data from Australia's first outbreak of equine influenza","abstract":"Background\nIn 2007 Australia experienced its first outbreak of highly infectious equine influenza.\n\n Government disease control measures were put in place to control, contain, and eradicate the disease; these measures included movement restrictions and quarantining of properties.\n\n This study was conducted to assess the psycho-social impacts of this disease, and this paper reports the prevalence of, and factors influencing, psychological distress during this outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nData were collected using an online survey, with a link directed to the affected population via a number of industry groups.\n\n Psychological distress, as determined by the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale, was the main outcome measure.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 2760 people participated in this study.\n\n Extremely high levels of non-specific psychological distress were reported by respondents in this study, with 34% reporting high psychological distress (K10 &gt; 22), compared to levels of around 12% in the Australian general population.\n\n Analysis, using backward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis, revealed that those living in high risk infection (red) zones (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.572.55; p &lt; 0.001) and disease buffer (amber) zones (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.362.46; p &lt; 0.001) were at much greater risk of high psychological distress than those living in uninfected (white zones).\n\n Although prevalence of high psychological distress was greater in infected EI zones and States, elevated levels of psychological distress were experienced in horse-owners nationally.\n\n Statistical analysis indicated that certain groups were more vulnerable to high psychological distress; specifically younger people, and those with lower levels of formal educational qualifications.\n\n Respondents whose principal source of income was from horse-related industry were more than twice as likely to have high psychological distress than those whose primary source of income was not linked to horse-related industry (OR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.822.73; p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nAlthough, methodologically, this study had good internal validity, it has limited generalisability because it was not possible to identify, bound, or sample the target population accurately.\n\n However, this study is the first to collect psychological distress data from an affected population during such a disease outbreak and has potential to inform those involved in assessing the potential psychological impacts of human infectious diseases, such as pandemic influenza.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2571100","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Melanie

December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began to spread in central China.\n\n Social capital is a measure of social trust, belonging, and participation.\n\n This study aimed to investigate the effects of social capital on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved in people who self-isolated at home for 14 days in January 2020 during the COVID-19 epidemic in central China.\n\n\nMethods\nIndividuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third day of isolation.\n\n Individual social capital was assessed using the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire.\n\n Anxiety was assessed using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire.\n\n Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearsons correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM).\n\n\nResults\nLow levels of social capital were associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress, but increased levels of social capital were positively associated with increased quality of sleep.\n\n Anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality, and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social capital on sleep quality.\n\n\nConclusion\nDuring a period of individual self-isolation

prevention: a systematic umbrella review of the global evidence","abstract":"OBJECTIVES\nTransmission of infectious diseases is often prevented by quarantine and isolation of the populations at risk.\n\n These approaches restrict the mobility, social interactions, and daily activities of the affected individuals.\n\n In recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, quarantine and isolation are being adopted in many contexts, which necessitates an evaluation of global evidence on how such measures impact the mental health outcomes among populations.\n\n This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the available evidence on mental health outcomes of quarantine and isolation for preventing infectious diseases.\n\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched nine major databases and additional sources and included articles if they were systematically conducted reviews, published as peer-reviewed journal articles, and reported mental health outcomes of quarantine or isolation in any population.\n\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 1,364 citations, only eight reviews met our criteria.\n\n Most of the primary studies in those reviews were conducted in high-income nations and in hospital settings.\n\n These articles reported a high burden of mental health problems among patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare providers who experienced quarantine or isolation.\n\n Prevalent mental health problems among the affected individuals include depression, anxiety, mood disorders, psychological distress, posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia, fear, stigmatization, low self-esteem, lack of self-control, and other adverse mental health outcomes.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis umbrella review found severe mental health problems among individuals and populations who have undergone quarantine and isolation in different contexts.\n\n This evidence necessitates multipronged interventions including policy measures for strengthening mental health services globally and promoting psychosocial wellbeing among high-risk populations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7644933","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Korean Society of Epidemiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Md

the relationship between strict adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) and emotional well-being through a descriptive, exploratory, transversal, and correlational study of students from the Campus

well-being (both positive and negative affection) with the Spanish version of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the state of perceived health with the Short Form-36 (SF36), and the degree of physical activity using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF).\n A strict adherence to the MD was found to be significantly related to positive emotional state (? = 0.018, p = 0.009).\n The perceived state of health (? = 0.192, p &lt; 0.001), mental role (? = 0.346, p &lt; 0.001), and physical activity (? = 0.155, p = 0.007) were found to be predictive factors of a positive emotional state.\n Conversely, the relationship between the adherence to the MD and a negative emotional state was not significant.\n Various components of the MD were found to be independently connected to well-being.\n The results suggest that adopting a nutritional pattern such as the MD is linked to an improvement in emotional well-being.\n","id":"PMC7353387","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"María","surname":"López-Olivares","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Miriam","surname":"Mohatar-Barba","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elisabet","surname":"Fernández-Gómez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carmen","surname":"Enrique-Mirón","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Carmen","surname":"Enrique-Mirón","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References

this study was to evaluate the health and lifestyle of undergraduates and assess risk factors associated with psychiatric symptoms.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nBetween September 2012 and June 2013, we included all undergraduate students who underwent compulsory a medical visit at the university medical service in Nice (France) during which they were screened for potential diseases during a diagnostic interview.\n\n Data were collected prospectively in the CALCIUM database (Consultations Assistés par Logiciel pour les Centres Inter-Universitaire de Médecine) and included information about the students lifestyle (living conditions, dietary behavior, physical activity, use of recreational drugs).\n\n The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms related to depression, anxiety and panic attacks was assessed and risk factors for these symptoms were analyzed using logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 4,184 undergraduates were included.\n\n Prevalence for depression, anxiety and panic attacks were 12.6%, 7.6% and 1.0%, respectively.\n\n During the 30 days preceding the evaluation, 0.6% of the students regularly drank alcohol, 6.3% were frequent-to-heavy tobacco smokers,

students at risk of developing chronic disease is far from being negligible.\n\n Understanding predictors for these symptoms may improve students health by implementing targeted prevention campaigns.\n\n Further research in other French universities is necessary to confirm our results.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5703533","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

of Vigorous-Intensity Physical Activity on Body Composition Parameters, Lipid Profile Markers, and Irisin Levels in Adolescents: A Cross-Sectional Study","abstract":"In adolescence, health status is influenced by several factors, including dietary pattern and physical activity (PA) which are crucial elements of lifestyle in terms of prevention and treatment of metabolic and chronic diseases.\n The current study aimed to explore the impact of the different intensity levels of PA along with the adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MD), on body composition indices and metabolic parameters in a cohort of adolescents, thereby investigating potential predictors of health behavior in youth.\n This cross-sectional study was carried out among 92 participants (44 girls and 48 boys, aged 14 to 17 years), which were divided into the following three groups according to intensity levels of PA: Group A (physical inactivity), Group B (moderate PA), and Group C (vigorous-intensity PA).\n The Questionnaire of Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (KIDMED test) was used to assess both diet composition and adherence to a MD.\n All subjects underwent anthropometric measurements, bio-impedentiometric analysis for body composition parameters, and biochemical and hormonal measurements.\n The majority of adolescents (60.87%) had a medium adherence to the MD, and even a better distribution of food rates was found in adolescents performing vigorous-intensity PA.\n A comparison of anthropometric measurements and body composition parameters among groups showed that body mass index and fat mass (FM) were significantly lower while body cell mass (BCM), free fat mass (FFM), phase angle (PhA), and total body water (TBW) were higher in Group C adolescents as compared with those of Group A.\n In Group C, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was reduced and insulin levels were inversely associated with FFM (r = ?0.454 and p = 0.004) and directly correlated with FM (r = 0.331 and p = 0.003).\n In the same Group C, we observed elevated serum irisin levels and lower lipid profile markers as compared with Group A.\n Interestingly, irisin negatively correlated with both total cholesterol (r = ?0.428 and p = 0.04) and LDL (r = ?0.468 and p = 0.02) in Group C.\n Finally, a receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis revealed irisin, LDL, HDL, and body composition variables (FFM, BMC, PhA, and TBW) as the most predictive measures for vigorous-intensity PA.\n Our results highlight the importance of developing healthy lifestyle programs that include improving the intensity of PA among a young population as a superior strategy for ensuring a better quality of life.\n","id":"PMC7146488","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Catia","surname":"Morelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ennio","surname":"Avolio","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ennio","surname":"Avolio","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Angelo","surname":"Galluccio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giovanna","surname":"Caparello","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emanuele","surname":"Manes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simona","surname":"Ferraro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniela","surname":"De

unanswered question.\n Our objective was to examine this relationship.\n The participants were ninth-grade secondary school students.\n Data were collected using anonymous, self-administered questionnaires.\n The knowledge-related questions were compiled by the authors, while the questions concerning eating habits, physical activity, demographic and socioeconomic data were taken from the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children survey.\n The relationship between knowledge and behavior was investigated with structural equation modeling adjusted for gender, age, and socioeconomic status.\n The results demonstrated a good fit to the data, but better knowledge was not related to behavior in our sample.\n This finding suggests that adolescents health behavior is highly influenced by the living context; therefore, appropriate knowledge is necessary but not sufficient to improve adolescents behavior.\n Hence, comprehensive health promotion programs could provide

Organization (WHO)).\n\n Nineteen countries and the European Union adopted the WHO guidelines.\n\n Guidelines varied in relation to date of release (2008 to 2019), targeted age group, and guideline wording regarding: type, amount, duration, intensity, frequency and total amount of physical activity.\n\n Twenty-two countries included sedentary behaviour within the guidelines and three included sleep.\n\n Total scores for all domains of the AGREE II assessment for each guideline indicated considerable variability in guideline quality ranging from 25.8 to 95.3%, with similar variability in the six individual domains.\n\n Rigorous guideline development is essential to ensure appropriate guidance for population level initiatives.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>This review revealed considerable variability between national/international physical activity guideline quality, development and recommendations, highlighting the need for rigorous and transparent guideline development methodologies to ensure appropriate guidance for population-based approaches.\n\n Where countries do not have the resources to ensure this level of quality, the adoption or adolopment (framework to review and update guidelines) of the WHO guidelines or guidelines of similar quality is recommended.\n\n\nTrial registration\nid='Par5'>Review registration: PROSPERO 2017

explain this increased phenomenon.\n As described in previous research, this fact has been associated with the development of high stress levels and dysfunctional lifestyles, in which eating habits play a main role.\n In this regard, loneliness has been classically associated with poor eating habits, fundamentally the consumption of processed food with little nutritional value.\n However, the relationship between loneliness and healthy eating patterns, such as the Mediterranean Diet (MD), has not been previously analyzed.\n The main aim of the present study was to identify the relationship between perceived loneliness, stress, dietary habits, and adherence to the MD in a sample of 527 Spanish adolescents.\n The obtained results show a significant association between high perceived loneliness and high stress levels with lower MD adherence.\n Hence, adolescents with high perceived loneliness exhibit poor dietary habits in comparison to those counterparts with low perceived loneliness.\n Mediation analyses demonstrated an indirect effect of the loneliness on adherence to the MD through the mediation effect of stress.\n These findings point out a possible mechanism that underlies the classic association between loneliness and health deterioration, based on a poor adherence to a healthy dietary pattern, such as the MD.\n","id":"PMC6315583","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Rosario","surname":"Ferrer-Cascales","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Natalia","surname":"Albaladejo-Blázquez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicolás","surname":"Ruiz-Robledillo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicolás","surname":"Ruiz-Robledillo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"María","surname":"Rubio-Aparicio","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"María","surname":"Rubio-Aparicio","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ana","surname":"Laguna-Pérez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ana","surname":"Zaragoza-Martí","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/hpm.2881","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evaluating

impaired cognition and academic performance.\n The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the associations between health behaviors and cognition and academic achievement in children and adolescents under 18 years of age with a special reference to diet quality.\n Dietary patterns with a low consumption of fish, fruits, and vegetables, and high in fast food, sausages, and soft drinks have been linked to poor cognition and academic achievement.\n The studies on the associations between the high intake of saturated fat and red meat and low intake of fiber and high-fiber grain products with cognition are limited.\n The available evidence and physiological mechanisms suggest that diet may have direct, indirect, and synergistic effects on brain and cognition with physical activity, sedentary behaviors, cardiometabolic health, and sleep, but the associations have been modest.\n Therefore, integrating a healthy diet, physically active lifestyle, and adequate sleep may provide optimal circumstances for brain development and learning.\n We conclude that most of the existing literature is contained in cross-sectional studies, which therefore highlights the need for longitudinal and intervention studies on the effects of diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep on cognition and academic

Experiment 1 examined emotion-specific patterns in the effectiveness of reappraisal and distraction strategies in 14-year-old adolescents (N = 50).\n Adolescents were instructed to answer spontaneously or to downregulate their responses by using either distraction or cognitive reappraisal strategies before viewing negative pictures and were asked to rate their emotional state after picture presentation.\n Results showed that reappraisal effectiveness was modulated by emotional content but distraction was not.\n Reappraisal was more effective than distraction at regulating fear or anxiety (threat-related pictures) but was similar to distraction regarding other emotions.\n Using the same paradigm, Experiment 2 examined in 12-year-old (N = 56), 13-year-old (N = 49) and 15-year-old adolescents (N = 54) the age-related differences a) in the effectiveness of reappraisal and distraction when implemented and b) in the everyday use of regulation strategies using the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire.\n Results revealed that regulation effectiveness was equivalent for both strategies in 12-year-olds, whereas a large improvement in reappraisal effectiveness was observed in 13- and 15-year-olds.\n No age differences were observed in the reported use of reappraisal, but older adolescents less frequently reported using distraction and more

these classes, yet they ignore the role that emotions can play in the adoption of future habits.\n Objectives: To analyze how emotions (emotional intelligence and emotional state) can influence the resilience and motivation of adolescents, as well as academic performance and adoption of healthy lifestyle habits.\n Methodology: 615 secondary school students between the ages of 14 and 19 participated (M = 16.02; SD = 1.57) in the study.\n A structural equations model was developed using the main variables and by applying some of the principles of Self-Determination Theory.\n The results show that emotional intelligence is positively related to positive emotions and negatively related to negative emotions.\n Positive emotions positively predict both self-motivation towards physical education classes and resilience.\n Resilience positively predicts self-motivation.\n Finally, self-motivation acts as a predictor of both academic performance and regular participation in physical activity.\n Conclusions: This study successfully shows the importance of focusing on emotions in PE classes inasmuch as emotion increases the tendency to get good grades and maintain active

metabolism, maintenance of structural integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, immunomodulation, and protection against pathogens.\n Gut microbiota are composed of different bacteria species taxonomically classified by genus, family, order, and phyla.\n Each humans gut microbiota are shaped in early life as their composition depends on infant transitions (birth gestational date, type of delivery, methods of milk feeding, weaning period) and external factors such as antibiotic use.\n These personal and healthy core native microbiota remain relatively stable in adulthood but differ between individuals due to enterotypes, body mass index (BMI) level, exercise frequency, lifestyle, and cultural and dietary habits.\n Accordingly, there is not a unique optimal gut microbiota composition since it is different for each individual.\n However, a healthy hostmicroorganism balance must be respected in order to optimally perform metabolic and immune functions and prevent disease development.\n This review will provide an overview of the studies that focus on gut microbiota balances in the same individual and between individuals and highlight the close mutualistic relationship between gut microbiota variations and diseases.\n Indeed, dysbiosis of gut microbiota is associated not only with intestinal disorders but also with numerous extra-intestinal diseases such as metabolic and neurological disorders.\n Understanding the cause or consequence of these gut microbiota balances in health and disease and how to maintain or restore a healthy gut microbiota

obese state can exert a multitude of stressors on the individual including anxiety and cognitive dysfunction.\n\n Though many studies have shown that exercise can alleviate the negative consequences of a HFD using metabolic readouts such as insulin and glucose, a paucity of well-controlled rodent studies have been published on HFD and exercise interactions with regard to behavioral outcomes.\n\n This is a critical issue since some individuals assume that HFD-induced behavioral problems such as anxiety and cognitive dysfunction can simply be exercised away.\n\n To investigate this, we analyzed mice fed a normal diet (ND), ND with exercise, HFD diet, or HFD with exercise.\n\n\nResults\nWe found that mice on a HFD had robust anxiety phenotypes but this was not rescued by exercise.\n\n Conversely, exercise increased cognitive abilities but this was not impacted by the HFD.\n\n Given the importance of the gut microbiome in shaping the host state, we used 16S rRNA hypervariable tag sequencing to profile our cohorts and found that HFD massively reshaped the gut microbial community in agreement with numerous published studies.\n\n However, exercise alone also caused massive shifts in the gut microbiome at nearly the same magnitude as diet but these changes were surprisingly orthogonal.\n\n Additionally, specific bacterial abundances were directly proportional to measures of anxiety or cognition.\n\n\nConclusions\nThus, behavioral domains and the gut microbiome are both impacted by diet and exercise but in unrelated ways.\n\n These data have important implications for obesity research aimed at modifications of the gut microbiome and suggest that specific gut microbes could be used as a biomarker for anxiety or cognition or perhaps even targeted for

microbial communities were recently identified as another possible source of risk and a potential therapeutic target.\n However, human and animal-model studies have yielded conflicting results about the precise nature of associations between microbiome composition and obesity.\n In this paper, we use publicly available data from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and MetaHIT, both surveys of healthy adults that include obese individuals, plus two smaller studies that specifically examined lean versus obese adults.\n We find that inter-study variability in the taxonomic composition of stool microbiomes far exceeds differences between lean and obese individuals within studies.\n Our analyses further reveal a high degree of variability in stool microbiome composition and diversity across individuals.\n While we confirm the previously published small, but statistically significant, differences in phylum-level taxonomic composition between lean and obese individuals in several cohorts, we find no association between BMI and taxonomic composition of stool microbiomes in the larger HMP and MetaHIT datasets.\n We explore a range of different statistical techniques and show that this result is robust to the choice of methodology.\n Differences between studies are likely due to a combination of technical and clinical factors.\n We conclude that there is no simple

sets.\n The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines were used to identify 10 studies for an updated and more synthetic analysis.\n Alpha diversity metrics and the relative risk of obesity based on those metrics were used to identify a limited number of significant associations with obesity; however, when the results of the studies were pooled by using a random-effect model, significant associations were observed among Shannon diversity, the number of observed operational taxonomic units, Shannon evenness, and obesity status.\n They were not observed for the ratio of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes or their individual relative abundances.\n Although these tests yielded small P values, the difference between the Shannon diversity indices of nonobese and obese individuals was 2.07%.\n A power analysis demonstrated that only one of the studies had sufficient power to detect a 5% difference in diversity.\n When random forest machine learning models were trained on one data set and then tested by using the other nine data sets, the median accuracy varied between 33.01 and 64.77% (median, 56.68%).\n Although there was support for a relationship

have allowed a deeper perspective into the molecular function of the human microbiota than has been achievable in the past.\n Here we aimed to examine the enzymes that cleave complex carbohydrates (CAZymes) in the human microbiome in order to determine (i) whether the CAZyme profiles of bacterial genomes are more similar within body sites or bacterial families and (ii) the sugar degradation and utilization capabilities of microbial communities inhabiting various human habitats.\n Upon examination of 493 bacterial references genomes from 12 human habitats, we found that sugar degradation capabilities of taxa are more similar to others in the same bacterial family than to those inhabiting the same habitat.\n Yet, the analysis of 520 metagenomic samples from five major body sites show that even when the community composition varies the CAZyme profiles are very similar within a body site, suggesting that the observed functional profile and microbial habitation have adapted to the local carbohydrate composition.\n When broad sugar utilization was compared within the five major body sites, the gastrointestinal track contained the highest potential for total sugar degradation, while dextran and peptidoglycan degradation were highest in oral and vaginal sites respectively.\n Our analysis suggests that the carbohydrate composition of each body site has a profound influence and probably constitutes one of the major driving forces that shapes the community composition and therefore the CAZyme profile of the local microbial communities, which in turn reflects the microbiome fitness to a body site.\n","id":"PMC3374616","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Brandi

by shaping the microbiota through a symbiotic relationship.\n In healthy human intestine, a constant homeostasis is maintained by the perfect regulation of microbial load and the immune response

inflammatory bowel diseases.\n It is evident that environment, genetics, and host immunity form a highly interactive regulatory triad that controls TLR function.\n Imbalanced relationships within this

and Producing Stable Changes in Lean Mass in Juvenile versus Adult Male F344 Rats","abstract":"The mammalian intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem that influences many aspects of host physiology.\n Exposure to specific microbes early in development affects host metabolism, immune function, and behavior across the lifespan.\n Just as the physiology of the developing organism undergoes a period of plasticity, the developing microbial ecosystem is characterized by instability and may also be more sensitive to change.\n Early life thus presents a window of opportunity for manipulations that produce adaptive changes in microbial composition.\n Recent insights have revealed that increasing physical activity can increase the abundance of beneficial microbial species.\n We therefore investigated whether six weeks of wheel running initiated in the juvenile period (postnatal day 24) would produce more robust and stable changes in microbial communities versus exercise initiated in adulthood (postnatal day 70) in male F344 rats.\n 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the microbial composition of juvenile versus adult runners and their sedentary counterparts across multiple time points during exercise and following exercise cessation.\n Alpha diversity measures revealed that the microbial communities of young runners were less even and diverse, a community structure that reflects volatility and malleability.\n Juvenile onset exercise altered several phyla and, notably, increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes, a configuration associated with leanness.\n At the genus level of taxonomy, exercise altered more genera in juveniles than in the adults and produced patterns associated with adaptive metabolic consequences.\n Given the potential of these changes to contribute to a lean phenotype, we examined body composition in juvenile versus adult runners.\n Interestingly, exercise produced persistent increases in lean body mass in juvenile but not adult runners.\n Taken together, these results indicate that the impact of exercise on gut microbiota composition as well as body composition may depend on the developmental stage during which exercise is initiated.\n","id":"PMC4446322","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n The role of physical fitness in the context of human intestinal microbiota is currently not known.\n\n We used high-throughput sequencing to analyze fecal microbiota of 39 healthy participants with similar age, BMI, and diets but with varying cardiorespiratory fitness levels.\n\n Fecal short-chain fatty acids were analyzed using gas chromatography.\n\n\nResults\nWe showed that peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), the gold standard measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, can account for more than 20 % of the variation in taxonomic richness, after accounting for all other factors, including diet.\n\n While VO2peak did not explain variation in beta diversity, it did play a significant role in explaining variation in the microbiomes predicted metagenomic functions, aligning positively with genes related to bacterial chemotaxis, motility, and fatty acid biosynthesis.\n\n These predicted functions were supported by measured increases in production of fecal butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid associated with improved gut health, amongst physically fit participants.\n\n We also identified increased abundances of key butyrate-producing taxa (Clostridiales, Roseburia, Lachnospiraceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae) amongst these individuals, which likely contributed to the observed increases in butyrate levels.\n\n\nConclusions\nResults from this study show that cardiorespiratory fitness is correlated with increased microbial diversity in healthy humans and that the associated changes are anchored around a set of functional cores rather than specific taxa.\n\n The microbial profiles of fit individuals favor the production of butyrate.\n\n As increased microbiota diversity and butyrate production is associated with overall host health, our findings warrant the use of exercise prescription as an adjuvant therapy in combating dysbiosis-associated diseases.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

endurance running, such as marathon running, on human gut microbial communities.\n Since many findings have shown that marathon running immediately causes metabolic changes in blood, urine, muscles and lymph that potentially impact the gut microbiota (GM) within several hours.\n Here, we investigated whether the GM immediately responds to the enteric changes in amateur half-marathon runners.\n Alterations in the metabolic profile and microbiota were investigated in fecal samples based on an untargeted metabolomics methodology and 16S rDNA sequencing analysis.\n A total of 40 fecal metabolites were found significantly changed after finishing a half-marathon race.\n The most significantly different metabolites were organic acids (the major increased metabolites) and nucleic acid components (the major decreased metabolites).\n The enteric changes induced by running did not affect the ?-diversity of the GM, but the abundances of certain microbiota members were shown to be significantly different before and after running.\n The family Coriobacteriaceae was identified as a potential biomarker that links exercise with health improvement.\n Functional prediction showed a significantly activated Cell motility function of GM within participants after running.\n Correlation analysis indicated that the observed differential GM in our study might have been the shared outcome of running and diet.\n This study provided knowledge regarding the health impacts of marathon running from the perspective of GM for the first time.\n Our data indicated that long-distance endurance running can immediately cause striking metabolic changes in the gut environment.\n Gut microbes can rapidly respond to the altered fecal metabolites by adjusting certain bacterial taxa.\n

well-known agent used for the treatment of numerous pathologies, such as obesity and hypertension; it has recently been demonstrated to shape gut microbiota consortia.\n\n Since exercise-altered

Ovariectomized Female Rats Selectively Bred for High and Low Aerobic Capacity","abstract":"The gut microbiota is considered a relevant factor in obesity and associated metabolic diseases, for which postmenopausal women are particularly at risk.\n Increasing physical activity has been recognized as an efficacious approach to prevent or treat obesity, yet the impact of physical activity on the microbiota remains under-investigated.\n We examined the impacts of voluntary exercise on host metabolism and gut microbiota in ovariectomized (OVX) high capacity (HCR) and low capacity running (LCR) rats.\n HCR and LCR rats (age = 27wk) were OVX and fed a high-fat diet (45% kcal fat) ad libitum and housed in cages equipped with (exercise, EX) or without (sedentary, SED) running wheels for 11wk (n = 7-8/group).\n We hypothesized that increased physical activity would hinder weight gain, increase metabolic health and shift the microbiota of LCR rats, resulting in populations more similar to that of HCR rats.\n Animals were compared for characteristic metabolic parameters including body composition, lipid profile and energy expenditure; whereas cecal digesta were collected for DNA extraction.\n 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon Illumina MiSeq sequencing was performed, followed by analysis using QIIME 1.8.0 to assess cecal microbiota.\n Voluntary exercise decreased body and fat mass, and normalized fasting NEFA concentrations of LCR rats, despite only running one-third the distance of HCR rats.\n Exercise, however, increased food intake, weight gain and fat mass of HCR rats.\n Exercise clustered the gut microbial community of LCR rats, which separated them from the other groups.\n Assessments of specific taxa revealed significant (p&lt;0.05) line by exercise interactions including shifts in the abundances of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Cyanobacteria.\n Relative abundance of Christensenellaceae family was higher (p = 0.026) in HCR than LCR rats, and positively correlated (p&lt;0.05) with food intake, body weight and running distance.\n These findings demonstrate that exercise differentially impacts host metabolism and gut microbial communities of female HCR and LCR rats without ovarian function.\n","id":"PMC4547806","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Exercise training increased the relative abundance of Butyricimonas and Akkermansia.\n Additionally, key operational taxonomic units were identified, including 24 lineages (mainly from Bacteroidetes, Barnesiella, Helicobacter, Parabacteroides, Porphyromonadaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Ureaplasma) that were closely related to exercise and cardiac function.\n These results suggested that exercise

Endurance Exercise Alters Gut Metagenome That Is not Reflected in Systemic Metabolism in Over-weight Women","abstract":"Recent studies suggest that exercise alters the gut microbiome.\n We determined whether six-weeks endurance exercise, without changing diet, affected the gut metagenome and systemic metabolites of overweight women.\n Previously sedentary overweight women (n = 19) underwent a six-weeks endurance exercise intervention, but two were excluded due to antibiotic therapy.\n The gut microbiota composition and functions were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metagenomics.\n Body composition was analyzed with DXA X-ray densitometer and serum metabolomics with NMR metabolomics.\n Total energy and energy-yielding nutrient intakes were analyzed from food records using Micro-Nutrica software.\n Serum clinical variables were determined with KONELAB instrument.\n Soluble Vascular Adhesion Protein 1 (VAP-1) was measured with ELISA and its' enzymatic activity as produced hydrogen peroxide.\n The exercise intervention was effective, as maximal power and maximum rate of oxygen consumption increased while android fat mass decreased.\n No changes in diet were observed.\n Metagenomic analysis revealed taxonomic shifts including an increase in Akkermansia and a decrease in Proteobacteria.\n These changes were independent of age, weight, fat % as well as energy and fiber intake.\n Training slightly increased Jaccard distance of genus level ?-diversity.\n Training did not alter the enriched metagenomic pathways, which, according to Bray Curtis dissimilarity analysis, may have been due to that only half of the subjects' microbiomes responded considerably to exercise.\n Nevertheless, tranining decreased the abundance of several genes including those related to fructose and amino acid metabolism.\n These metagenomic changes, however, were not translated into major systemic metabolic changes as only two metabolites, phospholipids and cholesterol in large VLDL particles, decreased after exercise.\n Training also decreased the amine oxidase activity of pro-inflammatory VAP-1, whereas no changes in CRP were detected.\n All clinical blood variables were within normal range, yet exercise slightly increased glucose and decreased LDL and HDL.\n In conclusion, exercise training modified the gut microbiome without greatly affecting systemic metabolites or body composition.\n Based on our data and existing literature, we propose that especially Akkermansia and Proteobacteria are exercise-responsive taxa.\n Our results warrant the need for further studies in larger cohorts to determine whether exercise types other than endurance exercise also modify the gut metagenome.\n","id":"PMC6178902","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

have been solely considered as toxic species resulting in oxidative stress, pathogenesis and aging.\n However, there is now clear evidence that ROS are not merely toxic species but alsowithin certain concentrationsuseful signaling molecules regulating physiological processes.\n During intense skeletal muscle contractile activity myotubes' mitochondria generate high ROS flows: this renders skeletal muscle a tissue where ROS hold a particular relevance.\n According to their hormetic nature, in muscles ROS may trigger different signaling pathways leading to diverging responses, from adaptation to cell death.\n Whether a positive or negative response will prevail depends on many variables such as, among others, the site of ROS production, the persistence of ROS flow or target cells' antioxidant status.\n In this light, a specific threshold of physiological ROS concentrations above which ROS exert negative, toxic effects is hard to determine, and the concept of physiologically compatible levels of ROS would better fit with such a dynamic scenario.\n In this review these concepts will be discussed along with the most relevant signaling pathways triggered

it to be comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility of a new route for therapeutic intervention.\n Moreover, it might be more accurate to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease.\n This review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and colorectal cancer.\n The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these disorders is

antioxidants, has been described in several patho-physiological conditions, including cardiovascular, neurological diseases and cancer, thus impacting on individuals lifelong health.\n Diet, environmental pollution, and physical activity can play a significant role in the oxidative balance of an organism.\n Even if physical training has proved to be able to counteract the negative effects caused by free radicals and to provide many health benefits, it is also known that intensive physical activity induces oxidative stress, inflammation, and free radical-mediated muscle damage.\n Indeed, variations in type, intensity, and duration of exercise training can activate different patterns of oxidantantioxidant balance leading to different responses in terms of molecular and cellular damage.\n The aim of the present review is to discuss (1) the role of oxidative status in athletes in relation to exercise training practice, (2) the implications for muscle damage, (3) the long-term effect for neurodegenerative disease manifestations, (4) the role of antioxidant supplementations in preventing oxidative

time, previous studies showed that people reduce salutogenic behaviours such as physical activity and healthy eating in the face of stress and negative affect while increasing such behaviours in the context of positive affect.\n\n Due to daily fluctuations of these behaviours, the present study examined these relationships in daily life using ecological momentary assessment (EMA).\n\n\nDesign and methods\nFifty?one university students responded to six daily prompts during 7 days via smartphone?based EMA.\n\n Items examined stress, emotional experience, physical activity duration, and healthy eating.\n\n\nResults\nHigher stress and negative affect, as well as lower positive affect, were related to a reduction in subsequent physical activity.\n\n Higher physical activity levels, in turn, were associated with less subsequent stress and negative affect, as well as more positive affect.\n\n No such effects for stress and affect on healthy eating or vice versa were found.\n\n\nConclusions\nEngaging in physical activity is related to better mood and less stress/negative affect over the next several hours in daily life.\n\n Prevention efforts therefore may benefit by focusing on promoting physical activity, particularly when stress/negative affect is high to break the cycle of inactivity, stress, and negative affect.\n\n Potential effects of healthy eating

(b) as activities performed in everyday life are mostly spontaneous and unconscious, an objective assessment of physical activity is useful; (c) given that recall of affective states is often affected by systematic distortions, real-time assessment is preferable.\n In sum, we suggest the use of ambulatory assessment techniques, and more specifically the combination of accelerometer-assessment of physical activity with an electronic diary assessment of the momentary affective state and additional context information.\n Second, we summarize 22 empirical studies published between 1980 and 2012 using ambulatory assessment to investigate within-subject associations between momentary affective states and physical activity in everyday life.\n Generally, the literature overview detects a positive association, which appears stronger among those studies that were of high methodological quality.\n Third, we propose the use of ambulatory assessment intervention (AAIs) strategies to change peoples behavior and to enable people to be active as often as possible during the day (e.\ng.\n, reducing sitting time, taking more steps per day).\n","id":"PMC3638123","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Martina K.","surname":"Kanning","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ulrich W.","surname":"Ebner-Priemer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wolfgang Michael","surname":"Schlicht","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Role of Tryptophan Metabolism in Mood, Behavior, and Cognition","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jand.2015.12.006","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine: Nutrition and Athletic Performance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3390/nu11040923","date":"2019-04-17","title":"Precision Nutrition and the Microbiome, Part I: Current State of the Science","abstract":"The gut microbiota is a highly complex community which evolves and adapts to its host over a lifetime.\n It has been described as a virtual organ owing to the myriad of functions it performs, including the production of bioactive metabolites, regulation of immunity, energy homeostasis and protection against pathogens.\n These activities are dependent on the quantity and quality of the microbiota alongside its metabolic potential, which are dictated by a number of factors, including diet and host genetics.\n In this regard, the gut microbiome is malleable and varies significantly from host to host.\n These two features render the gut microbiome a candidate organ for the possibility of precision microbiomicsthe use of the gut microbiome as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to specific dietary constituents to generate precision diets and interventions for optimal health.\n With this in mind, this two-part review investigates the current state of the science in terms of the influence of diet and specific dietary components on the gut microbiota and subsequent consequences for health status, along with opportunities to modulate the microbiota for improved health and the potential of the microbiome as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to dietary components.\n In particular, in Part I, we examine the development of the microbiota from birth and its role in health.\n We investigate the consequences of poor-quality diet in relation to infection and inflammation and discuss diet-derived microbial metabolites which negatively impact health.\n We look at the role of diet in shaping the microbiome and the influence of specific dietary components, namely protein, fat and carbohydrates, on gut microbiota composition.\n","id":"PMC6520976","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Mills","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Catherine","surname":"Stanton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jonathan A.","surname":"Lane","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Graeme J.","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R.

and Intestinal Immune-related Function in Weaned Piglets Fed Protein Restricted Diet","abstract":"As a novel approach for disease control and prevention, nutritional modulation of the intestinal health has been proved.\n However, It is still unknown whether branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) is needed to maintain intestinal immune-related function.\n The objective of this study was to determine whether BCAA supplementation in protein restricted diet affects growth performance, intestinal barrier function and modulates post-weaning gut disorders.\n One hundred and eight weaned piglets (7.96±0.26 kg) were randomly fed one of the three diets including a control diet (21% crude protein [CP], CON), a protein restricted diet (17% CP, PR) and a BCAA diet (BCAA supplementation in the PR diet) for 14 d.\n The growth performance, plasma amino acid concentrations, small intestinal morphology and intestinal immunoglobulins were tested.\n First, average daily gain (ADG) (p&lt;0.05) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) (p&lt;0.05) of weaned pigs in PR group were lower, while gain:feed ratio was lower than the CON group (p&lt;0.05).\n Compared with PR group, BCAA group improved ADG (p&lt;0.05), ADFI (p&lt;0.05) and feed:gain ratio (p&lt;0.05) of piglets.\n The growth performance data between CON and BCAA groups was not different (p&gt;0.05).\n The PR and BCAA treatments had a higher (p&lt;0.05) plasma concentration of methionine and threonine than the CON treatment.\n The level of some essential and functional amino acids (such as arginine, phenylalanine, histidine, glutamine etc.\n) in plasma of the PR group was lower (p&lt;0.05) than that of the CON group.\n Compared with CON group, BCAA supplementation significantly increased BCAA concentrations (p&lt;0.01) and decreased urea concentration (p&lt;0.01) in pig plasma indicating that the efficiency of dietary nitrogen utilization was increased.\n Compared with CON group, the small intestine of piglets fed PR diet showed villous atrophy, increasing of intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs) number (p&lt;0.05) and declining of the immunoglobulin concentration, including jejunal immunoglobulin A (IgA) (p = 0.04), secreted IgA (sIgA) (p = 0.03) and immunoglobulin M (p = 0.08), and ileal IgA (p = 0.01) and immunoglobulin G (p = 0.08).\n The BCAA supplementation increased villous height in the duodenum (p&lt;0.01), reversed the trend of an increasing IELs number.\n Notably, BCAA supplementation increased levels of jejunal and ileal immunoglobulin mentioned above.\n In conclusion, BCAA supplementation to protein restricted diet improved intestinal immune defense function by protecting villous morphology and by increasing levels of intestinal immunoglobulins in weaned piglets.\n Our finding has the important implication that BCAA may be used to reduce the negative effects of a protein restricted diet on growth performance and intestinal immunity in weaned piglets.\n","id":"PMC4647083","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Asian-Australasian Association of Animal Production Societies (AAAP) and Korean Society of Animal Science and Technology

induction, mice received, or not, either 1% Gln or 2.5% BCAA (Leu, Ile, Val) for one week in drinking water.\n Results: Neither Gln nor BCAA supplementation affected body weight and body composition, while only Gln supplementation slightly increased food intake.\n ABA mice exhibited increased paracellular permeability and reduced protein synthesis in the colonic mucosa.\n Oral Gln restored colonic paracellular permeability and protein synthesis and increased the mucin-2 mRNA level, whereas BCAA did not affect colonic parameters.\n Conclusion: In conclusion, oral Gln specifically improves

whether Gln may modulate molecular pathways in key tissues linked to the insulin action in rats.\n Thirty-nine overweight/obese volunteers received 30 g of Gln or alanine (Ala-control) for 14 days.\n Body weight (BW), waist circumference (WC), hormones, and pro-inflammatory markers were evaluated.\n To investigate molecular mechanisms, Gln or Ala was given to Wistar rats on a high-fat diet (HFD), and metabolic parameters, euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with tracers, and Western blot were done.\n Gln reduced WC and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in overweight volunteers.\n In the obese group, Gln diminished WC and serum insulin.\n There was a positive correlation between the reduction on WC and LPS.\n In rats on HFD, Gln reduced adiposity, improved insulin action and signaling, and reversed both defects in glucose metabolism in the liver and muscle.\n Gln supplementation increased muscle glucose uptake and reversed the increased hepatic glucose production, in parallel with a reduced glucose uptake in adipose tissue.\n This insulin resistance in AT was accompanied by enhanced IRS1 O-linked-glycosamine association in this tissue, but not in the liver and muscle.\n These data suggest that Gln supplementation leads to insulin resistance specifically in adipose tissue via the hexosamine pathway and reduces adipose mass, which is associated with improvement in the systemic insulin action.\n Thus, further investigation with Gln supplementation should be performed for longer periods in humans before prescribing as a beneficial therapeutic approach for individuals who are overweight and obese.\n","id":"PMC6471297","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Kahlile

characterized by low bone mass and microarchitecture deterioration of bone tissue, leading to enhanced bone fragility and consequent increase in fracture risk.\n Evidence is accumulating for an important role of calcium deficiency as the process of aging is associated with disturbed calcium balance.\n Vitamin D is the principal factor that maintains calcium homeostasis.\n Increasing evidence indicates that the reason for disturbed calcium balance with age is inadequate vitamin D levels in the elderly.\n In this article, an overview of our current understanding of vitamin D, its metabolism, and mechanisms involved in vitamin D-mediated maintenance of calcium homeostasis is presented.\n In addition, mechanisms involved in age-related dysregulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 action, recommended daily doses of vitamin D and calcium, and the use of vitamin D analogs for the treatment of osteoporosis (which remains controversial) are reviewed.\n Elucidation of the molecular pathways of vitamin D action and modifications that occur with aging will be an active area of future research that has the potential to reveal new therapeutic strategies to maintain calcium

and Bone Health in Postmenopausal Women: Role of Protein and Vitamin D Supplementation Combined with Exercise Training","abstract":"Menopause is an age-dependent physiological condition associated with a natural decline in oestrogen levels, which causes a progressive decrease of muscle mass and strength and bone density.\n Sarcopenia and osteoporosis often coexist in elderly people, with a prevalence of the latter in elderly women.\n The profound interaction between muscle and bone induces a negative resonance between the two tissues affected by these disorders worsening the quality of life in the postmenopausal period.\n It has been estimated that at least 1 in 3 women over age 50 will experience osteoporotic fractures, often requiring hospitalisation and long-term care, causing a large financial burden to health insurance systems.\n Hormonal replacement therapy is effective in osteoporosis prevention, but concerns have been raised with regard to its safety.\n On the whole, the increase in life expectancy for postmenopausal women along with the need to improve their quality of life makes it necessary to develop specific and safe therapeutic strategies, alternative to hormonal replacement therapy, targeting both sarcopenia and osteoporosis progression.\n This review will examine the rationale and the effects of dietary protein, vitamin D and calcium supplementation combined with a specifically-designed exercise training prescription as a strategy to counteract these postmenopausal-associated

attributed immunomodulatory properties.\n\n It positively influences human health, but in vivo data describing vitamin D effects on the human gut microbiome are missing.\n\n We aimed to investigate the effects of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on the human mucosa-associated and stool microbiome as well as CD8+ T cells in healthy volunteers.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was an interventional, open-label, pilot study.\n\n Sixteen healthy volunteers (7 females, 9 males) were endoscopically examined to access a total of 7 sites.\n\n We sampled stomach, small bowel, colon, and stools before and after 8 weeks of vitamin D3 supplementation.\n\n Bacterial composition was assessed by pyrosequencing the 16S rRNA gene (V12), and CD8+ T cell counts were determined by flow cytometry.\n\n\nResults\nVitamin D3 supplementation changed the gut microbiome in the upper GI tract (gastric corpus, antrum, and duodenum).\n\n We found a decreased relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria including Pseudomonas spp.\n\n and Escherichia/Shigella spp.\n\n and increased bacterial richness.\n\n No major changes occurred in the terminal ileum, appendiceal orifice, ascending colon, and sigmoid colon or in stools, but the CD8+ T cell fraction was significantly increased in the terminal ileum.\n\n\nConclusion\nVitamin D3 modulates the gut microbiome of the upper GI tract which might explain its positive influence on gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease or bacterial infections.\n\n The local effects of vitamin D demonstrate pronounced regional differences in the response of the GI microbiome to external factors, which should be considered in future studies investigating the human microbiome.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary

and gut microbiota in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes: a pilot randomized trial","abstract":"Background\nNutrition therapy is the cornerstone of treating diabetes mellitus.\n\n The inclusion of fish (particularly oily fish) at least two times per week is recommended by current international dietary guidelines for type 2 diabetes.\n\n In contrast to a large number of human studies examining the effects of oily fish on different cardiovascular risk factors, little research on this topic is available in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n The aims of this pilot study were to investigate the effects of a sardine-enriched diet on metabolic control, adiponectin, inflammatory markers, erythrocyte membrane fatty acid (EMFA) composition, and gut microbiota in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nMethods\n35 drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to follow either a type 2 diabetes standard diet (control group: CG), or a standard diet enriched with 100 g of sardines 5 days a week (sardine group: SG) for 6 months.\n\n Anthropometric, dietary information, fasting glycated hemoglobin, glucose, insulin, adiponectin, inflammatory markers, EMFA and specific bacterial strains were determined before and after intervention.\n\n\nResults\nThere were no significant differences in glycemic control between groups at the end of the study.\n\n Both groups decreased plasma insulin (SG: ?35.3 %, P?=?0.01, CG: ?22.6 %, P?=?0.02) and homeostasis model of assessment - insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (SG: ?39.2 %, P?=?0.007, CG: ?21.8 %, P?=?0.04) at 6-months from baseline.\n\n However only SG increased adiponectin in plasma compared to baseline level (+40.7 %, P?=?0.04).\n\n The omega-3 index increased 2.6 % in the SG compared to 0.6 % in the CG (P?=?0.001).\n\n Both dietary interventions decreased phylum Firmicutes (SG and CG: P?=?0.04) and increased E.\n\n coli concentrations (SG: P?=?0.01, CG: P?=?0.03) at the end of the study from baseline, whereas SG decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (P?=?0.04) and increased Bacteroides-Prevotella (P?=?0.004) compared to baseline.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough enriching diet with 100 g of sardines 5 days a week during 6 months to a type 2 diabetes standard diet seems to have neutral effects on glycemic control in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes, this nutritional intervention could have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk.\n\n Furthermore, both dietary interventions decreased HOMA-IR and altered gut microbiota composition of drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nTrial registration\nTrial number and name of the registry: NCT02294526, ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

of carbohydrates (prebiotic fibers), the impact of dietary fats, such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), on the gut microbiota is less well defined.\n The few studies completed in adults showed some common changes in the gut microbiota after omega-3 PUFA supplementation.\n In particular, a decrease in Faecalibacterium, often associated with an increase in the Bacteroidetes and butyrate-producing bacteria belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family, has been observed.\n Coincidentally, a dysbiosis of these taxa is found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\n Omega-3 PUFAs can exert a positive action by reverting the microbiota composition in these diseases, and increase the production of anti-inflammatory compounds, like short-chain fatty acids.\n In addition, accumulating evidence in animal model studies indicates that the interplay between gut microbiota, omega-3 fatty acids, and immunity helps to maintain the intestinal wall integrity and interacts with host immune cells.\n Finally, human and animal studies have highlighted the ability of omega-3 PUFAs to influence the gutbrain axis, acting through gut microbiota composition.\n From these findings, the importance of the omega-3 connection to the microbiota emerges, encouraging further studies.\n","id":"PMC5751248","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Lara","surname":"Costantini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Romina","surname":"Molinari","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Romina","surname":"Molinari","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Barbara","surname":"Farinon","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Barbara","surname":"Farinon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicolò","surname":"Merendino","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1152/ajpgi.00419.2010","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Fructose-maltodextrin

performance have been carried out on men.\n However, the differences between sexes are evident in terms of body size, body composition, and hormonal functioning, which might cause different outcomes on performance for the same dosage of caffeine intake in men vs.\n women.\n The main aim of this systematic review was to analyze and compare the effects of caffeine intake between men and women on sports performance to provide a source of knowledge to sports practitioners and coaches, especially for those working with women athletes, on the use of caffeine as an ergogenic aid.\n A structured search was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in the Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases until 28 July 2019. The search included studies in which the effects of caffeine supplementation on athletic performance were compared between sexes and to an identical placebo situation (dose, duration and timing).\n No filters were applied for participants physical fitness level or age.\n A total of 254 articles were obtained in the initial search.\n When applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final sample was 10 articles.\n The systematic review concluded that four investigations (100% of the number of investigations on this topic) had not found differences between sexes in terms of caffeine supplementation on aerobic performance and 3/3 (100%) on the fatigue index.\n However, four out of seven articles (57.1%) showed that the ergogenicity of caffeine for anaerobic performance was higher in men than women.\n In particular, it seems that men are able to produce more power, greater total weight lifted and more speed with the same dose of caffeine than women.\n In summary, caffeine supplementation produced a similar ergogenic benefit for aerobic performance and the fatigue index in men and women athletes.\n Nevertheless, the effects of caffeine to produce more power, total weight lifted and to improve sprint performance with respect to a placebo was higher in men than women athletes despite the same dose of caffeine being administered.\n Thus, the ergogenic effect of acute caffeine intake on anaerobic performance might be higher in men than in women.\n ","id":"PMC6835847","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Juan","surname":"Mielgo-Ayuso","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Diego","surname":"Marques-Jiménez","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Diego","surname":"Marques-Jiménez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ignacio","surname":"Refoyo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juan","surname":"Del Coso","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patxi","surname":"León-Guereño","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Patxi","surname":"León-Guereño","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Julio","surname":"Calleja-González","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Julio","surname":"Calleja-González","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.01.011","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Impact of coffee consumption on the gut microbiota: A human volunteer study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0153134","date":"2016-03-24","title":"Long-Term Green Tea Supplementation Does Not Change the Human Gut Microbiota","abstract":"Background\nGreen tea catechins may play a role in body weight regulation through interactions with the gut microbiota.\n\n\nAim\nWe examined whether green tea supplementation for 12 weeks induces changes in composition of the human gut microbiota.\n\n\nMethods\n58 Caucasian men and women were included in a randomized, placebo-controlled design.\n\n For 12 weeks, subjects consumed either green tea (&gt;0.56 g/d epigallocatechin-gallate + 0.28 ? 0.45 g/d caffeine) or placebo capsules.\n\n Fecal samples were collected twice (baseline, vs.\n\n week 12) for analyses of total bacterial profiles by means of IS-profiling, a 16S-23S interspacer region-based profiling method.\n\n\nResults\nNo significant changes between baseline and week 12 in subjects receiving green tea or placebo capsules, and no significant interactions between treatment (green tea or placebo) and time (baseline and week 12) were observed for body composition.\n\n Analysis of the fecal samples in subjects receiving green tea and placebo showed similar bacterial diversity and community structures, indicating there were no significant changes in bacterial diversity between baseline and week 12 in subjects receiving green tea capsules or in subjects receiving placebo capsules.\n\n No significant interactions were observed between treatment (green tea or placebo) and time (baseline and week 12) for the gut microbial diversity.\n\n Although, there were no significant differences between normal weight and overweight subjects in response to green tea, we did observe a reduced bacterial alpha diversity in overweight as compared to normal weight subjects (p = 0.002).\n\n\nConclusion\nGreen tea supplementation for 12 weeks did not have a significant effect on composition of the gut microbiota.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nClinicalTrials.\n\ngov NCT01556321\n","id":"PMC4824458","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Pilou L.

difficult to determine whether it is a causal risk factor, and whether treatment of depression can improve cardiac outcomes.\n\n In addition, research on biobehavioral mechanisms has not yet produced a definitive causal model of the relationship between depression and cardiac outcomes.\n\n\nDiscussion\nKey challenges in this line of research concern the measurement of depression, the definition and relevance of certain subtypes of depression, the temporal relationship between depression and CHD, underlying biobehavioral mechanisms, and depression treatment efficacy.\n\n\nSummary\nThis article examines some of the methodological challenges that will have to be overcome in order to determine whether depression should be regarded as a key target of secondary prevention in

potential moderator of ovarian hormone influences on binge eating in women","abstract":"Previous research has demonstrated significant associations between increased levels of ovarian hormones and increased rates of binge eating (BE) in women.\n However, whereas all women experience fluctuations in ovarian hormones across the menstrual cycle, not all women binge eat in response to these fluctuations, suggesting that other factors must contribute.\n Stress is one potential contributing factor.\n Specifically, it may be that hormone-BE associations are stronger in women who experience high levels of stress, particularly as stress has been shown to be a precipitant to BE episodes in women.\n To date, no studies have directly examined stress as a moderator of hormone-BE associations, but indirect data (that is, associations between BE and stress and between ovarian hormones and stress) could provide initial clues about moderating effects.\n Given the above, the purpose of this narrative review was to evaluate these indirect data and their promise for understanding the role of stress in hormone-BE associations.\n Studies examining associations between all three phenotypes (that is, ovarian hormones, stress, and BE) in animals and humans were reviewed to provide the most thorough and up-to-date review of the literature on the potential moderating effects of stress on ovarian hormoneBE associations.\n Overall, current evidence suggests that associations between hormones and BE may be stronger in women with high stress levels, possibly via altered hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis response to stress and increased sensitivity to and altered effects of ovarian hormones during stress.\n Additional studies are necessary to directly examine stress as a moderator of ovarian hormoneBE associations and identify the mechanisms underlying these effects.\n","id":"PMC6396839","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"F1000 Research

randomised controlled trial of an adjunctive dietary intervention in the treatment of moderate to severe depression.\n\n The intervention consisted of seven individual nutritional consulting sessions delivered by a clinical dietician.\n\n The control condition comprised a social support protocol to the same visit schedule and length.\n\n Depression symptomatology was the primary endpoint, assessed using the MontgomeryÅsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at 12 weeks.\n\n Secondary outcomes included remission and change of symptoms, mood and anxiety.\n\n Analyses utilised a likelihood-based mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach.\n\n The robustness of estimates was investigated through sensitivity analyses.\n\n\nResults\nWe assessed 166 individuals for eligibility, of whom 67 were enrolled (diet intervention, n?=?33; control, n?=?34).\n\n Of these, 55 were utilising some form of therapy: 21 were using psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy combined; 9 were using exclusively psychotherapy; and 25 were using only pharmacotherapy.\n\n There were 31 in the diet support group and 25 in the social support control group who had complete data at 12 weeks.\n\n The dietary support

in depression-like behavior after myocardial infarction (MI).\n Several experimental approaches that reduce inflammation also result in attenuation of depressive symptoms.\n We have demonstrated that Resolvin D1 (RvD1), a metabolite of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) derived from docosahexaenoic acid, diminishes infarct size and neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic myocardium.\n The aim of this study is to determine if a single RvD1 injection could alleviate depressive symptoms in a rat model of MI.\n MI was induced in rats by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 40 min.\n Five minutes before ischemia or after reperfusion, 0.1 ?g of RvD1 or vehicle was injected in the left ventricle cavity.\n Fourteen days after MI, behavioral tests (forced swim test and socialization) were conducted to evaluate depression-like symptoms.\n RvD1 reduced infarct size in the treated vs.\n the vehicle group.\n Animals receiving RvD1 also showed better performance in the forced swim and social interaction tests vs.\n vehicle controls.\n These results indicate that a single RvD1 dose, given 5 min before occlusion or 5 min after the onset of reperfusion, decreases infarct size and attenuates depression-like symptoms.\n","id":"PMC4245537","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Kim","surname":"Gilbert","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Judith","surname":"Bernier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roger","surname":"Godbout","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guy","surname":"Rousseau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Constantina","surname":"Nasopoulou","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Constantina","surname":"Nasopoulou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00213-017-4774-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Resolvin

of Depressive Disorders: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials","abstract":"Background\nDespite omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) supplementation in depressed patients have been suggested to improve depressive symptomatology, previous findings are not univocal.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo conduct an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of omega-3 PUFA treatment of depressive disorders, taking into account the clinical differences among patients included in the studies.\n\n\nMethods\nA search on MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Database of RCTs using omega-3 PUFA on patients with depressive symptoms published up to August 2013 was performed.\n\n Standardized mean difference in clinical measure of depression severity was primary outcome.\n\n Type of omega-3 used (particularly eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and omega-3 as mono- or adjuvant therapy was also examined.\n\n Meta-regression analyses assessed the effects of study size, baseline depression severity, trial duration, dose of omega-3, and age of patients.\n\n\nResults\nMeta-analysis of 11 and 8 trials conducted respectively on patients with a DSM-defined diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and patients with depressive symptomatology but no diagnosis of MDD demonstrated significant clinical benefit of omega-3 PUFA treatment compared to placebo (standardized difference in random-effects model 0.56 SD [95% CI: 0.20, 0.92] and 0.22 SD [95% CI: 0.01, 0.43], respectively; pooled analysis was 0.38 SD [95% CI: 0.18, 0.59]).\n\n Use of mainly EPA within the preparation, rather than DHA, influenced final clinical efficacy.\n\n Significant clinical efficacy had the use of omega-3 PUFA as adjuvant rather than mono-therapy.\n\n No relation between efficacy and study size, baseline depression severity, trial duration, age of patients, and study quality was found.\n\n Omega-3 PUFA resulted effective in RCTs on patients with bipolar disorder, whereas no evidence was found for those exploring their efficacy on depressive symptoms in young populations, perinatal depression, primary disease other than depression and healthy subjects.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe use of omega-3 PUFA is effective in patients with diagnosis of MDD and on depressive patients without diagnosis of MDD.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4013121","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

supplementation for major depressive disorder","abstract":"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation has been proposed as (adjuvant) treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD).\n In the present meta-analysis, we pooled randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on depressive symptoms in MDD.\n Moreover, we performed meta-regression to test whether supplementation effects depended on eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid dose, their ratio, study duration, participants' age, percentage antidepressant users, baseline MDD symptom severity, publication year and study quality.\n To limit heterogeneity, we only included studies in adult patients with MDD assessed using standardized clinical interviews, and excluded studies that specifically studied perinatal/perimenopausal or comorbid MDD.\n Our PubMED/EMBASE search resulted in 1955 articles, from which we included 13 studies providing 1233 participants.\n After taking potential publication bias into account, meta-analysis showed an overall beneficial effect of omega-3 PUFAs on depressive symptoms in MDD (standardized mean difference=0.398 (0.1140.682), P=0.006, random-effects model).\n As an explanation for significant heterogeneity (I2=73.36, P&lt;0.001), meta-regression showed that higher EPA dose (?=0.00037 (0.000090.00065), P=0.009), higher percentage antidepressant users (?=0.0058 (0.000170.01144), P=0.044) and earlier publication year (?=?0.0735 (?0.143 to 0.004), P=0.04) were significantly associated with better outcome for PUFA supplementation.\n Additional sensitivity analyses were performed.\n In conclusion, present meta-analysis suggested a beneficial overall effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in MDD patients, especially for higher doses of EPA and in participants taking antidepressants.\n Future precision medicine trials should establish whether possible interactions between EPA and antidepressants could provide targets to improve antidepressant response and its prediction.\n Furthermore, potential long-term biochemical side effects of high-dosed add-on EPA supplementation should be carefully monitored.\n","id":"PMC4872453","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"R J

corticostriatal reward circuitry in depression","abstract":"Depression is associated with alterations in corticostriatal reward circuitry.\n One pathophysiological pathway that may drive these changes is inflammation.\n Biomarkers of inflammation (for example, cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP)) are reliably elevated in depressed patients.\n Moreover, administration of inflammatory stimuli reduces neural activity and dopamine release in reward-related brain regions in association with reduced motivation and anhedonia.\n Accordingly, we examined whether increased inflammation in depression affects corticostriatal reward circuitry to lead to deficits in motivation and goal-directed motor behavior.\n Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted on 48 medically stable, unmedicated outpatients with major depression.\n Whole-brain, voxel-wise functional connectivity was examined as a function of CRP using seeds for subdivisions of the ventral and dorsal striatum associated with motivation and motor control.\n Increased CRP was associated with decreased connectivity between ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (corrected P&lt;0.05), which in turn correlated with increased anhedonia (R=?0.47, P=0.001).\n Increased CRP similarly predicted decreased dorsal striatal to vmPFC and presupplementary motor area connectivity, which correlated with decreased motor speed (R=0.31 to 0.45, P&lt;0.05) and increased psychomotor slowing (R=?0.35, P=0.015).\n Of note, mediation analyses revealed that these effects of CRP on connectivity mediated significant relationships between CRP and anhedonia and motor slowing.\n Finally, connectivity between striatum and vmPFC was associated with increased plasma interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta and IL-1 receptor antagonist (R=?0.33 to ?0.36, P&lt;0.05).\n These findings suggest that decreased corticostriatal connectivity may serve as a target for anti-inflammatory or pro-dopaminergic treatment strategies to improve motivational and motor deficits in patients with increased inflammation, including depression.\n","id":"PMC4862934","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"J

an RCT","abstract":"Lowering elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations by supplementing vitamin B12 and folic acid may reduce depressive symptoms and improve health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in older adults.\n This study aimed to test this hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial.\n Participants (N = 2919, ?65 years, Hcy concentrations ?12 µmol/L) received either 500 µg vitamin B12 and 400 µg folic acid daily or placebo for two years.\n Both tablets contained 15 µg vitamin D3.\n Depressive symptoms were measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15).\n HR-QoL was assessed with the SF-12 Mental and Physical component summary scores and the EQ-5D Index score and Visual Analogue Scale.\n Differences in two-year change scores were analyzed with Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA).\n Hcy concentrations decreased more in the intervention group, but two-year change scores of the GDS-15 and three of four HR-QoL measures did not differ between groups.\n The EQ-5D Index score declined less in the intervention group than in the placebo group (mean change 0.00 vs.\n ?0.02, p = 0.004).\n In conclusion, two-year supplementation with vitamin B12 and folic acid in older adults with hyperhomocysteinemia showed that lowering Hcy concentrations does not reduce depressive symptoms, but it may have a small positive effect on HR-QoL.\n","id":"PMC5133130","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Elisa J.","surname":"de Koning","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nikita

life in overweight/obese postmenopausal women: a randomized controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nAlthough lifestyle interventions targeting multiple lifestyle behaviors are more effective in preventing unhealthy weight gain and chronic diseases than intervening on a single behavior, few studies have compared individual and combined effects of diet and/or exercise interventions on health-related quality of life (HRQOL).\n\n In addition, the mechanisms of how these lifestyle interventions affect HRQOL are unknown.\n\n The primary aim of this study was to examine the individual and combined effects of dietary weight loss and/or exercise interventions on HRQOL and psychosocial factors (depression, anxiety, stress, social support).\n\n The secondary aim was to investigate predictors of changes in HRQOL.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study was a randomized controlled trial.\n\n Overweight/obese postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to 12 months of dietary weight loss (n = 118), moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise (225 minutes/week, n = 117), combined diet and exercise (n = 117), or control (n = 87).\n\n Demographic, health and anthropometric information, aerobic fitness, HRQOL (SF-36), stress (Perceived Stress Scale), depression [Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)-18], anxiety (BSI-18) and social support (Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey) were assessed at baseline and 12 months.\n\n The 12-month changes in HRQOL and psychosocial factors were compared using analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline scores.\n\n Multiple regression was used to assess predictors of changes in HRQOL.\n\n\nResults\nTwelve-month changes in HRQOL and psychosocial factors differed by intervention group.\n\n The combined diet + exercise group improved 4 aspects of HRQOL (physical functioning, role-physical, vitality, and mental health), and stress (p ? 0.01 vs.\n\n controls).\n\n The diet group increased vitality score (p &lt; 0.01 vs.\n\n control), while HRQOL did not change differently in the exercise group compared with controls.\n\n However, regardless of intervention group, weight loss predicted increased physical functioning, role-physical, vitality, and mental health, while increased aerobic fitness predicted improved physical functioning.\n\n Positive changes in depression, stress, and social support were independently associated with increased HRQOL, after adjusting for changes in weight and aerobic fitness.\n\n\nConclusions\nA combined diet and exercise intervention has positive effects on HRQOL and psychological health, which may be greater than that from exercise or diet alone.\n\n Improvements in weight, aerobic fitness and psychosocial factors may mediate intervention effects on HRQOL.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3215656","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

this effect of stress.\n Here we used a rodent model of PTSD in which rats repeatedly exposed to a stressor display heightened fear learning following auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning.\n Our results show that stress-related increases in circulating ghrelin, a peptide hormone, are necessary and sufficient for stress-associated vulnerability to exacerbated fear learning and these actions of

but did not increase either corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) or corticosterone.\n Repeated intra-amygdala infusion of a ghrelin receptor agonist produced a similar enhancement of fear memory.\n Ghrelin receptor antagonism during repeated stress abolished stress-related enhancement of fear memory without blunting stress-induced corticosterone release.\n We also examined links between ghrelin and growth hormone (GH), a major downstream effector of the ghrelin receptor.\n GH protein was upregulated in the amygdala following chronic stress, and its release from amygdala neurons was increased by ghrelin receptor stimulation.\n Virus-mediated overexpression of GH in the amygdala was also sufficient to increase fear.\n Finally, virus-mediated overexpression of a GH receptor antagonist was sufficient to block the fear enhancing effects of repeated ghrelin receptor stimulation.\n Thus, ghrelin requires GH in the amygdala to exert fear-enhancing effects.\n These results suggest that ghrelin mediates a novel branch of the stress response and highlight a previously unrecognized role for ghrelin and growth hormone in maladaptive changes following prolonged

Introduction\nThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a global experience that is unique in modern world history. Since it affects widely disparate areas of life on the social and individual levels, it is classified as an existential experience. The ongoing pandemic has enforced social isolation, which is strongly related to psychological distress and high anxiety and stress levels. There are particular social groups who are exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and vulnerable to deteriorated mental health. The most exposed groups are elderly people, medical personnel, and international migrant workers. Although young adults are the least exposed, they are the most vulnerable group with regard to the deterioration of mental health. It is worth noting that high stress and anxiety levels were observed in students before the pandemic as well. In addition, this group is considered to be at particular risk of high stress levels. Therefore, students are highly vulnerable with regard to the negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as high stress levels. Hence, perceived stress levels and mental health of students during the pandemic require monitoring and in-depth research.\nPerceived Stress and Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic\nPsychological stress emerges from an imbalance between an individual's perception and external demands. Perceived stress refers to the assessment of the degree to which the situation in one's life is seen as stressful; therefore, it is related to the subjective assessment of life events. It is related to assessing how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded individuals find their lives. Mental health is analyzed in this study through the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale and depression symptoms according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria. Based on those criteria, GAD is characterized by persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things. It relates to anxiety as a state. Depression is one of the most common yet treatable mental health disorders. It refers to a number of symptoms including depressed mood, loss of interest in most or all activities, loss of energy, or feeling of worthlessness. Perceived stress is strongly related to both anxiety and depression symptoms. The relationship between perceived stress and mental health is complex, and the direct cause-and-effect relationship is not clear.\nPublic mental health during COVID-19 deserves special attention; based on previous experiences, pandemic outbreaks are related to generalized fear that can impede infection control and lead to depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Previous health emergencies have shown psychological consequences of quarantine, such as high stress levels and depression, especially in younger women. Therefore, even though lockdown can decrease the spread of COVID-19, it can deteriorate mental health. A survey carried out during the self-isolation, lockdown, and social distancing periods revealed that female gender, younger age, lower annual income, smoking, and multiple physical morbidities were found to be correlated with a higher risk of mental health problems and lower satisfaction with life.\nA national study among Chinese people showed that 35% of participants experienced psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological distress was higher in women, people between 18 and 30 years or over 60 years of age, and those with higher education. Higher psychological distress in the younger population and women was noticed also in an Italian study (higher perceived stress, anxiety, and depression) and in other Chinese research (higher stress and anxiety). Research on a general Chinese population showed a prevalence of moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms of 16.5% and 28.8%, respectively. Among people who experienced self-isolation for 14 days, anxiety was positively correlated with stress. \nStudents are particularly vulnerable to mental health problems, as a study before the COVID-19 pandemic showed. Among variables related to mental health were older age and female sex, although the relationship was relatively modest. Therefore, it was assumed that mental health disorder symptoms were widely distributed in the general student population. The prevalence of depression and anxiety was 29% and 21%, respectively, among medical students. Among Turkish students, 43.5% presented moderate to high anxiety, 18.6% moderate to high depression, and 30.9% moderate to high stress levels.The prevalence of moderate and severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress was respectively 29.5%, 50.3%, and 39.9% among final-year Turkish students before the pandemic. Turkish female students had higher depression, anxiety, and stress levels compared to male students.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and education is expected to be highly noticeable. A comparison of students' mental health before and during the pandemic showed significant deterioration in aspects of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress, with female students being more vulnerable to decreased mental health compared to male students. Most of the students (71%) indicated increased perceived stress and anxiety due to the pandemic. Additionally, a Turkish study showed that students experienced higher levels of anxiety, depression, and perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period.\nThe prevalence of stress during the COVID-19 outbreak among first-year French students was 61.6%, while in Saudi Arabia 30.2% of students experienced high perceived stress, with more female students reporting high perceived stress levels than male students (34% vs. 19%). The prevalence of moderate and severe anxiety symptoms during the pandemic was nearly 4% in Chinese students, whereas in Polish university students it was 35%. Living in an urban area, having family income stability, and living with parents were related to lower anxiety, whereas having relatives or acquaintances infected with COVID-19 was related to higher anxiety. However, research among students in Bangladesh showed that living with parents and in an urban area was linked to higher depression and anxiety. This research also revealed different patterns of gender in mental health during the pandemic, as male students were characterized by higher depression and anxiety compared to female students.\nPhysical activity (PA) is strongly related to mental; therefore, it has been highly recommended during COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. During the pandemic, decreased PA intensity has been noted in countries of Asia, America, Africa, and Europe, although in some countries (such as Belgium and Canada) the intensity has increased. As research shows that PA plays an important role in decreasing stress levels, the intensity of PA during the pandemic should be monitored, particularly in groups vulnerable to mental health problems such as students. \nThere are several studies on mental health during the pandemic among Turkish, medical, nursing, and midwifery students, although less attention is given to non-medical students' mental health.\nConsidering the novelty of the coronavirus pandemic, it is still unclear how factors related to COVID-19 (perception of its impact on students' well-being), sociodemographic variables, physical activity, and mental health (anxiety and depression) are associated with perceived stress levels in students. Therefore, the aims of this study are to reveal the prevalence of mental health and perceived stress levels and to explore perceived stress predictors in Turkish university students. Considering previous research showing the role of sociodemographic variables such as place of residence and gender, year of study, physical activity, satisfaction with life, and mental health indicators such as anxiety and depression symptoms, we examined those variables as predictors of perceived stress among Turkish students during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2. Materials and Methods \n2.1. The Study\nA cross-sectional study was conducted online between 16 May and 10 June 2020. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Turkey was reported on 10 March 2020, and the first COVID-19-related death in the country was announced on 17 March. The number of daily coronavirus cases was 5000-5100 per day, reaching a peak between 11-21 April. From the beginning of June the number decreased to 1000-1500 cases per day and stayed stable until October 2020. After the number of infections increased, remote learning for the 2020 spring semester was introduced at universities. During the research period, particular measures were adopted by the government in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (closing schools and universities; enforcing social distancing; closing non-essential shops, restaurants, gyms, sport facilities, and theaters; and limiting traveling and socializing). \nThe survey was created by means of Google Forms. The invitation to the online study was sent to students by researchers via email and social media. For 95% of the sample, academics at three main universities sent invitations to students (Bingol University, 42%; Ataturk University, 43%; Mugla Sitki Kocman University, 10%). Within this sample across the three main universities, the invitation was send by academics to about 4500, 410, and 150 students, respectively. The remaining 5% of the sample was collected by both, academics and students, and the invitation was shared with 8000 students; nevertheless, only 19 students responded. \nThe survey was usually completed within 20 min. The study adhered to ethical requirements pertaining to the anonymity and voluntariness of participation. An informed consent question was added to the survey, and each participant consented to participate in the study. Initially, 361 persons responded to the invitation. However, ultimately, three respondents did not agree to participate in the study. \n2.2. The Sample\nSampling was purposive. The selection criterion was being a Turkish student. To assess the sample size, we used the sampling technique presented by. The calculation, based on a previous study (6.3% prevalence, type 1 error of 3%, and study power of 95%), showed that at least 252 individuals would need to be surveyed. Nevertheless, we included 358 Turkish university students due to a high number of variables and the possibility of within-group comparisons. \nThe study encompassed 358 students from 13 Turkish universities located in 10 cities: Bingol University, Bingol (n = 151, 42%); Ataturk University, Erzurum (n = 153, 43%); Mugla Sitki Kocman University, Mugla (n = 35, 10%); Baskent University, (n = 3, 0.8%), Beykoz University (n = 1, 0.3%), Bogazici University (n = 1, 0.3%), and Istanbul University (n = 1, 0.3%), Istanbul; Agri Ibrahim Cecen University, Agri (n = 5, 1.4%); Adnan Menderes University, Aydin (n = 1, 0.3%); Firat University, Elazig (n = 3, 0.8%); Akdeniz University, Antalya (n = 1, 0.3%); Dicle University, Diyarbakir (n = 1, 0.3%); and Kirikkale University, Kirikkale (n = 1, 0.3%). Predominantly, students represented the bachelor level of studies, and the most frequent fields of study represented were social sciences and health sciences. Nearly 70% of participants lived in a city.\nWomen constituted 56% of the sample (n = 200). The participants' age ranged from 19 to 40 years, and the average age was 23. Detailed descriptive statistics on gender, place of residence, level of study, field of study, year of study, and type of study are presented in Table 1.\n2.3. Measures\nTo measure whether the respondents' appraised the situation in their life as stressful, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) in the Turkish adaptation was employed. The PPS-10 consists of 10 items referring to the frequency of stressful events that occurred in the month preceding the study, which are assessed on a 5-point scale (0 = never to 4 = very often). The internal reliability of the Turkish version was adequate at 0.70. The Cronbach's alpha for this sample was 0.75.\nThe 7-item generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scale in the Turkish adaptation is a self-reported measure designed to screen for symptoms following Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria. People rate how often they experienced anxiety symptoms in the two weeks preceding the study on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = not at all, 1 = several days, 2 = more than half the days, and 3 = nearly every day). The ranges of GAD-7 scores are 0-4, minimal anxiety; 5-9, mild anxiety; 10-14, moderate anxiety; and 15-21, severe anxiety. Scores above 10 points indicate an anxiety disorder. In this study, the Cronbach's alpha for the GAD-7 equals 0.91.\nThe Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) was used to measure depression symptoms among Turkish students. The PHQ-8 consists of eight items, conforming with DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Participants use a Likert-type response scale ranging from 0 = not at all to 3 = nearly every day. The ranges of PHQ-8 scores are 0-4, normal; 5-9, mild major depressive disorder; 10-14, moderate; 15-19, moderately severe; and 20-24, severe. A cut-off score of 10 or above is recommended to screen for major depressive disorder. The Turkish language version was derived from the Multicultural Mental Health Resource Centre. The internal consistency reliability of the original version measured by Cronbach's alpha equals 0.86, and in this study it was 0.89.\n2.4. Pandemic-Related Measurements\nPerception of COVID-19 impact (PCI) on well-being was measured using five statements rated on a 5-item Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = definitely agree). PCI measures how much students are afraid that the current situation related to the coronavirus pandemic may negatively affect their life in each of the following areas: (1) completion of the semester and graduation; (2) job search and professional development; (3) financial situation (e.g., subsistence during studies); (4) relationships with loved ones and family; and (5) relationships with colleagues and friends. Next, scores obtained from the five items were summarized. Higher scores indicated more significant coronavirus-related concerns. Internal reliability of the scale was appropriate with Cronbach's alpha = 0.72.\nExposure to COVID-19 was measured by eight questions concerning pandemic consequences related to (1) experiencing COVID-19 symptoms; (2) being tested for COVID-19; (3) being hospitalized due to COVID-19; (4) being in a strict 14-day quarantine; (5) COVID-19 infection in family, friends, or relatives; (6) death in the family; (7) losing a job; and (8) declining economic status.\nPhysical activity (PA) during the coronavirus-related lockdown was assessed using the following question (Q1): &quot;How many days a week did you practice physical exercises or pursue sports activities at home or away from home, at the university, in a club, or at the gym in the previous month?&quot; Participants answered this question on an 8-point scale (0 = not one day to 7 = seven days a week). The subsequent question (Q2) was: &quot;How many minutes a day (on average) did you practice?&quot; Respondents completed the question by stating an average number of minutes of PA per day. The following question (Q3), answered on an analogous 8-point scale to Q1, was: &quot;How many days a week did you do physical exercise or pursue sports activities at home or away from home, at the university, in a club, or at the gym within a month before the general coronavirus quarantine?&quot; The last question (Q4) was: &quot;How many minutes a day (on average) did you practice?&quot; The number of days was multiplied by the number of minutes per day to calculate the PA level during the pandemic (Q1,2) and before the pandemic (Q3,4). \nPA level was divided into two groups: inactive (less than 150 min weekly) and active (150 or more minutes weekly) in relation to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. \n3. Results\nThe study used SPSS.25 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) software. The analysis encompassed Pearson's r coefficient correlations, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate significance of differences, and hierarchical multiple linear regression. In addition, descriptive statistics of the surveyed variables were presented. Although the analysis did not prove a normal distribution of variables (p &lt; 0.05), a further analysis of distribution based on skewness and kurtosis coefficients indicated sufficient symmetry and similarity to the Gaussian curve since the absolute values of the obtained coefficients did not exceed 1, which indicates good psychometric properties. It is noteworthy that ANOVA is considered a robust test against the normality assumption and tolerates violations to its normality assumption well.\n3.1. Descriptive Statistics\nThe analysis of descriptive statistics showed that perceived stress was high, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was mild, and depression symptoms (PHQ) were moderate, while satisfaction with life among Turkish students during the pandemic was low. Even though average anxiety in the sample was mild, over half of the students presented symptoms according to the GAD (52%) and PHQ (62%). One-third of students met neither depression nor anxiety diagnostic criteria, whereas nearly half were characterized by a dual diagnosis (45%). Almost every fifth university student (23%) met the criteria for at least one diagnosis (anxiety or depression).\nPerception of the negative impact of COVID-19 on students' well-being was the most pronounced regarding their financial situation, job search, and completion of the semester. The least negative impact was perceived in the area of relationships with loved ones, family, and friends. When analyzing results for the perception of the impact of COVID-19 on well-being as a five-item scale, it can be noted that the grand mean was 3.75. It can be interpreted that, in general, students perceived the impact of the pandemic as negative. Before the pandemic, students were physically active for 189 min weekly, and during the pandemic for 75 min weekly. Table 2 outlines the descriptive statistics of the surveyed variables for all scales as sums of the points of all items. \nReferring to the variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentages of physical activity (PA) before and during the pandemic and exposure to the virus were analyzed. Before the pandemic, 38% of students were physically active and met the WHO criterion (over 150 min per week), while during the pandemic only 13% remained active. The effect of exposure to COVID-19 was the strongest in the aspect of declining economic status (65%) and experiencing job loss (by a student or in the student's family; 47%). Although 6% of students experienced symptoms of coronavirus infection, only one student was hospitalized. Of the 12% of students tested for COVID-19, 5% were in a strict 14-day quarantine. Every fifth student (22%) experienced COVID-19 infection among close relatives. There were 19 cases of coronavirus-related deaths among students' families.\nReferring to psychological variables, only 13% of students were characterized by a normal level of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), whereas over half of them (52%) presented clinical symptoms of GAD. Low satisfaction with life was perceived by 56% of students, and high satisfaction by only 19%. A majority of students (71%) reported high levels of perceived stress, while only 6% reported low levels. The results are presented in Table 3. \n3.2. Correlations\nPearson's r coefficient was applied in order to verify correlations among variables (Table 4). The correlations between perceived stress and other variables turned out to be significant. The effect size of the correlation between perceived stress (PSS) and the perception of COVID-19 impact (PCI) on students' well-being was positive and small, whereas for PSS and satisfaction with life it was negative and small. The correlation between PSS and generalized anxiety disorder intensity can be described as positive and large. PCI was negatively correlated with satisfaction with life and positively with GAD. Both effect sizes were small. Satisfaction with life was inversely correlated with GAD. The effect size was also small. \n3.3. Significance of Differences\nOne-way ANOVA was introduced to assess the significance of differences in perceived stress in relation to gender, place of residence, year of study, and physical activity (PA) during the pandemic. Place of residence and year of study turned out to be insignificant (p &gt; 0.005), whereas gender and PA were significant. For statistical purposes, six participants who did not want to describe themselves as male or female were excluded from the analysis. Gender turned out to significantly diversify PSS: F(1350) = 15.79, p &lt; 0.001. Female students were characterized by significantly higher PSS levels (M = 23.88, SD = 6.56) compared to male students (M = 21.26, SD = 5.48), although the effect size was small; Cohen's d = 0.43. PA significantly diversified PSS: F(1356) = 4.04, p = 0.045. Inactive students had significantly higher PSS levels (M = 23.16, SD = 6.32) compared to active students (M = 20.00, SD = 5.16). The effect size was medium; Cohen's d = 0.55.\n3.4. Hierarchical Multiple Linear Regression\nIn order to develop a model for predicting perceived stress levels among students during the COVID-19 pandemic, a hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was conducted. The dependent variables introduced into the regression model were the following: gender, physical activity during the pandemic, perception of negative impact of COVID-19 on well-being, satisfaction with life, and anxiety. The introduced variables were significantly diversified and correlated with perceived stress. Nevertheless, place of residence and year of study turned out to be insignificant for perceived stress differentiation and were therefore excluded from the regression model. An examination of correlations (see Table 4) revealed that no independent variables were highly correlated, with the exception of PSS and GAD-7. However, as the collinearity statistics (tolerance and variance inflation factor VIF) were within accepted limits, the assumption of multicollinearity was deemed to have been met.\nFor the first block analysis, the predictor variable gender was analyzed. The results of the hierarchical analysis of model 1 turned out to be statistically significant: F(1350) = 15.79, p &lt; 0.001. Being a female student was a predictor of perceived stress and explained only 4% of the variance. For the second block analysis, the predictor variable physical activity during COVID-19 was introduced. Model 2 turned out to be significant (F(2349) = 13.85, p &lt; 0.001). Being a physically inactive female student explained 7% of the variance. The perception of a negative impact of COVID-19 on students' well-being was introduced to model 3. The additional variable positively predicted PSS. Model 3 was statistically significant (F(3348) = 13.28, p &lt; 0.001) and explained 9% of the variance. Psychological variables satisfaction with life and generalized anxiety disorder were introduced as predictors to model 4, which also turned out to be significant (F(5346) = 33.81, p &lt; 0.001) and explained 32% of the variance. Nevertheless, only two predictors remained statistically significant; high generalized anxiety disorder and being physically inactive during the pandemic explained 32% of the variance. Therefore, after controlling for gender and the perception of a negative impact of COVID-19, mostly generalized anxiety disorder, along with physical inactivity, predicted high perceived stress. The results are shown in detail in Table 5. \n4. Discussion\nOur study evidenced that students reported high perceived stress, mild generalized anxiety, and low satisfaction with life. More than half of the students met the diagnostic criteria of generalized anxiety disorder (52%) and depression (63%). Female and physically inactive students had higher perceived stress levels. A hierarchical linear regression model showed that after controlling for gender and negative COVID-19 impact on well-being, anxiety and physical inactivity significantly predicted high perceived stress. The study shows that students' mental health during the pandemic is at high risk. \n4.1. Prevalence of Perceived Stress and Mental Health \nIn this study, students were characterized in general by high perceived stress, mild anxiety, and moderate depression, with 5.6% reporting low perceived stress, 23% medium, and 71.2% high. The results differed among Indian students, i.e., 4%, 82.7%, and 13.3%, respectively; by comparison, a greater number of Turkish students had higher stress levels. This was similar to results for Polish and Saudi Arabian students. Furthermore, stress levels among Turkish students compared with Swiss students, who experienced an increase in perceived stress from low to medium due to the pandemic, were significantly higher. The differences in stress levels can be explained by financial concerns and insufficient financial support in Turkey. It is worth noting that students' satisfaction with life in Turkey was low. This also draws attention to socioeconomic status as an important predictor of psychological functioning in highly stressful situations such as a pandemic. Moreover, in the Chinese population, satisfaction with life was low before and during the pandemic, and decreased during the pandemic.\nCompared to stress levels of Turkish students before the pandemic, current research shows significantly higher levels, with 39.9% of students and 63% of medical students reporting medium and high levels pre-pandemic and 94.4% during the pandemic in our research. The stress level among Turkish nursing students surveyed in April-May 2020 was moderated and therefore different from the high level among students in our study in May-June 2020. The increased stress level in Turkish students is in agreement with other research.\nTurkish students had mild anxiety and moderate depression symptoms. Among those with anxiety, 35.7% reported mild symptoms, 28.8% moderate, and 22.9% severe; 12.6% of students had no anxiety symptoms. Among those with depression, 27.7% reported mild symptoms, 24% moderate, 23.7% moderately severe, and 15.1% severe symptoms; 9.5% of students had no depression symptoms. Depression symptoms were more frequent than anxiety symptoms (62.8% vs. 51.6%). One-third of students (31%) did not meet any diagnostic criteria for anxiety or depression, but almost half (45.5%) had a dual diagnosis. Therefore, the prevalence of comorbid depression encompasses a large number of Turkish university students, although there were more students with severe anxiety (23%) than severe depression (15%). \nPrevious research evidenced higher anxiety in students during the pandemic, although similar to our sample, at a mild level. Nevertheless, the number of students reporting diagnostic symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder was high (51.6%). On the one hand, such high levels of anxiety in students are in agreement with research showing higher anxiety rates compared to the general population. On the other hand, such levels highly exceed the prevalence of anxiety assessed by the same measurement (GAD-7) in Chinese (4% and 28%), Polish (35%), and Bangladeshi (42.9%) students, but were slightly lower compared to Israeli nursing students (56%). Compared to the Italian general population, the prevalence of severe anxiety symptoms in Turkish students was slightly higher, at 22.91%, compared to 20.8%.\nDepression levels were moderate in Turkish students, whereas severe depression symptoms were reported by 15%, which is in agreement with a Chinese student sample (16%). On the other hand, in Wuhan (China), depression symptoms characterized almost half of the student sample (48%). The prevalence of depression symptoms in this research (62.8%) was higher than that in the Bangladeshi student sample (53.4%). The prevalence of moderately severe to severe depression symptoms in Turkish students was twice as high (38.8%) when compared to the general population (17.3%).\nThese differences might be due to the different measurement periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, although high anxiety and depression are related to the pandemic in general, cross-cultural differences should be taken into account when explaining perceived stress in student populations. On the other hand, the results are in agreement with other research revealing higher stress, anxiety, and depression in students compared to the general population.\n4.2. Exposure to COVID-19 \nDirect exposure to COVID-19 was relatively low among Turkish students in terms of hospitalization (only one student was hospitalized). At the same time, every fifth student experienced COVID-19 infection among family or friends, and 5.3% experienced the death of close relatives. By the end of data collection (10 June) there were 4747 deaths due to COVID-19, and while the curve of new cases was decreasing, the number of total deaths was rising. Therefore, it would seem that the student sample was overexposed to the bereavement experience. Nevertheless, there were concerns regarding the openness and clarity of COVID-19 data in Turkey, as it seemed that the prevalence of the disease (particularly total deaths) might be underreported by governments of other countries.\nTurkish students were most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the financial aspect. Among the students, 65% noted a deterioration of their economic status, and half of them experienced losing a job (themselves or among family members). This means that the coronavirus pandemic affects healthy people mostly by way of economic consequences. The beginning of the pandemic brought high uncertainty among students regarding academic life (mode of study, completion of studies, or graduation).\nEven though such problems were related to the abrupt introduction of remote learning and the uncertainty arising at universities seemed to be the strongest source of stress in students, it turned out that financial issues had a stronger impact. In our study, undergraduates perceived a medium negative impact of the pandemic on their university achievements, but a high impact on their financial situation. Therefore, based on our research, the consequences of this unique worldwide situation for students should be labeled as a financial pandemic. \n4.3. Exploring Perceived Stress: The Role of Gender, Physical Activity, Perception of COVID-19, Satisfaction with Life, and Anxiety \nWe have shown that perceived stress relates positively with a negative perception of COVID-19 impact (PCI) on students' well-being in the areas of education, economy, and relationships. Perceived stress was strongly linked to generalized anxiety disorder and negatively with satisfaction with life. Place of residence and year of study turned out to be insignificant for stress level differentiation. Previous research showed an inconsistent but significant association between living in a rural or urban area and mental health but not perceived stress. Our research shows that place of residence was not associated with perceived stress during the pandemic. We also expected that the year of study, as related to age, would be important for perceived stress, but our hypothesis failed. \nOur findings confirm the importance of physical activity for decreasing perceived stress levels. The students' physical activity dropped compared to the period before the pandemic, which is also consistent with other studies. There was a 25% decrease in physical activity (&lt;=150 min weekly). Inactive students had also significantly higher perceived stress levels compared to active students, and the effect size was medium.\nThe study revealed significant differences in stress levels due to gender. In relation to other studies, female students reported significantly higher stress levels compared to male students, but the effect size was small. \nWe have shown that being female, being physically inactive, and having a negative perception of the impact of COVID-19 on students' well-being are significant predictors of perceived stress in students. However, after introducing satisfaction with life and anxiety to the model, gender turned out to be an insignificant predictor. Additionally, satisfaction with life turned out to be insignificant with regard to stress levels during the pandemic. It might be due to the fact that the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) is a generalized cognitive assessment of subjective well-being that is quite stable throughout the course of life. Therefore, as perceived stress was elevated due to the recent experience of the pandemic (as compared to the pre-pandemic period), SWLS could not predict its levels, due to high stability over time. Finally, 32% of the variance was explained by physical inactivity, and high anxiety was the strongest predictor. Hence, high anxiety and physical inactivity are better predictors of perceived stress than gender, even though gender diversifies stress levels. \nThe perception of the COVID-19 impact (PCI) on students' well-being turned out to be a significant predictor of perceived stress in the model of regression together with gender and physical activity. In this model (without anxiety and satisfaction with life), negative PCI, female gender, and physical inactivity predicted high stress levels in students. The PCI components were related to problems with graduation and completion of the semester, job search, financial situation, and concerns about relationships with family and friends. Therefore, unless anxiety is disregarded, a negative perception of the impact of COVID-19 in those areas of students' lives strongly predicts higher stress levels.\nThe pandemic situation affects students' well-being, as the results of a negative PCI (including concerns about academic future and completing the semester) show. Considering a strong relationship between perceived stress, mental health, and problems with academic life with burnout syndrome, we want to shed light on possible outcomes of high stress levels that could lead to academic burnout in the future.\n4.4. Future Research\nFuture research should focus on comparing student populations to other young adults and adults. The second stage of this study will be carried out in October-November 2020 to determine the longitudinal effects of COVID-19 on mental health and well-being. As most of the pandemic research relates to negative consequences, an analysis of positive outcomes will be introduced in the second wave of the study. \n4.5. Limitations\nThere are several limitations to this study. One is its cross-sectional character. A longitudinal study design would have enabled establishing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perceived stress and the direct cause-and-effect relationship between examined variables and perceived stress. Also, the lack of random sampling and the representation of a student population limited to eastern Turkey seem to be a burden in generalizing the results. Using globally validated standardized tools allowed for discussion with regard to perceived stress and mental health. Nevertheless, the discussion and literature review showed great differences in student populations between countries, and an international study design could help to explain those differences and understand students' perceived stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we did not control the number of students with a previous clinical diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. Controlling this variable could prove the effect of COVID-19 on anxiety and perceived stress, so as to fully reflect the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms among students.\nThe biggest limitation to this study is very low response rate (2.7%). The response rates were 3.4% (151/4500) at Bingol University, 37.3% (153/410) at Ataturk University, 23.3% (35/150) at Mugla Sitki Kocman University, and 0.2% (19/8000) at all other 10 universities. The highest response rate at Ataturk University could be due to the form of dissemination of the invitation to the study participation. It was spread directly via the university's online platform, i.e., a highly formal manner. That could cause a strong feeling of obligation to fulfill the survey by students. The lower response rate in other cases could be due to the use of many communication procedures (i.e., social media) such that they could have missed the survey or were not willing to fill it out. Nevertheless, research with low response rates may generate prevalence estimates that are biased by selective non-response; therefore, the results of our study should be interpreted with caution.\n5. Conclusions\nThe state of perceived stress, mental health, and well-being among Turkish students is alarming and requires systemic and dedicated action. Universities together with authorities should collaborate to create an efficient system, of both psychological and financial help for students. Considering the high number of students experiencing a deterioration of economic status, special programs dedicated to financial support during the pandemic should emerge, i.e., scholarships or student loans. Also, fighting an infodemic (an overabundance of information) and misinformation during the pandemic can help to improve the mental health of students.\nTo decrease stress levels, online psychological counseling services should be provided. Even though female students presented higher anxiety and stress levels, decreasing anxiety levels and boosting physical activity for all students seem critical. Providing mental health support systems for students and promoting physical activity on a regular basis could decrease perceived stress levels. \nPublisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization, I.A. and D.O.; methodology, D.O.; software, D.O.; validation, I.A. and D.O.; formal Analysis, I.A. and D.O.; investigation, D.O.; resources, I.A., D.O., and O.C.; data curation, I.A. and O.C.; writing:original draft preparation, I.A. and D.O.; writing:review and editing, I.A., D.O., and O.C.; visualization, D.O.; supervision, I.A. and D.O.; project administration, I.A. and D.O.; funding acquisition.

QoL were collected via online surveys from 2289 adults (mean age = 27.8 ± 12 years) who had been isolated at home for an average of 77 days.\n Results: More than 50% of the respondents reported that

Results: Participants reported moderatehigh levels of PA correlates and QoL as the means ranged from 5.5 to 6 (out of 7) for PA correlates and 2.75 to 4 (out of 4) for QoL.\n The minute-by-minute stepping rate revealed participants had average 580.51 min/day in sedentary, 134.77 min/day in LPA, and 1.57 min/day in MVPA.\n Regression analyses for physical function, stress, depression, and social issues suggested that the models explained 4%8% of the variances.\n Specifically, perceived competence was the negative predictor of the problems with physical function (? = ?0.17, p &lt; 0.05) and depression (? = ?0.18, p &lt; 0.01), amotivation was positively associated with depression and stress (p &lt; 0.05).\n Additionally, controlled motivation predicted the ability to participate in social roles and activities (? = 0.22, p &lt; 0.05).\n No significant predictors emerged for fatigue or for sleep.\n Conclusions: Findings suggest Chinese college students perceived

syndrome (MetS) independent of sleep duration and vice versa, and 3) sedentary time and sleep duration have an interactive effect on the MetS.\n\n\nMethods\nThis cross-sectional study is based on the 20032006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\n\n A sample of 1371 adults (aged ?20 years) were studied.\n\n Average daily sedentary time and sleep duration were determined via 7-day accelerometry.\n\n Screen time was determined via questionnaire.\n\n The MetS was determined using standard criteria.\n\n Analysis of variance was used to examine relationships among sedentary time and screen time with sleep duration.\n\n Logistic regression was used to examine associations between sedentary time, screen time, and sleep duration with the MetS after controlling for several confounders.\n\n\nResults\nSedentary time and screen time did not vary across sleep duration quartiles.\n\n Participants in the highest quartile of sedentary time were more likely to have the MetS than participants in the lowest quartile (odds ratio?=?1.60, 95% CI:1.05-2.45).\n\n The odds of the MetS was higher in participants in the highest screen time tertile as compared to the lowest tertile

of sleep as a contributor to obesity in adolescents: impacts on eating and activity behaviors","abstract":"Background\nSleep is an important contributor to physical and mental health; however, chronic sleep deprivation has become common in adolescents, especially on weekdays.\n\n Adolescents aged 1417 years are recommended to sleep between 8 and 10 h per night to maximize overall health and well-being.\n\n Although sleep needs may vary between individuals, sleep duration recommendations are important for surveillance and help inform policies, interventions, and the population of healthy sleep behaviors.\n\n Long sleepers are very rare among teenagers and sleeping too much is not a problem per se; only insufficient sleep is associated with adverse health outcomes in the pediatric population.\n\n Causes of insufficient sleep are numerous and chronic sleep deprivation poses a serious threat to the academic success, health and safety of adolescents.\n\n This article focuses on the link between insufficient sleep and obesity in adolescents.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis call to action article argues that sleep should be taken more seriously by the public health community and by our society in general, i.\n\ne.\n\n, given as much attention and resources as nutrition and physical activity.\n\n Not only that having a good nights sleep is as important as eating a healthy diet and being regularly physically active for overall health, but sleeping habits also impact eating and screen time behaviors and, therefore, can influence body weight control.\n\n\nSummary\nShort sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and late bedtimes are all associated with excess food intake, poor diet quality, and obesity in adolescents.\n\n Sleep, sedentary behavior, physical activity and diet all interact and influence each other to ultimately impact health.\n\n A holistic approach to health (i.\n\ne.\n\n, the whole day matters) targeting all of these behaviors synergistically is needed to optimize the impact of our interventions.\n\n Sleep is not a waste of time and sleep hygiene is an important factor to consider in the prevention and treatment of obesity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5037605","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

of cardiovascular disease in adults","abstract":"Numerous health behaviors, including physical activity, diet, smoking, and sleep, play a major role in preventing the development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n Among these behaviors, sleep may play a pivotal role, yet it has been studied somewhat less than other behaviors and there have been few well-designed sleep intervention studies targeting CVD.\n Furthermore, despite the fact that these behaviors are often interrelated, interventions tend to focus on changing one health behavior rather than concurrently intervening on multiple behaviors.\n Psychological constructs from depression to positive affect may also have a major effect on these health behaviors and ultimately on CVD.\n In this review, we summarize the existing literature on the impact of sleep and other cardiac health behaviors on CVD onset and prognosis.\n We also describe interventions that may promote these behaviors, from established interventions such as motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy, to more novel approaches focused on mindfulness and other positive psychological constructs.\n Finally, we outline population-health-level care management approaches for patients with psychiatric conditions (e.\ng.\n, depression) that may impact cardiac health, and discuss their potential utility in improving mental health, promoting health behaviors, and reducing CVD-related risk.\n Much work is still needed to better understand how sleep and other health behaviors may uniquely contribute to CVD risk, and additional high-quality studies of interventions designed to modify cardiac health behaviors are required to improve cardiovascular health in individuals and the population at

physical activity measuring device, doubly labeled water, or an objective fitness measure were included.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-three validation studies were included in this review.\n\n There was a great deal of variability in the methods used across studies, but the results were largely similar.\n\n Correlations between the total physical activity level measured by the IPAQ-SF and objective

especially the short texts on Social Network Services (SNS) brings new demands of computerized text analysis instruments.\n The psychometric properties are the basis of the extensive use of these instruments such as the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC).\n For this study, Sina Weibo statuses were analyzed via rater coding and Simplified Chinese version of LIWC (SCLIWC), in order to evaluate the validity of SCLIWC in detecting psychological expressions in Weibo statuses (n = 60) and in identifying the psychological meaning of a single Weibo status (n = 11).\n Significant correlations between human ratings and SCLIWC scores and the high sensitivities of capturing single statuses with certain expressions identified by raters, proved the validity of SCLIWC in detecting psychological expressions.\n The results also suggested that, the efficiency of SCLIWC in detecting psychological expressions of SNS short texts could be higher if using status count scoring method, rather than the word count method as the common usage of LIWC.\n However, SCLIWC may not perform well in identifying the psychological meaning of a single piece of SNS short text because of its over-identification of target expressions.\n This study provided primary evidence of validity of SCLIWC, as well as the proper way of using it efficiently on SNS short

Second, are these behavior and mental health changes associated with the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media?\nMethods\nBehaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife smartphone sensing app.\n\n Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students, with 178 (82.0%) students providing data during the Winter 2020 term.\n\n Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term compared to previous terms in the same cohort were modeled using mixed linear models.\n\n\nResults\nDuring the first academic term impacted by COVID-19 (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P&lt;.\n\n001) relative to previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks.\n\n Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and the week of the academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant.\n\n In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term were strongly associated with increased amount of COVID-19related news.\n\n When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P&lt;.\n\n001) and depression (P=.\n\n03) were significantly associated with COVID-19related news.\n\n\nConclusions\nCompared with prior academic terms, individuals in the Winter 2020 term were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed.\n\n A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, were associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting.\n\n While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods to reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7301687","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR

series.\n\n\nSetting\nTongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nParticipants\nAmong a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed.\n\n Data were collected until 28 February 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)).\n\n The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days.\n\n Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively.\n\n Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\n\n Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%).\n\n Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications.\n\n Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk.\n\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis,

such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract, causing a more severe disease (e.\ng.\n, pneumonia).\n Respiratory viruses can also exacerbate asthma and lead to various types of respiratory distress syndromes.\n Furthermore, as they can adapt fast and cross the species barrier, some of these pathogens, like influenza A and SARS-CoV, have occasionally caused epidemics or pandemics, and were associated with more serious clinical diseases and even mortality.\n For a few decades now, data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that several respiratory viruses have neuroinvasive capacities, since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS).\n Viruses infecting human CNS cells could then cause different types of encephalopathy, including encephalitis, and long-term neurological diseases.\n Like other well-recognized neuroinvasive human viruses, respiratory viruses may damage the CNS as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals (virus-induced neuro-immunopathology) and/or viral replication, which directly causes damage to CNS cells (virus-induced neuropathology).\n The etiological agent of several neurological disorders remains unidentified.\n Opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of these disorders whose etiology remains poorly understood.\n Herein, we present a global portrait of some of the most prevalent or emerging human respiratory viruses that have been associated with possible pathogenic processes in CNS infection, with a special emphasis on human

leukocytes could participate in respiratory pathologies and serve as vector for viral spread towards other tissues, the susceptibility of human leukocytic cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infection was investigated.\n Human primary monocytes/macrophages were susceptible to HCoV-229E infection, but strongly restricted HCoV-OC43 replication.\n Moreover, productive HCoV-229E infection of primary monocytes and of the THP-1 monocytic cell line led to their activation, as indicated by the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-?, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL11 and MMP-9. Moreover, an in vitro chemotaxis assay showed that motility towards chemokines of THP-1 cells and primary monocytes was increased following an acute or persistent HCoV-229E infection.\n Taken together, these results suggest that infected monocytes could serve as a reservoir for HCoV-229E, become activated, participate in the exacerbation of pulmonary pathologies, as well as serve as potential vectors for viral dissemination to host tissues, where it could be associated with other pathologies.\n","id":"PMC7114174","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

and Influenza at the Centenary of the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza Pandemic: Mechanisms of Psychosis Risk","abstract":"Associations between influenza infection and psychosis have been reported since the eighteenth century, with acute psychoses of influenza documented during multiple pandemics.\n In the late 20th century, reports of a season-of-birth effect in schizophrenia were supported by large-scale ecological and sero-epidemiological studies suggesting that maternal influenza infection increases the risk of psychosis in offspring.\n We examine the evidence for the association between influenza infection and schizophrenia risk, before reviewing possible mechanisms via which this risk may be conferred.\n Maternal immune activation models implicate placental dysfunction, disruption of cytokine networks, and subsequent microglial activation as potentially important pathogenic processes.\n More recent neuroimmunological advances focusing on neuronal autoimmunity following

existence since the last century.\n\n Nevertheless, systematic studies on the association between these viruses and mood disorders are lacking.\n\n\nMethods\nInfluenza A, B and coronavirus antibody titers were measured in 257 subjects with recurrent unipolar and bipolar disorder and healthy controls, by SCID.\n\n Pearson's ?² tests and logistic regression models were used to analyze associations between seropositivity for coronaviruses, influenza A and B viruses and the following: a) history of recurrent mood disorders b) having attempted suicide in the past c) uni- vs.\n\n bi-polarity and d) presence of psychotic symptoms during mood episodes.\n\n\nResults\nSeropositivity for influenza A (p = 0.004), B (p &lt; 0.0001) and coronaviruses (p &lt; 0.0001) were associated with history of mood

Human coronaviruses cause respiratory infections that range in seriousness from common colds to severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n Like influenza, coronaviruses can be neurotropic.\n To test for associations between coronaviruses and serious mental disorders, we utilized a recently developed assay and measured immunoglobulin G (IgG) response against 4 human coronavirus strains (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43) in 106 patients with a recent onset of psychotic symptoms and 196 nonpsychiatric controls.\n We expressed results quantitatively as antibody levels and qualitatively as seroprevalence relative to a defined seropositivity cutoff value.\n Patient IgG levels were higher than controls for HKU1, NL63, and OC43, with HKU1 and NL63 both showing highly significant patient-to-control differences (HKU1, P ? .\n002; NL63, P ? .\n00001).\n All 4 coronaviruses were more seroprevalent in patients vs controls, with greatest intergroup differences observed for HKU1 (93% vs 77%, P ? .\n0001).\n HKU1 and NL63 associations with the patient group were further supported by multivariate analyses that controlled for age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, and smoking status (HKU1, odds ratio [OR] = 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.031.67, P ? .\n027; NL63, OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.254.66, P ? .\n008).\n Among patients, NL63 was associated with schizophrenia-spectrum (OR = 3.10, 95% CI = 1.277.58, P ? .\n013) but not mood disorders.\n HKU1 and NL63 coronavirus exposures may represent comorbid risk factors in neuropsychiatric disease.\n Future studies should explore

included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]).\n Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients.\n All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]).\n In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]).\n It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines.\n Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d?dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C?reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase.\n This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID?19 patients.\n Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia.\n Further

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 2324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·472·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·87·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227805), 113 (57193), 98 (49168), 111 (56191), and 80 (40139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 12 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"  .

We analyze change on multiple dimensions of social networks (interaction, friendship, social support, co-studying) and mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness) within two cohorts of Swiss undergraduate students experiencing the crisis (N = 212), and make additional comparisons to an earlier cohort which did not experience the crisis (N = 54).\n In within-person comparisons we find that interaction and co-studying networks had become sparser, and more students were studying alone.\n Furthermore, students levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms got worse, compared to measures before the crisis.\n Stressors shifted from fears of missing out on social life to worries about health, family, friends, and their future.\n Exploratory analyses suggest that COVID-19 specific worries, isolation in social networks, lack of interaction and emotional support, and physical isolation were associated with negative mental health trajectories.\n Female students appeared to have worse mental health trajectories when controlling for different levels of social integration and COVID-19 related stressors.\n As universities and researchers discuss future strategies on how to combine on-site teaching with online courses, our results indicate the importance of considering social contacts in students mental health and offer starting points to identify and support students at higher risk of social isolation and negative psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n","id":"PMC7377438","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

health problems in medical students has continuously increased and is higher than the prevalence of mental health problems in students with other majors, which could lead to undesirable consequences for the students and their future patients.\n\n In China, the current states of medical education and healthcare workplaces differ in certain areas from those in Western or other Asian countries.\n\n However, the mental health status of Chinese medical students has not been systematically analyzed.\n\n\nObjectives:\nThe purpose of this meta-analysis was to summarize the prevalence of mental health problems in Chinese medical students.\n\n\nMethods:\nAll cross-sectional studies that investigated the prevalence of any mental health problem among Chinese medical students were retrieved from the following databases: EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, OVID, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.\n\n We accepted each individual trial's inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants.\n\n The National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies was adopted to appraise the methodological quality of each study.\n\n RevMan (version 5.3) was used to analyze the data.\n\n\nResults:\nTen cross-sectional studies involving a total of 30,817 Chinese medical students were included.\n\n The prevalence of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and eating disorders were 29%, 21%, 11%, and 2%, respectively.\n\n Subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences in the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation between genders and no significant difference in the prevalence of depression between individuals of different ages (20 years and older or younger than 20 years).\n\n\nConclusions and implications of key findings:\nChinese medical students have relatively high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation but a low prevalence of eating disorders.\n\n Mental health problems in Chinese medical students should be taken seriously, and timely screening of and proper intervention in these mental health problems are highly recommended.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6504335","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wolters Kluwer

Virus Disease Outbreak","abstract":"id='Par1'>The 20132016 West Africa Ebola virus disease pandemic was the largest, longest, deadliest, and most geographically expansive outbreak in the 40-year interval since Ebola was first identified.\n Fear-related behaviors played an important role in shaping the outbreak.\n Fear-related behaviors are defined as individual or collective behaviors and actions initiated in response to fear reactions that are triggered by a perceived threat or actual exposure to a potentially traumatizing event.\n FRBs modify the future risk of harm.\n This review examines how fear-related behaviors were implicated in (1) accelerating the spread of Ebola, (2) impeding the utilization of life-saving Ebola treatment, (3) curtailing the availability of medical services for treatable conditions, (4) increasing the risks for new-onset psychological distress and psychiatric disorders, and (5) amplifying the downstream cascades of social problems.\n Fear-related behaviors are identified for each of these outcomes.\n Particularly notable are behaviors such as treating Ebola patients in home or private clinic settings, the laying of hands on Ebola-infected individuals to perform faith-based healing, observing hands-on funeral and burial customs, foregoing available life-saving treatment, and stigmatizing Ebola survivors and health professionals.\n Future directions include modeling the onset, operation, and perpetuation of fear-related behaviors and devising strategies to redirect behavioral responses to mass threats in a manner that reduces risks and promotes resilience.\n","id":"PMC5241909","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer US","authors":[{"firstname":"James

psychiatric complications among SARS survivors treated in the United Christian Hospital 30 months after the SARS outbreak.\n\n Psychiatric morbidities were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Impact of Events ScaleRevised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n\n Functional outcomes were assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey.\n\n\nResults\nNinety subjects were recruited, yielding a response rate of 96.8%.\n\n Post-SARS cumulative incidence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was 58.9%.\n\n Current prevalence for any

Data from Australia's first outbreak of equine influenza","abstract":"Background\nIn 2007 Australia experienced its first outbreak of highly infectious equine influenza.\n\n Government disease control measures were put in place to control, contain, and eradicate the disease; these measures included movement restrictions and quarantining of properties.\n\n This study was conducted to assess the psycho-social impacts of this disease, and this paper reports the prevalence of, and factors influencing, psychological distress during this outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nData were collected using an online survey, with a link directed to the affected population via a number of industry groups.\n\n Psychological distress, as determined by the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale, was the main outcome measure.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 2760 people participated in this study.\n\n Extremely high levels of non-specific psychological distress were reported by respondents in this study, with 34% reporting high psychological distress (K10 &gt; 22), compared to levels of around 12% in the Australian general population.\n\n Analysis, using backward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis, revealed that those living in high risk infection (red) zones (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.572.55; p &lt; 0.001) and disease buffer (amber) zones (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.362.46; p &lt; 0.001) were at much greater risk of high psychological distress than those living in uninfected (white zones).\n\n Although prevalence of high psychological distress was greater in infected EI zones and States, elevated levels of psychological distress were experienced in horse-owners nationally.\n\n Statistical analysis indicated that certain groups were more vulnerable to high psychological distress; specifically younger people, and those with lower levels of formal educational qualifications.\n\n Respondents whose principal source of income was from horse-related industry were more than twice as likely to have high psychological distress than those whose primary source of income was not linked to horse-related industry (OR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.822.73; p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nAlthough, methodologically, this study had good internal validity, it has limited generalisability because it was not possible to identify, bound, or sample the target population accurately.\n\n However, this study is the first to collect psychological distress data from an affected population during such a disease outbreak and has potential to inform those involved in assessing the potential psychological impacts of human infectious diseases, such as pandemic influenza.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2571100","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Melanie

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

the short WarwickEdinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS): findings from the Health Survey for England","abstract":"Purpose\nThe WarwickEdinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), 14 positively worded statements, is a validated instrument to measure mental wellbeing on a population level.\n\n Less is known about the population distribution of the shorter seven-item version (SWEMWBS) or its performance as an instrument to measure wellbeing.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing the Health Survey for England 20102013 (n = 27,169 adults aged 16+, nationally representative of the population), age- and sex-specific norms were estimated using means and percentiles.\n\n Criterion validity was examined using: (1) Spearman correlations (?) for SWEMWBS with General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), happiness index, EQ-VAS (2) a multinomial logit model with SWEMWBS (low, medium and high wellbeing) as the outcome and demographic, social and health behaviours as explanatory variables.\n\n Relative validity was examined by comparing SWEMWBS with WEMWBS using: (1) Spearman correlations (continuous data), and (2) the weighted kappa statistic (categorical), within population subgroups.\n\n\nResults\nMean (median) SWEMWBS was 23.7 (23.2) for men and 23.2 (23.2) for women (p = 0.100).\n\n Spearman correlations were moderately sized for the happiness index (? = 0.53, P &lt; 0.001), GHQ-12 (? = ?0.52, p &lt; 0.001) and EQ-VAS (? = 0.40, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Participants consuming &lt;1 portion of fruit and vegetables a day versus ?5 (odds ratio = 1.43 95% Confidence Interval = (1.221.66)) and current smokers versus non-smokers (1.28 (1.151.41)) were more likely to have low vs medium wellbeing.\n\n Participants who binge drank versus non-drinkers were less likely to have high versus medium wellbeing (0.81 (0.710.92)).\n\n Spearman correlations between SWEMWBS and WEMWBS were above 0.95; weighted kappa statistics showed almost perfect agreement (0.790.85).\n\n\nConclusion\nSWEMWBS distinguishes mental wellbeing between subgroups, similarly to WEMWBS, but is less sensitive to gender differences.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe

Scale (WEMWBS): a Rasch analysis using data from the Scottish Health Education Population Survey","abstract":"Background\nThe Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) was developed to meet demand for instruments to measure mental well-being.\n\n It comprises 14 positively phrased Likert-style items and fulfils classic criteria for scale development.\n\n We report here the internal construct validity of WEMWBS from the perspective of the Rasch measurement model.\n\n\nMethods\nThe model was applied to data collected from 779 respondents in Wave 12 (Autumn 2006) of the Scottish Health Education Population Survey.\n\n Respondents were aged 1674 (average 41.9) yrs.\n\n\nResults\nInitial fit to model expectations was poor.\n\n The items 'I've been feeling good about myself', 'I've been interested in new things' and 'I've been feeling cheerful' all showed significant misfit to model expectations, and were deleted.\n\n This led to a marginal improvement in fit to the model.\n\n After further analysis, more items were deleted and a strict unidimensional seven item scale (the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS)) was resolved.\n\n Many items deleted because of misfit with model expectations showed considerable bias for gender.\n\n Two retained items also demonstrated bias for gender but, at the scale level, cancelled out.\n\n One further retained item 'I've been feeling optimistic about the future' showed bias for age.\n\n The correlation between the 14 item and 7 item versions was 0.954.\nConclusion\nA short 7 item version of WEMWBS was found to satisfy the strict unidimensionality expectations of the Rasch model, and be largely free of bias.\n\n This scale, SWEMWBS, provides a raw score-interval scale transformation for use in parametric procedures.\n\n In terms of face validity, SWEMWBS presents a more restricted view of mental well-being than the 14 item WEMWBS, with most items representing aspects of psychological and eudemonic well-being, and few covering hedonic well-being or affect.\n\n However, robust measurement properties combined with brevity make SWEMWBS preferable to WEMWBS at present for monitoring mental well-being in populations.\n\n Where face validity is an issue there remain arguments for continuing to collect data on the full 14 item WEMWBS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2669062","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

We included studies evaluating the effectiveness of internet-based interventions for children, youth, and young adults (age &lt;25 years) with anxiety and/or depression and their parents.\n\n Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias regarding selection bias, allocation bias, confounding bias, blinding, data collection, and withdrawals/dropouts.\n\n We included studies rated as high or moderate quality according to the risk of bias assessment.\n\n We conducted meta-analyses using the random effects model.\n\n We calculated standardized mean difference and its 95% confidence

and Methods\nA total of 914 university students, ranged in age between 18 and 40 years old (M = 23.04, SD = 2.60), participated in an online survey.\n\n The study was performed between 30 March and 30 April 2020, during the general coronavirus quarantine.\n\n Participants completed a standard psychological questionnaire, including General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), General Self-Rated Health (GSRH), Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS).\n\n\nResults\nThe majority of students (65%) showed mild to severe GAD and a high level of perceived stress (56%).\n\n Those students who had the worst evaluated current GSRH, in comparison to the situation before the COVID-19 outbreak, also demonstrated higher levels of anxiety, perceived stress, and emotion-oriented coping styles.\n\n The study indicates that the variance of anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak may be explained for about 60% by such variables, like high stress, low general self-rated health, female gender, and frequent use of both emotion-oriented and task-oriented coping styles.\n\n\nConclusion\nUniversity students experience extremely high stress and anxiety during quarantine period and they need professional help to cope with COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n The results of this study may help prepare appropriate future intervention and effective prevention programs at universities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7532061","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Dove","authors":[{"firstname":"Aleksandra

conducted to ascertain its reliability and validity properties.\n\n\nResults\nAfter panel review and corrected item-total correlation testing, seven items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.47 to 0.56) were retained and further confirmed by significant and strong factor loadings (0.66 to 0.74).\n\n Also, other properties evaluated using both classical test theory and Rasch model were satisfactory on the seven-item scale.\n\n More specifically, reliability values such as internal consistency (? = .\n\n82) and testretest reliability (ICC = .\n\n72) were acceptable.\n\n Concurrent validity was supported by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (with depression, r = 0.425 and anxiety, r = 0.511) and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (with perceived infectability, r = 0.483 and germ aversion, r = 0.459).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe Fear of COVID-19 Scale, a seven-item scale, has robust psychometric properties.\n\n It is reliable and valid in assessing

emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience.\n Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic.\n The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n The data will be used for future reference.\n Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques.\n The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 2024 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus

remodelling of the immune system including thymic atrophy and increased frequency of senescent T cells, leading to immune compromise.\n However, physical activity, which influences immunity but declines dramatically with age, is not considered in this literature.\n We assessed immune profiles in 125 adults (5579 years) who had maintained a high level of physical activity (cycling) for much of their adult lives, 75 age?matched older adults and 55 young adults not involved in regular exercise.\n The frequency of naïve T cells and recent thymic emigrants (RTE) were both higher in cyclists compared with inactive elders, and RTE frequency in cyclists was no different to young adults.\n Compared with their less active counterparts, the cyclists had significantly higher serum levels of the thymoprotective cytokine IL?7 and lower IL?6, which promotes thymic atrophy.\n Cyclists also showed additional evidence of reduced immunesenescence, namely lower Th17 polarization and higher B regulatory cell frequency than inactive elders.\n Physical activity did not protect against all aspects of immunesenescence: CD28?ve\nCD57+ve senescent CD8 T?cell frequency did not differ between

COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element.\n\n Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders.\n\n\nMethods\nThis review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases.\n\n The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections.\n\n\nResults\nThis review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections.\n\n This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms.\n\n Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression.\n\n Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength.\n\n Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19.\nConclusion\nThis review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7186129","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Diabetes India.

were significantly higher than those of the experimental group at the preintervention stage, but this difference disappeared at the postintervention and follow-up stages.\n There were also significantly lower scores on the General Health Questionnaire subfactors of somatic symptoms and anxiety/insomnia in the experimental group than in the control group during the postintervention stage, though no differences were observed before the intervention.\n These differences no longer remained after three months.\n ANOVA revealed significant effects of the intervention over time in the experimental group.\n Effects were observed at both the postintervention and follow-up stages for self-esteem, perceived stress, satisfaction in studies, and in the somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia and severe depression aspects of the General Health Questionnaire (Cohens d = 0.38 to 4.58).\n In contrast, no effects were observed in the control group.\n Conclusion: This type of Internet-based program has the ability to reach a large number of students due to its rather short format and accessibility.\n It has already shown improvements in terms of the levels of perceived stress, psychological distress and satisfaction with studies.\n The option of online interventions could appeal specifically to students who do not seek professional help.\n However, even though these results are promising at the postintervention stage, they are limited, as indicated by the lack of significant differences between the two groups after the initial three months of follow-up.\n We still, specifically, need to improve this intervention program and, generally, need more research to address the methodological problems raised by this type of intervention.\n","id":"PMC6124718","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

(one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41

15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

next lethal viral epidemic that occurs.\n\n\nMethod\nThe 1995 Kikwit Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formally Zaire) is one of the most well studied epidemics to have occurred to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nWhen an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered.\n\n Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities.\n\n The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities.\n At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down.\n It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities.\n Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma.\n The severity of this epidemic and its long-lasting repercussions

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing

focus on Ebola Virus disease (EVD) and Zika Virus, are discussed in this commentary to illustrate the continued need of care after the resolution of the actual illness.\n Various infectious diseases have associations with mental illness, such as an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorders and Tourette syndrome in children with Group B streptococcal infection.\n Current EVD literature does not demonstrate a strong association of mental illness symptoms or diseases but there is a necessity of care that extends beyond the illness.\n Patients and their families experience depression, anxiety, trauma, suicidal ideation, panic and other manifestations.\n Zika virus has been associated neuronal injury, genetic alteration that affects fetal development and detrimental maternal mental health symptoms are being documented.\n While funding calls from the international community are present, there are no specific epidemiological data or fiscal estimates solely for mental health during or after infectious diseases epidemics or disasters that support health care providers and strengthen policies and procedures for responding to such situations.\n Therefore, those on the frontlines of epidemics including emergency physicians, primary care providers and infectious disease specialists should serve communicate this need and advocate for sustained and increased funding for mental

stigma, despite its salience for public health and stigma research, has had little examination.\n This study combines survey and case study methods to examine subjective stigma among residents of Amoy Gardens (AG), the first officially recognized site of community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong.\n A total of 903 residents of AG completed a self-report questionnaire derived from two focus groups conducted toward the end of the 3-month outbreak.\n Case studies of two residents who lived in Block E, the heart of the SARS epidemic at AG, complement the survey data.\n Findings show that stigma affected most residents and took various forms of being shunned, insulted, marginalized, and rejected in the domains of work, interpersonal relationships, use of services and schooling.\n Stigma was also associated with psychosomatic distress.\n Residents strategies for diminishing stigma varied with gender, age, education, occupation, and proximity to perceived risk factors for SARS such as residential location, previous SARS infection and the presence of ex-SARS household members.\n Residents attributed stigma to government mismanagement, contagiousness of the mysterious SARS virus, and alarmist media reporting.\n Stigma clearly decreased, but never completely disappeared, after the outbreak.\n The findings confirm and add to existing knowledge on the varied origins, correlates, and impacts of stigma.\n They also highlight the synergistic roles of inconsistent health policy responses and risk miscommunication by the media in rapidly amplifying stigma toward an unfamiliar illness.\n While recognizing the intrinsically stigmatizing nature of public health measures to control SARS, we recommend that a consistent inter-sectoral approach is needed to minimize stigma and to make an effective health response to future outbreaks.\n","id":"PMC7116975","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience.\n Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic.\n The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n The data will be used for future reference.\n Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques.\n The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 2024 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/gpsych-2020-100213","date":"2020-02-29","title":"A nationwide survey of psychological distress among Chinese people in the COVID-19 epidemic: implications and policy recommendations","abstract":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic emerged in Wuhan, China, spread nationwide and then onto half a dozen other countries between December 2019 and early 2020.

into renewed focus.\n\n\nObjective\nOur study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted interview surveys with 195 students at a large public university in the United States to understand the effects of the pandemic on their mental health and well-being.\n\n The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods.\n\n\nResults\n Of the 195 students, 138 (71%) indicated increased stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n Multiple stressors were identified that contributed to the increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive thoughts among students.\n\n These included fear and worry about their own health and of their loved ones (177/195, 91% reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty in concentrating (173/195, 89%), disruptions to sleeping patterns (168/195, 86%), decreased social interactions due to physical distancing (167/195, 86%), and increased concerns on academic performance (159/195, 82%).\n\n To cope with stress and anxiety, participants have sought support from others and helped themselves by adopting either negative or positive coping mechanisms.\n\n\nConclusions\n Due to the long-lasting pandemic situation and onerous measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on higher education.\n\n The findings of our study highlight the urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address the mental health of college

mental health.\n\n\nAims:\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of depression, anxiety and health anxiety in Turkish society during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine the factors affecting these.\n\n\nMethod:\nThe study was performed using an online questionnaire.\n\n Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI).\n\n The effects on depression, anxiety and health anxiety levels of factors such as age, sex, marital status, living with an individual aged above 60, the presence of a new Coronavirus+ patient among friends or relatives, previous and current psychiatric illness and presence of accompanying chronic disease were then investigated.\n\n\nResults:\nIn terms of HADS cut-off points, 23.6% (n = 81) of the population scored above the depression cut-off point, and 45.1% (n = 155) scored above the cut-off point for anxiety.\n\n In regression analysis, female gender, living in urban areas and previous psychiatric illness history were found as risk factors for anxiety; living in urban areas was found as risk factor for depression; and female gender, accompanying chronic disease and previous psychiatric history were found as risk factors for health anxiety.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe results of this cross-sectional study suggest that the groups most psychologically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are women, individuals with previous psychiatric illness, individuals living in urban areas and those with an accompanying chronic disease.\n\n Priority might therefore be attached to these in future psychiatric planning.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7405629","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"SAGE

In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak.\n An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China.\n A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants.\n The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days.\n Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor.\n The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%.\n The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19.

However, many of them are known to work in a stressful environment which may affect their mental well-being; the situation could be worse in rapidly transforming societies such as China.\n\n The purpose of this study was to investigate anxiety symptoms and the associated factors in Chinese nurses working in public city hospitals.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was performed for Chinese nurses in public city hospitals of Liaoning Province, northeast China.\n\n Seven hospitals in different areas of the province were randomly selected for the study.\n\n The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale was used to measure anxiety symptoms.\n\n Effort-reward imbalance questionnaire and Job Content Questionnaire were used to assess the work stressors.\n\n Univariate analysis and stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to identify the factors associated with anxiety symptoms.\n\n\nResults\nAll registered nurses in the seven city hospitals, totaling 1807 registered nurses were surveyed.\n\n Of the returned questionnaires, 1437 were valid (79.5%) for analysis.\n\n Utilizing the total raw score???40 as the cut-off point, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms in these nurses was 43.4%.\n\n Demographic factors (education, chronic disease and life event), lifestyle factors (regular meals and physical exercise), work conditions (hospital grade, job rank, monthly salary, nurse-patient relationships, job satisfaction and intention of leaving), job content (social support and decision latitude), effort-reward imbalance and overcommitment were all significantly related to the anxiety symptoms.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed main factors associated with anxiety symptoms were lower job rank (OR 2.501), overcommitment (OR 2.018), chronic diseases (OR 1.541), worse nurse-patient relationship (OR 1.434), higher social support (OR 0.573), lower hospital grade (OR 0.629), taking regular meals (OR 0.719) and higher level of job satisfaction (OR 0.722).\n\n\nConclusions\nA large proportion of Chinese nurses working in public city hospitals had anxiety symptoms, which warrants immediate investigation and intervention from the hospital administrators.\n\n Meanwhile, results of the study suggest that proper counseling, promotion of healthy lifestyle behavior and improvements to the social environment in the work place may be helpful toward reducing or preventing the anxiety symptoms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3492072","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

syndrome (SARS), and four of them sacrificed their life in the course of their work with SARS patients.\n This study attempted to identify the stage-specific difficulties encountered by Taiwan's surviving frontline nurses during the anti-SARS process.\n A two-step within-method qualitative triangulation research design was used to obtain the in-depth and confidential thoughts of 200 participants during the precaring, tangible caring, and postcaring stages.\n Six major types of stage-specific difficulties with and threats to the quality of care of SARS patients were identified according to each specific stage of the caring process.\n Four themes were further explored; these are discussed to provide a background context in obtaining better understanding of the multifaceted needs of nurses during this crisis.\n Consequently, a conceptual framework was developed to depict this complex phenomenon.\n","id":"PMC7127079","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 2324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·472·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·87·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227805), 113 (57193), 98 (49168), 111 (56191), and 80 (40139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 12 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/070674370905400504","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The psychological impact of the SARS epidemic on hospital employees in China: exposure, risk perception, and altruistic acceptance of risk","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30046-8","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Timely mental health care for the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is urgently needed","abstract":"","id":"PMC7128153","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Yu-Tao","surname":"Xiang","email":"xyutly@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qinge","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Teris","surname":"Cheung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chee H","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.7150/ijbs.45221","date":"2020-02-28","title":"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among Chinese residents during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 outbreak: a quick online cross-sectional survey","abstract":"Unprecedented measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China.\n People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak.\n An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China.\n A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants.\n The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days.\n Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor.\n The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%.\n The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days.\n In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P&lt;0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019. Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for Chinese residents to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices.\n Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to populations of a low socioeconomic status.\n","id":"PMC7098034","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Ivyspring International Publisher","authors":[{"firstname":"Bao-Liang","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hai-Mei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qian-Qian","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Ge","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-Tian","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1080/09638237.2018.1437614","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Improving the health of mental health staff through exercise interventions: A systematic review","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01890","date":"2015-11-23","title":"Neuromodulation of Aerobic ExerciseA Review","abstract":"Running, and aerobic exercise in general, is a physical activity that increasingly many people engage in but that also has become popular as a topic for scientific research.\n Here we review the available studies investigating whether and to which degree aerobic exercise modulates hormones, amino acids, and neurotransmitters levels.\n In general, it seems that factors such as genes, gender, training status, and hormonal status need to be taken into account to gain a better understanding of the neuromodular underpinnings of aerobic exercise.\n More research using longitudinal studies and considering individual differences is necessary to determine actual benefits.\n We suggest that, in order to succeed, aerobic exercise programs should include optimal periodization, prevent overtraining and be tailored to interindividual differences, including neuro-developmental and genetically-based factors.\n","id":"PMC4703784","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Saskia","surname":"Heijnen","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Bernhard","surname":"Hommel","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Armin","surname":"Kibele","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lorenza S.","surname":"Colzato","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The impact of headache in Europe: principal results of the Eurolight project.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Migraine is first cause of disability in under 50s: will health politicians now take notice?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Diagnosis and management of headache: a review.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Global, regional, and national burden of neurological disorders, 1990-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Comparison of chronic daily headache with and without medication overuse headache using ICHD II R and ICHD 3 beta criteria.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Revised guidelines of the French headache society for the diagnosis and management of migraine in adults.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World Health Organization.

multiplicity of infection [MOI] 0·1) or did mock infection.\n\n On day 3 post-infection, we inoculated the same cultures with IAV (H1N1 green fluorescent protein [GFP] reporter virus or H1N1pdm09; MOI 0·1).\n\n We used reverse transcription quantitative PCR or microscopy to quantify host cell mRNAs for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) on day 3 after rhinovirus or mock infection and IAV RNA on days 4, 5, or 6 after rhinovirus or mock infection.\n\n We also did sequential infection studies in the presence of BX795 (6 ?M), to inhibit the interferon response.\n\n We compared ISG expression and IAV RNA and expression of GFP by IAV reporter virus.\n\n\nFindings\nid='P6'>Between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2019, examination of 8284 respiratory samples positive for either rhinovirus (n=3821) or IAV (n=4463) by any test method was used to establish Nov 1 to March 1 as the period of peak virus co-circulation.\n\n After filtering for samples within this time frame meeting the inclusion criteria (n=13 707), there were 989 (7·2%) rhinovirus and 922 (6·7%) IAV detections, with a significantly lower than expected odds of co-detection (odds ratio 0·16, 95% CI 0·090·28).\n\n Rhinovirus infection of cell cultures induced ISG expression and protected against IAV infection 3 days later, resulting in an approximate 50 000-fold decrease in IAV H1N1pdm09 viral RNA on day 5 post-rhinovirus inoculation.\n\n Blocking the interferon response restored IAV replication following rhinovirus infection.\n\n\nInterpretation\nid='P7'>These findings show that one respiratory virus can block infection with another through stimulation of antiviral defences in the airway mucosa, supporting the idea that interference from rhinovirus disrupted the 2009 IAV pandemic in Europe.\n\n These results indicate that viral interference can potentially affect the course of an epidemic, and this possibility should be considered when designing interventions for seasonal influenza epidemics and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nFunding\nid='P8'>National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and the Yale Department of Laboratory Medicine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7580833","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"NULL","authors":[{"firstname":"Anchi","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Valia T","surname":"Mihaylova","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marie L","surname":"Landry","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ellen F","surname":"Foxman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1911083116","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Virusvirus interactions impact the population dynamics of influenza and the common cold","abstract":"When multiple pathogens cocirculate this can lead to competitive or cooperative forms of pathogenpathogen interactions.\n It is believed that such interactions occur among cold and flu viruses, perhaps through broad-acting immunity, resulting in interlinked epidemiological patterns of infection.\n However, to date, quantitative evidence has been limited.\n We analyzed a large collection of diagnostic reports collected over multiple years for 11 respiratory viruses.\n Our analyses provide strong statistical support for the existence of interactions among respiratory viruses.\n Using computer simulations, we found that very short-lived interferences may explain why common cold infections are less frequent during flu seasons.\n Improved understanding of how the epidemiology of viral infections is interlinked can help improve disease forecasting and evaluation of disease control interventions.\n","id":"PMC6936719","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"National Academy of Sciences","authors":[{"firstname":"Sema","surname":"Nickbakhsh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Colette","surname":"Mair","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Louise","surname":"Matthews","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Reeve","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Reeve","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul C.

of COVID-19 Home Confinement on Eating Behaviour and Physical Activity: Results of the ECLB-COVID19 International Online Survey","abstract":"Background: Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home confinement.\n While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined.\n Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions.\n This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours.\n Methods: Following a structured review of the literature, the Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19) Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics.\n The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform.\n Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages.\n Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses before and during confinement conditions.\n Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis.\n The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall).\n Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day.\n Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly.\n Conclusion: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction.\n A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.\n","id":"PMC7352706","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Achraf","surname":"Ammar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Brach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Khaled","surname":"Trabelsi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamdi","surname":"Chtourou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Boukhris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liwa","surname":"Masmoudi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bassem","surname":"Bouaziz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ellen","surname":"Bentlage","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniella","surname":"How","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mona","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Notger","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Asma","surname":"Aloui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omar","surname":"Hammouda","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laisa

common belief that screen time (SCT) is a key factor in high overall sedentary time (ST) and is often used as a primary outcome.\n\n However, the evidence is lacking.\n\n Therefore, this study investigated the association of objectively assessed total ST with SCT among children.\n\n Further, SCT was investigated separately for sedentary level, weight status, gender, and migration background.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>For 198 primary school children (7.1?±?0.7?years, boys: 43.9%) ST was assessed objectively using a multi-sensor device (Actiheart®; CamNtech, Cambridge, UK).\n\n The sample was split into three groups (tertiles) to investigate SCT of children with low, medium and high ST.\n\n SCT and socio-demographic parameters, such as migration background, were assessed using a parental questionnaire; anthropometric data was collected at schools.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Absolut SCT did not differ significantly among the three sedentary groups: Daily average of SCT was 83.8?±?55.0?min (27.4% of ST) for children with high ST, 82.8?±?50.5?min (39.8% of ST) for children with medium ST, and 77.2?±?59.4?min (71.3% of ST) for those with low ST.\n\n However, relatively the SCT percentage of total ST was significantly higher among children with low ST (p?&lt;?0.01).\n\n Significantly higher SCT was found in children with migration background (p?&lt;?0.01), while underweight children had significantly less SCT (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n An association of total SCT and overall ST was found for the whole sample (B?=?17.11, [2.75; 31.48], p?=?0.02), but did not remain when analysis were separated for the groups, except for normal weight children (B?=?15.97, [0.13; 31.81], p?=?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>The amount of SCT is the same among high, low and medium sedentary children, and high ST is largely independent of SCT.\n\n Therefore, SCT cannot be the key contributor to high ST and should not solely be used for predicting or changing childrens sedentary behaviour.\n\n Moreover, childrens weight status to classify activity levels and the role of possible compensation mechanisms should be considered in future research and when trying to intervene on ST.\n\n\nTrial registration\nid='Par5'>German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS), DRKS-ID: DRKS00000494 DATE:

the short WarwickEdinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS): findings from the Health Survey for England","abstract":"Purpose\nThe WarwickEdinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), 14 positively worded statements, is a validated instrument to measure mental wellbeing on a population level.\n\n Less is known about the population distribution of the shorter seven-item version (SWEMWBS) or its performance as an instrument to measure wellbeing.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing the Health Survey for England 20102013 (n = 27,169 adults aged 16+, nationally representative of the population), age- and sex-specific norms were estimated using means and percentiles.\n\n Criterion validity was examined using: (1) Spearman correlations (?) for SWEMWBS with General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), happiness index, EQ-VAS (2) a multinomial logit model with SWEMWBS (low, medium and high wellbeing) as the outcome and demographic, social and health behaviours as explanatory variables.\n\n Relative validity was examined by comparing SWEMWBS with WEMWBS using: (1) Spearman correlations (continuous data), and (2) the weighted kappa statistic (categorical), within population subgroups.\n\n\nResults\nMean (median) SWEMWBS was 23.7 (23.2) for men and 23.2 (23.2) for women (p = 0.100).\n\n Spearman correlations were moderately sized for the happiness index (? = 0.53, P &lt; 0.001), GHQ-12 (? = ?0.52, p &lt; 0.001) and EQ-VAS (? = 0.40, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Participants consuming &lt;1 portion of fruit and vegetables a day versus ?5 (odds ratio = 1.43 95% Confidence Interval = (1.221.66)) and current smokers versus non-smokers (1.28 (1.151.41)) were more likely to have low vs medium wellbeing.\n\n Participants who binge drank versus non-drinkers were less likely to have high versus medium wellbeing (0.81 (0.710.92)).\n\n Spearman correlations between SWEMWBS and WEMWBS were above 0.95; weighted kappa statistics showed almost perfect agreement (0.790.85).\n\n\nConclusion\nSWEMWBS distinguishes mental wellbeing between subgroups, similarly to WEMWBS, but is less sensitive to gender differences.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe

recommended as a cost-effective method to assess physical activity.\n\n Several studies validating the IPAQ-SF have been conducted with differing results, but no systematic review of these studies has been reported.\n\n\nMethods\nThe keywords 'IPAQ', 'validation', and 'validity' were searched in PubMed and Scopus.\n\n Studies published in English that validated the IPAQ-SF against an objective physical activity measuring device, doubly labeled water, or an objective fitness measure were included.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-three validation studies were included in this review.\n\n There was a great deal of variability in the methods used across studies, but the results were largely similar.\n\n Correlations between the total physical activity level measured by the IPAQ-SF and objective standards ranged from 0.09 to 0.39; none reached the minimal acceptable standard in the literature (0.50 for objective activity measuring devices, 0.40 for fitness measures).\n\n Correlations between sections of the IPAQ-SF for vigorous activity or moderate activity level/walking and an objective standard showed even greater variability (-0.18 to 0.76), yet several reached the minimal acceptable standard.\n\n Only six studies provided comparisons between physical activity levels derived from the IPAQ-SF and those obtained from objective criterion.\n\n In most studies the IPAQ-SF overestimated physical activity level by 36 to 173 percent; one study underestimated by 28 percent.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe correlation between the IPAQ-SF and objective measures of activity or fitness in the large majority of studies was lower than the acceptable standard.\n\n Furthermore, the IPAQ-SF typically overestimated physical activity as measured by objective criterion by an average of 84 percent.\n\n Hence, the evidence to support the use of the IPAQ-SF as an indicator of relative or absolute physical activity is weak.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3214824","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

the Tunisian case and lessons for global epidemics in the context of 3PM strategies","abstract":"id='Par1'>Covid-19 is neither the first nor the last viral epidemic which societies around the world are, were and will be affected by.\n Which lessons should be taken from the current pandemic situation? The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterised, and many research teams all over the world are working on prediction of the epidemic scenario, protective measures to populations and sub-populations, therapeutic and vaccination issues, amongst others.\n Contextually, countries with currently low numbers of Covid-19-infected individuals such as Tunisia are intended to take lessons from those countries which already reached the exponential phase of the infection distribution as well as from those which have the exponential phase behind them and record a minor number of new cases such as China.\n To this end, in Tunisia, the pandemic wave has started with a significant delay compared with Europe, the main economic partner of the country.\n In this paper, we do analyse the current pandemic situation in this country by studying the infection evolution and considering potential protective strategies to prevent a pandemic scenario.\n The model is predictive based on a large number of undetected Covid-19 cases that is particularly true for some country regions such as Sfax.\n Infection distribution and mortality rate analysis demonstrate a highly heterogeneous picture over the country.\n Qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis leads to a conclusion that the reliable real-time monitoring based on the randomised laboratory tests is the optimal predictive strategy to create the most effective evidence-based preventive measures.\n In contrast, lack of tests may lead to incorrect political decisions causing either unnecessary over-protection of the population that is risky for a long-term economic recession, or under-protection of the population leading to a post-containment pandemic rebound.\n Recommendations are provided in the context of advanced predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medical approach.\n","id":"PMC7182506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer International

died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

total moderate and vigorous physical activity were compared using Spearman rank-order correlations.\n\n Changes in physical activity between baseline and 3-month assessments were correlated to examine responsiveness to change.\n\n The data were stratified to assess outcomes according to different subgroups (e.\n\ng.\n\n, gender, age, weight, activity levels).\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>With regards to the validity, a significant correlation of ??=?0.19 was found for moderate physical activity, ??=?0.33 for vigorous physical activity and ??=?0.23 for moderate and vigorous physical activity combined.\n\n For vigorous physical activity correlations were higher than 0.3 for most subgroups, whereas they were only higher than 0.3 in those with a healthy weight for the other activity outcomes.\n\n With regards to responsiveness to change, a correlation of ??=?0.32 was found for moderate physical activity, ??=?0.19 for vigorous physical activity and ??=?0.35 for moderate and vigorous physical activity combined.\n\n For moderate and vigorous activity combined correlations were higher than 0.4 for several subgroups, but never for vigorous physical activity.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Little evidence for the validity of Active Australia Survey was found, although the responsiveness to change was acceptable for several subgroups.\n\n Findings from studies using the Active Australia Survey should be interpreted with caution.\n\n\nTrial registration\nid='Par5'>World Health Organisation Universal Trial Number: U1111119-1755.

physical activity, and self-determination theory: A systematic review","abstract":"Background\nMotivation is a critical factor in supporting sustained exercise, which in turn is associated with important health outcomes.\n\n Accordingly, research on exercise motivation from the perspective of self-determination theory (SDT) has grown considerably in recent years.\n\n Previous reviews have been mostly narrative and theoretical.\n\n Aiming at a more comprehensive review of empirical data, this article examines the empirical literature on the relations between key SDT-based constructs and exercise and physical activity behavioral outcomes.\n\n\nMethods\nThis systematic review includes 66 empirical studies published up to June 2011, including experimental, cross-sectional, and prospective studies that have measured exercise causality orientations, autonomy/need support and need satisfaction, exercise motives (or goal contents), and exercise self-regulations and motivation.\n\n We also studied SDT-based interventions aimed at increasing exercise behavior.\n\n In all studies, actual or self-reported exercise/physical activity, including attendance, was analyzed as the dependent variable.\n\n Findings are summarized based on quantitative analysis of the evidence.\n\n\nResults\nThe results show consistent support for a positive relation between more autonomous forms of motivation and exercise, with a trend towards identified regulation predicting initial/short-term adoption more strongly than intrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation being more predictive of long-term exercise adherence.\n\n The literature is also consistent in that competence satisfaction and more intrinsic motives positively predict exercise participation across a range of samples and settings.\n\n Mixed evidence was found concerning the role of other types of motives (e.\n\ng.\n\n, health/fitness and body-related), and also the specific nature and consequences of introjected regulation.\n\n The majority of studies have employed descriptive (i.\n\ne.\n\n, non-experimental) designs but similar results are found across cross-sectional, prospective, and experimental designs.\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, the literature provides good evidence for the value of SDT in understanding exercise behavior, demonstrating the importance of autonomous (identified and intrinsic) regulations in fostering physical activity.\n\n Nevertheless, there remain some inconsistencies and mixed evidence with regard to the relations between specific SDT constructs and exercise.\n\n Particular limitations concerning the different associations explored in the literature are discussed in the context of refining the application of SDT to exercise and physical activity promotion, and integrating these with avenues for future research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3441783","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Pedro

State Anxiety","abstract":"Anxiety is a significant mental health issue in modern society and empirical research into effective interventions to address anxiety has been extensive.\n Spending time in nature is one approach that has demonstrated anxiolytic effects.\n However, in some situations and contexts spending time in nature in order to reduce anxiety symptoms may not be possible.\n For example, in therapeutic settings delivered in a space with no access or exposure to any nature stimuli in the immediate surrounding environment.\n Guided imagery (GI) has also proven to be effective for reducing anxiety symptoms.\n Thus, nature-based GI might help to overcome the limitation of access to nature and strengthen the impact of GI interventions.\n The current study investigated the effectiveness of nature-based GI on anxiety reduction.\n Participants (n = 48, 18 males, 30 females, Mage = 34.54, SDage = 12.91, age range = 19  71 years) with moderate levels of either trait or state anxiety as measured by the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) were recruited.\n Participants undertook both a nature-based GI session and a traditional non-nature-based GI session and their pre- and post- state anxiety levels were measured in each GI session.\n It was anticipated that post state anxiety scores would be significantly lower for both GI conditions and that a significantly greater anxiety reduction would be found in the nature-based GI than the urban-based GI.\n A two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures revealed results that supported both hypotheses.\n This study was the first to compare a nature based GI intervention with a traditional (non-nature based) GI intervention.\n Findings indicate that nature-based GI interventions are effective anxiety management interventions that have the added benefit of being cost-effective and easily accessible.\n","id":"PMC6176042","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

population ages.\n\n Physical activity (PA) significantly reduces all-cause mortality and contributes to the prevention of many chronic illnesses.\n\n However, the proportion of people globally who are active enough to gain these health benefits is low and decreases with age.\n\n Social support (SS) is a social determinant of health that may improve PA in older adults, but the association has not been systematically reviewed.\n\n\nMethods\nQuantitative studies examining a relationship between SS, or loneliness, and PA levels in healthy, older adults over 60 were identified using MEDLINE, PSYCInfo, SportDiscus, CINAHL and PubMed, and through reference lists of included studies.\n\n Quality of these studies was rated.\n\n\nResults\nThis review included 27 papers, of which 22 were cross sectional studies, three were prospective/longitudinal and two were intervention studies.\n\n Overall, the study quality was moderate.\n\n Four articles examined the relation of PA with general SS, 17 with SS specific to PA (SSPA), and six with loneliness.\n\n The results suggest that there is a positive association between SSPA and PA levels in older adults, especially when it comes from family members.\n\n No clear associations were identified between general SS, SSPA from friends, or loneliness and PA levels.\n\n When measured separately, leisure time PA (LTPA) was associated with SS in a greater percentage of studies than when a number of PA domains were measured together.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe evidence surrounding the relationship between SS, or loneliness, and PA in older adults suggests that people with greater SS for PA are more likely to do LTPA, especially when the SS comes from family members.\n\n However, high variability in measurement methods used to assess both SS

environment in human health and well-being.\n\n However, the evidence-base for specific and direct health or well-being benefits of activity within natural compared to more synthetic environments has not been systematically assessed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a systematic review to collate and synthesise the findings of studies that compare measurements of health or well-being in natural and synthetic environments.\n\n Effect sizes of the differences between environments were calculated and meta-analysis used to synthesise data from studies measuring similar outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-five studies met the review inclusion criteria.\n\n Most of these studies were crossover or controlled trials that investigated the effects of short-term exposure to each environment during a walk or run.\n\n This included 'natural' environments, such as public parks and green university campuses, and synthetic environments, such as indoor and outdoor built environments.\n\n The most common outcome measures were scores of different self-reported emotions.\n\n Based on these data, a meta-analysis provided some evidence of a positive benefit of a walk or run in a natural environment in comparison to a synthetic environment.\n\n There was also some support for greater attention after exposure to a natural environment but not after adjusting effect sizes for pretest differences.\n\n Meta-analysis of data on blood pressure and cortisol concentrations found less evidence of a consistent difference between environments across studies.\n\n\nConclusions\nOverall, the studies are suggestive that natural environments may have direct and positive impacts on well-being, but support the need for investment in further research on this question to understand the general significance for public health.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2924288","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Diana

and other lifestyles, and socioeconomic and demographic status, the underlying cause of death of 24,656 adults (21% aged 3064, 79% aged 65 or above) who died in 1998 in Hong Kong, and the weekly proportion of specimens positive for influenza A (H3N1 and H1N1) and B isolations during the same period.\n\n We assessed the excess risks (ER) of influenza-associated mortality due to all-natural causes, cardiovascular diseases, or respiratory disease among different levels of exercise: never/seldom (less than once per month), low/moderate (once per month to three times per week), and frequent (four times or more per week) by Poisson regression.\n\n We also assessed the differences in ER between exercise groups by case-only logistic regression.\n\n For all the mortality outcomes under study in relation to each 10% increase in weekly proportion of specimens positive for influenza A+B, never/seldom exercise (as reference) was associated with 5.8% to 8.5% excess risks (ER) of mortality (P&lt;0.0001), while low/moderate exercise was associated with ER which were 4.2% to 6.4% lower than those of the reference (P&lt;0.001 for all-natural causes; P?=?0.001 for cardiovascular; and P?=?0.07 for respiratory mortality).\n\n Frequent exercise was not different from the reference (change in ER ?0.8% to 1.7%, P?=?0.30 to 0.73).\n\n\nConclusion\nWhen compared with never or seldom

first, holistic immunological model of COVID?19: Implications for prevention, diagnosis, and public health measures","abstract":"The natural history of COVID?19 caused by SARS?CoV?2 is extremely variable, ranging from asymptomatic or mild infection, mainly in children, to multi?organ failure, eventually fatal, mainly in the eldest.\n We propose here the first model explaining how the outcome of first, crucial 10?15 days after infection, depends on the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, mannose?binding lectin).\n If SARS?CoV?2 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens.\n The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high?affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm), leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal.\n Low?moderate physical activity can still be recommended.\n However, extreme physical activity and oral breathing with hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID?19 facilitates re?inhalation and early direct penetration of high numbers of own virus particles in the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airways mucosae covered by neutralizing antibodies ('viral auto?inhalation' phenomenon).\n This allows the virus to bypass the efficient immune barrier of the upper airway mucosa in already infected, young, and otherwise healthy athletes.\n In conclusion, whether the virus or the adaptive immune response reaches the lungs first is a crucial factor deciding the fate of the patient.\n This quantitative and time?/sequence?dependent model has several implications for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID?19 at all ages.\n","id":"PMC7267459","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

18, 2020. It is unknown whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaks (eg, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19).\n We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks.\n We included 16 of 616 identified articles.\n School closures were deployed rapidly across mainland China and Hong Kong for COVID-19. However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control.\n Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic.\n Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results.\n Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 24% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions.\n Policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19, and that combinations of social distancing measures should be considered.\n Other less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools require further consideration if restrictive social distancing policies are implemented for long periods.\n","id":"PMC7270629","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Russell M","surname":"Viner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simon J","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Helen","surname":"Croker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jessica","surname":"Packer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Ward","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claire","surname":"Stansfield","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Oliver","surname":"Mytton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chris","surname":"Bonell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Booy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: rapid review of the evidence","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Banerjee D.

the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 89 and a 5-min Apgar score of 910. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

are fairly good data to support an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety, and also that untreated, these problems can continue into adulthood, growing in severity.\n Thus, knowing how to recognize and respond to anxiety in adolescents is of the utmost importance in primary care settings.\n To that end, this article provides an up-to-date review of the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders geared towards professionals in primary care settings.\n Topics covered include subtypes, clinical presentation, the etiology and biology, effective screening instruments, evidence-based treatments (both medication and therapy), and the long-term prognosis for adolescents with anxiety.\n Importantly, we focus on the most common types of anxiety disorders, often known as phobias, which include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety/social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and specific phobias.\n In summary, anxiety is a common psychiatric problem for adolescents, but armed with the right tools, primary care providers can make a major impact.\n","id":"PMC3916014","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Dove Medical

care setting towards a national outbreak of an infectious disease","abstract":"Objective\nThe psychological and coping responses of the noninfected community towards infectious disease outbreaks are relatively understudied.\n\n This cross-sectional study sought to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities and associated coping styles within the general population visiting community health care services.\n\n\nMethods\nIt was conducted on individuals attending community polyclinics in Singapore within the first week of July 2003, 16 weeks after the first national outbreak of SARS.\n\n The General Health Questionnaire-28, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Brief COPE were used to determine the prevalence rates of psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities and employed coping strategies respectively.\n\n\nResults\nThe overall response rate was 78.0%.\n\n Of the 415 community health care setting respondents, we found significant rates of SARS-related psychiatric (22.9%) and posttraumatic morbidities (25.8%).\n\n The presence of psychiatric morbidity was associated with the presence of high level of posttraumatic symptoms [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.244.13, P=.\n\n008].\n\n Psychiatric morbidity was further associated with being seen at fever stations (adjusted OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.083.34, P=.\n\n026), younger age (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.940.98, P=.\n\n021), increased self blame (adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.222.28, P=.\n\n001), less substance use (adjusted OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.560.98, P=.\n\n034) and posttraumatic morbidity was associated with increased use of denial (adjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.041.67, P=.\n\n024), and planning (adjusted OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.161.95, P=.\n\n002) as coping measures.\n\n\nConclusion\nThese findings could potentially inform the development of practical community mental health programs for future infectious disease outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094450","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

altruists cannot help: the influence of altruism on the mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>The positive predictive effect of altruism on physical and psychological well-being has been extensively demonstrated in previous studies, but few studies have examined the effect of altruism on negative mental health outcomes when altruists cannot perform altruistic behaviours.\n\n This study explored the influence of altruism on negative affect and mental health (anxiety and depressive symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic while people self-isolated at home in China.\n\n\nMethod\nid='Par2'>University students were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China.\n\n Self-reported perceived risk, altruism, negative affect, anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the Self-Report Altruism Scale (SRA scale), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-9).\n\n A structural equation model was used to analyse the mediating and moderating effects on mental health.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The final sample comprised 1346 Chinese participants (Mage?=?19.76?±?2.23?years, 73% female).\n\n Overall, the higher the risk the participants perceived, the more negative affect they exhibited (??=?0.16, p?&lt;?.\n\n001), and thus, the more anxious and depressed they felt (??=?0.134, p?&lt;?.\n\n001); however, this relationship between risk perception and negative affect was moderated by altruism.\n\n In contrast to previous studies, the increase in negative affect associated with the increased perceived risk was pronounced among individuals with high altruism (t?=?7.68, p?&lt;?.\n\n001).\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Individuals with high altruism exhibited more negative affect than those with low altruism, which indirectly increased their anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n\n These findings enrich theories of altruism and provide valuable insight into the influence of altruism on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7348110","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

July 2003, 16 weeks after the first national outbreak of SARS.\n\n The General Health Questionnaire-28, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Brief COPE were used to determine the prevalence rates of psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities and employed coping strategies respectively.\n\n\nResults\nThe overall response rate was 78.0%.\n\n Of the 415 community health care setting respondents, we found significant rates of SARS-related psychiatric (22.9%) and posttraumatic morbidities (25.8%).\n\n The presence of psychiatric morbidity was associated with the presence of high level of

concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience.\n Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic.\n The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n The data will be used for future reference.\n Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques.\n The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 2024 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia,

0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus

disease 2019 (COVID-19) that overwhelmed health care systems and caused severe economic and educational deficits, in addition to anxiety among the public.\n The main aim of this study was to evaluate the mutual effects of belief that the pandemic was the result of a conspiracy on knowledge and anxiety levels among students at the University of Jordan (UJ).\n An electronic-based survey was conducted between 29 March, 2020 and 31 March, 2020. The targeted population involved all undergraduate and postgraduate students from the health, scientific and humanities schools at UJ.\n Survey sections included 26 items on: socio-demographic information, knowledge and sources of information about the disease, attitude towards the false notion that COVID-19 stemmed from a conspiracy and items to assess the anxiety level among students during the quarantine period.\n The total number of participants was 1540 students.\n The mean age of study participants was 22 years and females predominated the study population (n = 1145, 74.4%).\n The majority of participants perceived the disease as moderately dangerous (n = 1079, 70.1%).\n Males, Jordanians and participants with lower income were more inclined to feel that COVID-19 is very dangerous.\n A lower level of knowledge and a higher level of anxiety about COVID-19 were associated with the belief that the disease is part of a conspiracy.\n Females and participants with lower income were more likely to believe that the disease is related to conspiracy.\n Belief in conspiracy regarding the origin of COVID-19 was associated with misinformation about the availability of a vaccine and the therapeutic use of antibiotics for COVID-19 treatment.\n The Ministry of Health in Jordan was the most common source of information about COVID-19 reported by the participants (n = 1018).\n The false belief that COVID-19 was the result of a global conspiracy could be the consequence of a lower level of knowledge about the virus and could lead to a higher level of anxiety, which should be considered in the awareness tools of various media platforms about the current pandemic.\n","id":"PMC7399915","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Malik","surname":"Sallam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Deema","surname":"Dababseh","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Deema","surname":"Dababseh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alaa","surname":"Yaseen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ayat","surname":"Al-Haidar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nidaa A.","surname":"Ababneh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Faris G.","surname":"Bakri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Azmi","surname":"Mahafzah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1038/s41590-017-0007-9","date":"2017-10-30","title":"Emerging viral diseases from a vaccinology perspective: preparing for the next pandemic","abstract":"id='Par1'>Emerging infectious diseases will continue to threaten public health and are sustained by global commerce, travel and disruption of ecological systems.\n Most pandemic threats are caused by viruses from either zoonotic sources or vector-borne sources.\n Developing better ways to anticipate and manage the ongoing microbial challenge will be critical for achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and, conversely, each such goal will affect the ability to control infectious diseases.\n Here we discuss how technology can be applied effectively to better prepare for and respond to new viral diseases with a focus on new paradigms for vaccine development.\n","id":"PMC7097586","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group US","authors":[{"firstname":"Barney S.","surname":"Graham","email":"bgraham@nih.gov","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy J.","surname":"Sullivan","email":"nsullivan@nih.gov","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nancy J.","surname":"Sullivan","email":"nsullivan@nih.gov","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature05775","date":"2007-03-22","title":"Origins of major human infectious diseases","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature05775) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7095142","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Nathan D.","surname":"Wolfe","email":"nwolfe@ucla.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claire Panosian","surname":"Dunavan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jared","surname":"Diamond","email":"jdiamond@geog.ucla.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMp2002106","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Escaping Pandora's Box:Another Novel Coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmj.m1036","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Covid-19: WHO declares pandemic because of &quot;alarming levels&quot;

outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases.\n\n Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately.\n\n We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).\n\n\nResults\n660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020).\n\n After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses.\n\n Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed separately.\n\n For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.592.9%), cough (57.6%, 95%CI 40.874.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95%CI 10.980.4%) were the most prevalent manifestations.\n\n Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.030.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95%CI 13.751.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.19.3) with shock.\n\n Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.221.5%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR).\n\n\nConclusion\nCOVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in patients with comorbidities.\n\n ICU was required for approximately 20% of polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a CFR of &gt;13%.\n\n As this virus spreads globally, countries need to urgently prepare human resources, infrastructure and facilities to treat severe COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7102608","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Alfonso

implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences,

the entire world.\n The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\n Two other coronavirus infectionsSARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans.\n All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by ?-coronaviruses.\n Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common.\n Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products.\n Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas.\n In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERSCoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10, 2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on

initial 16,377 studies identified, only 6 met our inclusion criteria.\n\n These studies included a total of 3310 physicians.\n\n The general prevalence of BS was 48%.\n\n The prevalence in neurosurgeons was 51.1%, higher than that recorded in neurosurgical residents (45.4%).\n\n Regarding subdimensions, personal accomplishment seemed to be the most influential factor for burnout

administration (postal, telephone, face-to-face).\n\n Low response rates may result in estimates that are biased by selective non-response.\n\n We examined non-response bias in the NZ GENACIS survey, a postal survey of a random electoral roll sample, with a response rate of 49.5% (n?=?1924).\n\n Our aim was to estimate the magnitude of non-response bias in estimating the prevalence of current

related to the amount of effort required from the researchers to elicit a response.\n\n First, the demographic characteristics of respondents and non-respondents were compared.\n\n Second, respondents who returned their questionnaire before the first reminder (early), before the second reminder (intermediate) or after the second reminder (late) were compared by demographic characteristics, 12-month prevalence of drinking and prevalence of binge drinking.\n\n\nResults\nDemographic characteristics and prevalence of binge drinking were significantly different between late respondents and early/intermediate respondents, with the demographics of early and intermediate respondents being similar to people who refused to participate while late respondents were similar to all other non-respondents.\n\n Assuming non-respondents who did not actively refuse to participate had the same drinking patterns as late respondents, the prevalence of binge drinking amongst current drinkers was underestimated.\n\n Adjusting the prevalence of binge drinkers amongst current drinkers using population weights showed that this method of adjustment still resulted in an underestimate of the prevalence.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe findings suggest non-respondents who did not actively refuse to participate are likely to have similar or more extreme drinking behaviours than late respondents, and that surveys of health compromising behaviours such as alcohol use are likely to underestimate the prevalence of these behaviours.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3332039","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

the PIMS-CoV 19 study\nHighlights\nCompared to previous studies in China, greater levels of anxiety were reported among French students in an area particularly affected by the disease, with more than half of these students experiencing anxiety.\nFemale gender and having relatives or acquaintances from their residence hospitalized for COVID-19 were the main risk factors for moderate to severe anxiety.\nSupport from family and support from friends were protective factors against anxiety.\nThe COVID-19 has sent billions of students worldwide into lockdown. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety and identify the factors associated with anxiety among French students during lockdown.A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect sociodemographic data, living and learning conditions, anxiety symptoms and social support. Among 3936 students, 15.2%, experienced moderate anxiety and 9.8%, severe anxiety.Female gender (OR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.8-2.7) and having relatives or acquaintances from their housing hospitalized for COVID-19 (OR=3.3, 95% CI: 1.4-7.9) were the main risk factors for anxiety. Tensions at home (OR=1.8, 95% CI: 1.5-2.1), difficulties isolating (OR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6), noises inside (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-1.9) or outside the housing (OR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.3-1.8), no direct outdoor access (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.0), delay in final examination (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.1), reduced time for learning (OR=1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6), increased tobacco consumption (OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.4-2.6), ineffectiveness of using media entertainment (OR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.1-4.4) and reading (OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.7) to calm down, were identified as risk factors. Family (OR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.8-0.91) and friend (OR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.82-0.94) support were protective factors. This suggests the need to focus on students during epidemics, especially those living with someone hospitalized with COVID-19.\nBackground\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first identified in Wuhan city in East China in December 2019, has spread at an alarming rate and become a major challenging global public health problem. In response to this pandemic situation, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. Although the mortality rate of COVID-19 outside China was initially rather low, leading to the expectation that the effect of the disease on the health of individuals in other countries would be minor, this view rapidly changed. In France, the most recent reports of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths are as follows: through July 15, 2020, a total of 174 674 patients were diagnosed with confirmed cases, of whom 30 152 died due to COVID-19 and 79 244 recovered and were discharged from hospitals. Since March 15, 2020, some unprecedented measures have been adopted in France with the intention of controlling COVID-19 transmission and avoiding contact with others. As in many countries, officials with the French government have announced the closure of schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutions to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 by disrupting important chains of transmission.\nAccording to monitoring by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the closure of educational institutions impacted over 87% of the student population worldwide (De Oliveira et al.,). Students, as well as universities, became uncertain about how online teaching would be delivered, such as the procedures for assessments, projects and semester-end final examinations. This situation has created a sense of uncertainty, stress and anxiety that might lead to unfavourable outcomes regarding the psychological health of students. Several other measures were also implemented, including travel restrictions, social distancing, and closures of restaurants, movie theatres, gyms, museums, and other places involving potential gatherings, leading students to protect themselves from any person-to-person contact and to live in self-isolation until the situation became normal. Based on a number of recent studies, students have been identified as a vulnerable group that experiences significant levels of stress-related mental health concerns, including anxiety and depression. Thus, before the pandemic started, one in five college students worldwide had experienced one or more diagnosable mental disorders (; Zhai et al.,). According to previous research, individuals experience negative emotional responses, such as anxiety and depression symptoms, during an outbreak, and stressful events and public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 outbreak are potent adverse environmental factors that may exert greater psychological effects on students that are expressed as anxiety, fear and worry [; Fiorillo et al.,). A recent study among Chinese college students revealed that 24.9% experienced anxiety because of this COVID-19 outbreak. Overall, living in urban areas, living with parents and having a steady family income were identified as protective factors against anxiety in college students, while having a relative or an acquaintance infected with COVID-19 was an independent risk factor for experienced anxiety. Similarly, a study reported increased scores for anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts, worsened quality of life and decreased quality of sleep among Greek students during the lockdown.\nBased on this recent literature on the psychological impacts of the epidemic among students and because the Grand Est region was one of the three French regions that was most severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, the students from this area may be at particular risk of developing severe mental health issues. Thus, to evaluate their mental health and to understand student needs in order to develop interventions, this study aimed to assess the prevalence rate of anxiety and determine which sociodemographic, living conditions and health status characteristics could predict anxiety among French students during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nMethods\nStudy design and population\nThis study is a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Feelings and Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 epidemic among Students in the Grand Est area (PIMS-CoV19) study, an observational study that was conducted through an online survey. The online questionnaire was accessible from May 7 to May 17, 2020 and each participant had the opportunity to complete it only once. Twenty minutes were required to complete the survey. A sample of students was recruited from the University of Lorraine and the Sciences Po College located in Nancy, Lorraine, Grand Est region, France. The Grand Est Region was an area that ranked among the French regions that was most substantially affected by COVID-19 in terms of the incidence of COVID-19 cases, with 19.6 cases per 100 000 inhabitants during the period of the survey.\nAll students received detailed information regarding the purpose of the study and provided online informed consent to participate in the study. The survey was completed anonymously to ensure the confidentiality and reliability of the data. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\nWhen the study was launched, it targeted the entire student population in Lorraine, i.e. more than 50 000 students. We had estimated that 5-10% of the students would respond to the survey, i.e., between 2 500 and 5 000 students. No prior sample size calculation was performed.\nData collection\nThe survey consisted of three sections: questions regarding sociodemographic data and living conditions during the lockdown, concerns regarding the threat to health posed by COVID-19 and control measures, and health status measures assessed with self-administered questionnaires. All data were obtained at the time of the online survey.\nAnxiety symptoms\nThe 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was used to assess anxiety symptoms. It includes seven items based on seven core symptoms, and the participants were asked how often they were bothered by each symptom during the last two weeks. Each item was rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 &quot;not at all&quot; to 3 &quot;nearly every day&quot; such that the total score ranged from 0 to 21. It is currently the most widely used anxiety measure, both in clinical practice and research. The scores for symptom severity were 5-9 for mild anxiety, 10-14 for moderate anxiety, and 15-21 for severe anxiety. The French version of the GAD-7 was used, as it has yielded valid clinical assessments of anxiety. A good internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.898 was previously established, and good external validity has been confirmed. The scale has been used in many studies to assess anxiety symptoms in students.\nSelf-perceived social support\nThe 12-item Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) was used to assess social support from three sources: family, friends and significant others. The students were asked to indicate their level of agreement with each item on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 &quot;very strongly disagree&quot; to 7 &quot;very strongly agree.&quot; The total score of each dimension and the total scored range from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating higher perceived social support. The French version of the MSPSS has proven to have good psychometric properties. Good internal reliability and reproducibility were previously established. The original version yields valid clinical assessments of perceived social support among students.\nSociodemographic data and other characteristics\nThe students self-reported their demographic characteristics, including age, gender, living arrangements, home location and academic demographic information, such as academic programme and scholarship status. They were also asked about their living and learning conditions, changes in their consumption of psychoactive substances, their preventive behaviours regarding COVID-19 and the presence of a relative or acquaintance infected with COVID-19.\nStatistical analyses\nDescriptive analyses\nContinuous variables were described by the mean and standard deviation or the median, as appropriate, and categorical variables by percentages.\nBivariate and multivariate analyses\nA logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the variables associated with moderate to severe anxiety. The probability modelled was a GAD-7 score higher than 10. Sociodemographic characteristics, learning and teaching conditions, the influence of living conditions, concerns regarding the health threat posed by COVID-19 and self-perceived social support scores were investigated. Relevant factors were identified as factors that were associated in the bivariate analysis at the 10% threshold. The suitability of the full model was evaluated and compared with a model to which a stepwise selection of candidate variables was applied using a significance level entry of 0.1 and a significance level stay of 0.05. The goodness of fit was assessed by calculting the model determination coefficient (R2), and the Hosmer and Lemeshow test allowed the comparison and selection of the best multivariable model. Only significant factors at the 5% threshold in the level models were retained for multivariable analyses. Analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 software (SAS Inst., Cary, NC, USA).\nResults\nStudent characteristics\nSociodemographic and living characteristics of the study sample during the lockdown (N = 3936)\nTable 1	 	\n	Full sample	 		N	%/mean (SD)	 	Characteristic			 	Age	3928	21.7 (4.0)	 	Gender			 	Male	1154	29.4	 	Female	2771	70.6	 	Living arrangements			 	Alone	544	13.8	 	With spouse only	477	12.1	 	With parents	2576	65.5	 	With spouse and children	99	2.5	 	With friends	189	4.8	 	Others	45	1.3	 	Financial aid programme			 	None	2334	59.3	 	Scholarship	1602	40.7	 	Home location			 	Urban area	2318	59.3	 	Rural area	1590	40.7	 	Access to a private outside space			 	No access	671	17.1	 	Private balcony, courtyard or terrace	607	15.5	 	Private domestic garden	2353	60.1	 	Courtyard or garden for collective use	285	7.3	 	Difficulty isolating at home			 	Yes	987	25.1	 	No	2949	74.9	 	Tensions and conflicts at home			 	Yes	1115	28.3	 	No	2821	71.7	 	Noises outside the housing			 	Yes	920	23.4	 	No	3016	76.6	 	Noises inside the housing			 	Yes	783	19.9	 	No	3153	80.1	 	Student part-time job			 	None	2741	69.6	 	Activity interrupted during the lockdown	565	14.4	 	Activity increased during the lockdown	304	7.7	 	No change during the lockdown	326	8.3	 	Someone at home infected with COVID-19			 	No	3322	84.4	 	Confirmed and hospitalized cases	27	0.7	 	Confirmed and non-hospitalized cases	142	3.6	 	Suspected cases	445	11.3	 	Relative or acquaintance infected with COVID-19			 	No	1951	49.5	 	Confirmed and hospitalized cases	472	12.0	 	Confirmed and non-hospitalized cases	884	22.5	 	Suspected cases	629	16.0	 	\nAbbreviation: SD, standard deviation\nAs shown in Table 1 , 3 936 students were recruited in the PIMS-CoV19 study, more than two-thirds of whom were women (70.6%). The mean and median ages were 21.7 (SD=4) and 21 years old, respectively. Among the sample, 67.5% of students lived with their parents, while 18.7% lived alone and 7.7% lived in colocation during the lockdown. More than half lived (59.3%) in urban areas, and 60.1% had a domestic garden that provided the opportunity for students to have immediate outside contact. One-quarter of the students (28.3%) experienced conflicts within the housing where they were confined, and 25.1% found it difficult to isolate themselves in the dwelling. The largest group of participants were students of the faculties of sciences, including sport sciences, science and technology and medical sciences (57.9%), followed by students in the faculties of law, economy and management (14.1%). Due to disruptions in the academic routine, one-third of the students (36.2%) received total online teaching. The time working at home did not change for 29.2% of the students. For 13.4% of the students, the pandemic had a serious impact due to the postponement of a final examination. Of the 3 936 students, 40.7% received a financial aid programme as scholarship students and 14.4% had their student part-time job end during the lockdown, in addition to their interrupted studies. One-third of the participants (34.5%) had a relative or acquaintance who was infected with COVID-19, and 4.3% had someone in their housing infected with COVID-19.\nStudent behaviours\nLearning conditions and lifestyles of the study sample during the lockdown\nTable 2	 	\n	Full sample	 		N = 3936	 		N	%	 	Learning conditions			 	Academic programme			 	Sport, medical sciences, science and technology	2278	57.9	 	Law, economics, management	688	17.5	 	Arts, humanities, languages	337	8.6	 	Social and human sciences	630	16.0	 	Online teaching delivery			 	None	811	20.6	 	Partial online teaching	1701	43.2	 	Total online teaching	1424	36.2	 	Time working at home			 	No change	1148	29.2	 	Increased time working	787	20.0	 	Reduced time working	2001	50.8	 	Postponement of final examination (Yes)	529	13.4	 	Lifestyles			 	Alcohol consumption			 	None	1346	34.2	 	No change	672	17.1	 	Increased consumption	539	13.7	 	Reduced consumption	1378	35.0	 	Tobacco consumption			 	None	3283	83.5	 	No change	117	3.0	 	Increased consumption	282	7.2	 	Reduced consumption	252	6.3	 	Preventive behaviours at home regarding COVID-19			 	None	3332	84.7	 	Yes	604	15.3	 	\nMeans used by students to mitigate anxiety during the COVID-19 lockdown\nTable 3	 	\nOption	Not used	Ineffective1	2	3	4	Very effective5	 	Media entertainment, %	2.0	5.9	11.2	22.0	26.3	32.6	 	Reading entertainment, %	22.7	5.3	13.9	18.7	20.5	18.8	 	Physical exercise, %	17.0	5.1	10.8	16.5	20.3	30.3	 	Snacking between meals, %	24.1	11.7	19.5	18.8	13.7	12.2	 	\nAs shown in Table 2 , seventeen percent of the students (17.7%) reported consuming drinks two or more times per week before the lockdown. Under the lockdown, thirteen percent (13.7%) reported consuming more alcohol and 35% reported consuming less alcohol. Tobacco use increased for 7.2% of the students. More than three-quarters of the students (84.7%) adopted daily preventive behaviours regarding COVID-19 in their housing location. As shown in Table 3 , media entertainment was largely successfully used by students rather than physical exercise and reading as a means to relieve their distress and address their concerns regarding the negative conditions they were experiencing.\nLevels of anxiety and social support during the lockdown\nAnxiety and social support scores during the lockdown\nTable 4	 	\n	Full sample	 		N = 3936	 		N	%/Mean (SD)	 	GAD-7 score			 	Normal (0-4)	1533	38.9	 	Mild anxiety (5-9)	1418	36.0	 	Moderate anxiety (10-14)	598	15.2	 	Severe anxiety (15-21)	387	9.8	 	MSPSS-total score	3869	5.5 (1.1)	 	MSPSS-subscales			 	Family	3869	5.2 (1.5)	 	Friend	3869	5.5 (1.3)	 	Significant other	3869	5.7 (1.3)	 	\nAbbreviation: SD, standard deviation; GAD-7, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder\nScale; MSPSS, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support\nThe GAD-7 results are presented in Table 4 . The mean GAD-7 score was 6.7 (SD=5.0). The rate of mild anxiety was 36%, and the rates of moderate and severe anxiety were 15.2% and 9.8%, respectively.

Among the sociodemographic variables, female gender was a risk factor for anxiety symptoms (OR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.8-2.7, p&lt;0.0001). Regarding academic programmes, being engaged in arts, humanities, and languages was a risk factor for anxiety (OR=1.8, 95% CI: 1.4-2.4, p=0.0004). Among the learning conditions, the delay of final examinations (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.1, p&lt;0.0001) and the reduced time for learning due to academic disruption (OR=1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6, p=0.031) were found to be risk factors for anxiety symptoms. In terms of living conditions during the lockdown, the results indicated that many factors were associated with anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis: tensions and conflicts with family or occupants of the dwelling (OR=1.8, 95% CI: 1.5-2.1, p&lt;0.0001), difficulties in being able to isolate in the housing location (OR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6, p=0.0015), indoor noise in the housing location (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-1.9, p&lt;0.0001), noise outside the housing location (OR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.3-1.8, p&lt;0.0001) and no private direct access to outside through a garden, a terrace or a balcony (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.0, p=0.0006). In terms of student behaviours, increased tobacco consumption was a risk factor for anxiety symptoms (OR=1.9 95% CI: 1.4-2.6, p=0.0002). The self-perceived ineffectiveness of both media entertainment (OR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.1-4.4, p=0.0006) and reading (OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.7, p&lt;0.0001) to calm down were risk factors for anxiety. However, when reading was perceived as an effective means to calm down, it was a protective factor against anxiety (OR=0.7, 95% CI: 0.6-0.97, p&lt;0.0001). Regarding snacking, the greater the extent snacking was perceived as an effective means to calm down, the higher the risk of anxiety symptoms (OR=1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.5, p=0.0002). Family support (OR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.80-0.90, p&lt;0.0001) and friend support (OR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.82-0.94, p&lt;0.0001) were protective factors against anxiety symptoms. Having someone in their housing affected by COVID-19 was the highest risk factor for anxiety symptoms (OR=3.3, 95% CI: 1.4-7.9, p=0.0006).\nDiscussion\nImportant to the primary aim of this study was the finding that 61% of students in the sample experienced anxiety during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. This result is well above the value of 24.9% of Chinese students from Changzhi Medical College who were afflicted with experienced anxiety and the 22.1% of medical students enrolled at Tongji Medical College who experienced anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak quarantine period (Liu J et al.,). Based on our results, the psychological impact of the disease on the student population in a French area that was particularly affected by COVID-19 is significant. This high prevalence might be explained by an online assessment during a period when the period of isolation had lasted for more than one month and was prolonged by the government. In addition to the high infectivity and French mortality rate of COVID-19 relayed daily by the French media, the consequences of the prolongation of isolation in their homes might induce more anxiety among the students. This result highlights the students' perceptions of the serious threat at the peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and seriously contrasts with the low anxiety levels in the French population during the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. The results of this study also indicated that several characteristics were associated with students' moderate to severe anxiety. Among the sociodemographic characteristics, female gender was associated with a higher level of anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak, which differed from a previous study indicating that male and female students experienced similar levels of stress and negative emotions as a result of the epidemic. However, our result was consistent with a previous study conducted during the epidemic reporting that female gender was the highest risk factor for anxiety among Chinese high school students. The delay of a final examination and being in the arts, humanities and languages academic programmes were also significant factors contributing to students' experienced anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis. This result might be explained by the difficulties associated with teaching some courses, such as fine arts, art, and music, online, as previously suggested, and supports the need for a method by which students receive regular information about competitions, exams or assessment deadlines through university intranets during the outbreak. Furthermore, several characteristics of the students' living conditions were associated with student anxiety. In contrast to previous findings, students living in rural areas were not more likely to be anxious, but students without private outside access (terrace, garden, or balcony) were more likely to be anxious. Nevertheless, the lack of private direct outside access through a terrace or a balcony might be explained by the economic resources of the students. Although many of them made a lifestyle change during the lockdown by returning to their home with their parents, living with parents was not found to be a significant factor contributing to reduced anxiety, as previously reported. Regardless of the place of residence, conflicts at home, difficulties isolating themselves and noisy environments added to students' anxiety. Similarly, students using self-perceived inefficient strategies to calm down were most likely to be anxious. These environmental factors highlighted by this study support the need to develop behavioural strategies that focus on relaxation exercises and activity scheduling (home-based exercises) to counteract anxiety in the home environment. Consistent with previous findings, social support reduced psychological pressure and appeared to be a protective factor against anxiety, as anxiety disorders are known to be more likely to occur in the absence of interpersonal communication. Increased cigarette smoking was associated with students' anxiety symptoms. The factors underlying this association are still being discussed with two types of hypotheses. One is that anxious individuals are at an elevated risk of smoking due to the presumed calming effects of smoking (Kassel et al.,). Another is that cigarette smoking contributes to the development of anxiety disorders due to factors such as the presumed anxiogenic effects of nicotine. However, the results of a prospective study have shown that cigarette smoking might increase the risk of anxiety disorders during late adolescence and early adulthood. As expected, because it has been noted as an important variable in the literature, having relatives or acquaintances at home who are infected with COVID-19 and subsequently hospitalized were clearly the main risk factors for increasing the anxiety of the students, which might be related to the high contagiousness of the disease (WHO, 2020). Based on this result, effective and robust support is necessary for the family or indivdiduals in a close environment with an infected person during public health emergencies. It contributes to evidence that social support and psychological interventions are needed to decrease the anxiety of students when a relative is infected and hospitalized with COVID-19.\nThe results from this study should be interpreted in light of a number of strengths and limitations. First, the representativeness of the sample is limited, as it is a sample of voluntary participants, which may have led to an over-evaluation of anxiety. Second, the greater proportion of female students may have limited the representativeness. Third, the students were recruited from one of the French areas that was the most substantially affected by COVID-19, thereby limiting the generalizability of these results to all students. Fourth, the data were collected using electronic self-report questionnaires, which may have excluded persons without internet access and which, although anonymous, may introduce bias-specific to socially desirable responses. Finally, despite the large number of determinants included in the analyses, the multivariate model explained 25% of the explained variance; thus, other factors, such as anxiety due to media coverage and daily accurate information regarding the infection rates and number of deaths, were not accounted for by our study and should be included in future studies. However, this study provides invaluable information on the anxiety of students in a French area particularly affected by COVID-19. Our results bring attention to the interesting findings that health initiatives for students should include improvements in learning and living environments. Simply developing resources to facilitate online guidance and lectures to offer strategies for managing anxiety and building a campus environment that offers access to a private outside space for the students are essential, as these actions might result in mental health benefits.\nBased on the findings of the present study, more than half of the students in a French area particularly affected by COVID-19 experienced anxiety during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Although the virus continues to circulate, the epidemic is under control in France. However, it is still spreading elsewhere, and recommendations are needed in preparation for a possible second wave. The female gender, having a relative or an acquaintance at home infected with COVID-19 and some living conditions were the main factors associated with higher levels of anxiety. Several key messages should be highlighted based on these findings. First, the government should focus more on psychological health among students while combating COVID-19. Then, the results provide some novel information that identifies high-risk groups among students and promotes specific and effective interventions aimed at this particular group, thus providing potential psychological benefits.\nPatient and public involvement\nAll students received detailed information describing the purpose of the study and provided online informed consent to participate in the study.

that occur frequently in the media to be more serious, and have higher disease status than those that infrequently occur in the media, even when the low media frequency conditions were considered objectively worse by a separate group of participants.\n Estimates of severity also positively correlated with popular print media frequency in both student populations.\n However, we also see that

(suicidal thoughts and behaviors) are common among university students, the majority of students with these problems remain untreated.\n\n It is unclear what the barriers are to these students seeking treatment.\n\n\nAims\nThe aim of this study is to examine the barriers to future help?seeking and the associations of clinical characteristics with these barriers in a cross?national sample of first?year college students.\n\n\nMethod\nAs part of the World Mental Health International College Student (WMH?ICS) initiative, web?based self?report surveys were obtained from 13,984 first?year students in eight countries across the world.\n\n Clinical characteristics examined included screens for common mental disorders and reports about suicidal thoughts and behaviors.\n\n Multivariate regression models adjusted for socio?demographic, college?, and treatment?related variables were used to examine correlates of help?seeking intention and barriers to seeking treatment.\n\n\nResults\nOnly 24.6% of students reported that they would definitely seek treatment if they had a future emotional problem.\n\n The most commonly reported reasons not to seek treatment among students who failed to report that they would definitely seek help were the preference to handle the problem alone (56.4%) and wanting to talk with friends or relatives instead (48.0%).\n\n Preference to handle the problem alone and feeling too embarrassed were also associated with significantly reduced odds of having at least some intention to seek help among students who failed to report that they would definitely seek help.\n\n Having 12?month major depression, alcohol use disorder, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors were also associated with significantly reduced reported odds of the latter outcome.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe majority of first?year college students in the WMH?ICS surveys report that they would be hesitant to seek help in case of future emotional problems.\n\n Attitudinal barriers and not structural barriers were found to be the most important reported reasons for this hesitation.\n\n Experimental research is needed to determine whether intention to seek help and, more importantly, actual help?seeking behavior could be increased with the extent to which intervention strategies need to be tailored to particular student characteristics.\n\n Given that the preference to handle problems alone and stigma and appear to be critical, there could be value in determining if internet?based psychological treatments, which can be accessed privately and are often build as self?help approaches, would be more acceptable than other types of treatments to student who report hesitation about seeking treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6522323","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"David

not receive professional help.\n\n Internet-based self-help formats may increase the utilization of treatment.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based, app-supported stress management intervention for college students.\n\n\nMethods\nCollege students (n=150) with elevated levels of stress (Perceived Stress Scale 4-item version, PSS-4 ?8) were randomly assigned to either an internet- and mobile-based stress intervention group with feedback on demand or a waitlist control group.\n\n Self-report data were assessed at baseline, posttreatment (7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up.\n\n The primary outcome was perceived stress posttreatment (PSS-4).\n\n Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and college-related outcomes.\n\n Subgroup analyses were conducted in students with clinically relevant symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale &gt;17).\n\n\nResults\nA total of 106 participants (76.8%) indicated that they were first-time help-seekers, and 77.3% (intervention group: 58/75; waitlist control group: 58/75) showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline.\n\n Findings indicated significant effects of the intervention compared with the waitlist control group for stress (d=0.69; 95% CI 0.36-1.02), anxiety (d=0.76; 95% CI 0.43-1.09), depression (d=0.63; 95% CI 0.30-0.96), college-related productivity (d=0.33; 95% CI 0.01-0.65), academic work impairment (d=0.34; 95% CI 0.01-0.66), and other outcomes after 7 weeks (posttreatment).\n\n Response rates for stress symptoms were significantly higher for the intervention group (69%, 52/75) compared with the waitlist control group (35%, 26/75, P&lt;.\n\n001; number needed to treat=2.89, 95% CI 2.01-5.08) at posttest (7 weeks).\n\n Effects were sustained at 3-month follow-up, and similar findings emerged in students with symptoms of depression.\n\n\nConclusions\nInternet- and mobile-based interventions could be an effective and cost-effective approach to reduce consequences of college-related stress and might potentially attract students with clinically relevant depression who would not otherwise seek help.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nGerman Clinical Trial Register DRKS00010212;

investigating an alternative method to understanding coping and adjustment","abstract":"Researchers recently have suggested that coping flexibility (i.\ne.\n, an individuals ability to modify and change coping strategies depending on the context) may be an important way to investigate coping.\n The availability of numerous coping strategies may be an important precursor to coping flexibility, given that flexibility can only be obtained if an individual is able to access and use different coping strategies.\n Typically, studies examining the use of coping strategies compute means-based analyses, which assess not only what strategies are used but also how much they are used.\n Thus, there is limited ability to differentiate between individuals who use a lot of strategies infrequently, and individuals who use only one or two strategies a lot.\n One way to address this confound is to count the number of strategies that an individual uses without attention to how frequently they use them (i.\ne.\n, a count-based approach).\n The present longitudinal study compares a count-based model and a means-based model of coping and adjustment among undergraduates (N = 1132).\n An autoregressive cross-lagged path analysis revealed that for the count-based approach, using a greater number of positive coping strategies led to more positive adjustment and less suicide ideation over time than using a smaller number of positive coping strategies.\n Further, engagement in a greater number of negative coping strategies predicted more depressive symptoms and poorer emotion regulation over time.\n In comparison, the means-based model revealed identical results for negative coping strategies; however, engagement in more frequent positive coping strategies did not predict better positive adjustment over time.\n Thus, a count-based approach offers a novel way to examine how the number of coping strategies that individuals use can help promote adjustment among university students.\n","id":"PMC5642021","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

disorders.\n\n Poor mental health is associated with low academic attainment, physical, interpersonal and cognitive impairments.\n\n Universities can use online approaches to screen students for mental disorders and treat those in need.\n\n The present study aims to assess the effectiveness of a guided web-based transdiagnostic individually tailored intervention to treat students with symptoms of depression and/or anxiety.\n\n\nMethods and analysis\n\nThe present study is a randomised controlled trial.\n\n Participants are Dutch college students (?18 years) with mild to moderate depression and/or anxiety symptoms.\n\n The intervention is a guided web-based transdiagnostic individually tailored intervention that targets symptoms of depression and/or?anxiety.\n\n The intervention consists of seven online sessions with a duration ranging from 4 to 7 weeks depending on individual progress.\n\n A booster session is administered 4?weeks after the completion of the seventh session.\n\n Primary outcome measures are the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale for anxiety.\n\n These scales are administered at screening, post-treatment and follow-up assessments (6 and 12 months post-randomisation).\n\n\n\nEthics and dissemination\nThe Medical Ethics Committee of the Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre has approved the protocol (registration number 2016.583, A2017.362andA2018.421).\n\n Results of the trial will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\n\nTrial registration number\nNTR6797;

Coping Circumplex Model: An Integrative Model of the Structure of Coping With Stress","abstract":"It seems obvious that the identification of coping structure is necessary to understand how stress affects human health and functioning.\n Despite numerous coping conceptualization proposals, there is no agreement as to the core coping categories.\n This article presents the Coping Circumplex Model (CCM), which is designed to integrate various coping distinctions, drawing inspiration from the tradition of circumplex models in psychology.\n The model is based on the assumption that individuals in stressful situations face two tasks: they need to solve the problem and regulate their emotions, which are reflected in two corresponding dimensions, that is, the problem coping dimension and emotion coping dimension.\n Problem coping and emotion coping are interpreted as bipolar dimensions.\n Importantly, these dimensions define a space for other coping categories.\n The model contains a total of eight coping styles forming a circumplex: positive emotional coping, efficiency, problem solving, preoccupation with the problem, negative emotional coping, helplessness, problem avoidance, and hedonic disengagement.\n The paper discusses the potential of the CCM to overcome some of the problems of stress psychology by: (a) supplementing the set of coping categories (i.\ne.\n, process, strategy, style) with coping mode; (b) providing a foundation for the integration of numerous coping constructs; (c) enabling the interpretation of results obtained by means of different coping measures, thus facilitating knowledge consolidation; (d) explaining relationships between coping and adjustment after trauma, as well as explaining the mechanisms of psychological interventions (e.\ng.\n, cognitive therapy, exposure therapy); (e) clarifying linkages between the effectiveness of coping strategies and situation controllability.\n Moreover, the CCM may elucidate the relationship between coping and emotion regulation (e.\ng.\n, cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression).\n","id":"PMC6476932","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

Review","abstract":"Background\nMental disorders are responsible for a high level of disability burden in students attending university.\n\n However, many universities have limited resources available to support student mental health.\n\n Technology-based interventions may be highly relevant to university populations.\n\n Previous reviews have targeted substance use and eating disorders in tertiary students.\n\n However, the effectiveness of technology-based interventions for other mental disorders and related issues has not been reviewed.\n\n\nObjective\nTo systematically review published randomized trials of technology-based interventions evaluated in a university setting for disorders other than substance use and eating disorders.\n\n\nMethods\nThe PubMed, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched using keywords, phrases, and MeSH terms.\n\n Retrieved abstracts (n=1618) were double screened and coded.\n\n Included studies met the following criteria: (1) the study was a randomized trial or a randomized controlled trial, (2) the sample was composed of students attending a tertiary institution, (3) the intervention was delivered by or accessed using a technological device or process, (4) the age range of the sample was between 18 and 25 years, and (5) the intervention was designed to improve, reduce, or change symptoms relating to a mental disorder.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 27 studies met inclusion criteria for the present review.\n\n Most of the studies (24/27, 89%) employed interventions targeting anxiety symptoms or disorders or stress, although almost one-third (7/24, 29%) targeted both depression and anxiety.\n\n There were a total of 51 technology-based interventions employed across the 27 studies.\n\n Overall, approximately half (24/51, 47%) were associated with at least 1 significant positive outcome compared with the control at postintervention.\n\n However, 29% (15/51) failed to find a significant effect.\n\n Effect sizes were calculated for the 18 of 51 interventions that provided sufficient data.\n\n Median effect size was 0.54 (range 0.07 to 3.04) for 8 interventions targeting depression and anxiety symptoms and 0.84 (range 0.07 to 2.66) for 10 interventions targeting anxiety symptoms and disorders.\n\n Internet-based technology (typically involving cognitive behavioral therapy) was the most commonly employed medium, being employed in 16 of 27 studies and approximately half of the 51 technology-based interventions (25/51, 49%).\n\n Distal and universal preventive interventions were the most common type of intervention.\n\n Some methodological problems were evident in the studies, with randomization methods either inadequate or inadequately described, few studies specifying a primary outcome, and most of the studies failing to undertake or report appropriate intent-to-treat analyses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe findings of this review indicate that although technological interventions targeting certain mental health and related problems offer promise for students in university settings, more high quality trials that fully report randomization methods, outcome data, and data analysis methods are needed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3668609","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR Publications

With Panic Attacks: Randomized Controlled Trial","abstract":"Background\nPrevious studies on Internet-based treatment with minimal therapist guidance have shown promising results for several specific diagnoses.\n\n\nObjective\nTo (1) investigate the effects of a tailored, therapist-guided, Internet-based treatment for individuals with reoccurring panic attacks, and (2) to examine whether people in different age groups (1830 years and 3145 years) would respond differently to the treatment.\n\n\nMethods\nWe recruited 149 participants from an online list of individuals having expressed an interest in Internet treatment.\n\n Screening consisted of online questionnaires followed by a telephone interview.\n\n A total of 57 participants were included after a semistructured diagnostic interview, and they were randomly assigned to an 8-week treatment program (n = 29) or to a control condition (n = 28).\n\n Treatment consisted of individually prescribed cognitive behavior therapy text modules in conjunction with online therapist guidance.\n\n The control group consisted of people on a waitlist who later received treatment.\n\n\nResults\nAll dependent measures improved significantly immediately following treatment and at the 12-month follow-up.\n\n The between-group effect size on the primary outcome measure, the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, was d = 1.41 (95%

and mobile-based indicated transdiagnostic prevention of depression and anxiety (ICare Prevent): A three-armed randomized controlled trial in four European countries","abstract":"Background\nDepression and anxiety are highly prevalent and often co-occur.\n\n Several studies indicate the potential of disorder-specific psychological interventions for the prevention of each of these disorders.\n\n To treat comorbidity, transdiagnostic treatment concepts seem to be a promising approach, however, evidence for transdiagnostic concepts of prevention remains inconclusive.\n\n Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) may be an effective means to deliver psychological interventions on a large scale for the prevention of common mental disorders (CMDs) such as depression and anxiety.\n\n IMIs have been shown to be effective in treating CMDs, e.\n\ng.\n\n in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\n However, there is a lack of studies examining the efficacy of interventions reducing the incidence of CMDs.\n\n Moreover, the comparative cost-effectiveness of guided versus unguided IMIs for the prevention of depression and anxiety has not been studied yet.\n\n Hence, this study aims at investigating the (cost-) effectiveness of guided and unguided internet- and mobile-based transdiagnostic individually tailored indicated prevention of depression and anxiety.\n\n\nMethods\nA multi-country three-armed randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare a guided and unguided intervention to treatment as usual (TAU).\n\n Both active conditions are based on the same intervention, ICare Prevent, and differ only with regard to guidance format.\n\n Altogether, 954 individuals with subclinical symptoms of depression (CES-D???16) and anxiety (GAD-7???5) who do not have a full-blown disorder will be recruited in Germany, Switzerland, Spain and the Netherlands, and randomized to one of three conditions (guided intervention, unguided intervention, or TAU).\n\n The TAU arm will receive access to the training after a 12-month waiting period.\n\n The primary outcome will be time to CMD onset (any depression/anxiety disorder) within a follow-up period of 12?months after baseline.\n\n Secondary outcomes will include disorder-specific symptom severity (depression/anxiety) assessed by diagnostic raters blinded to intervention condition at post-intervention, self-reports, acceptability, health related quality of life, and psychosocial variables associated with developing a CMD.\n\n Assessments will take place at baseline, mid-intervention (5?weeks into the intervention), post-intervention (8?weeks after randomization) and follow-up (6 and 12?months after randomization).\n\n Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol.\n\n Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from a public health and a societal perspective, including both direct and indirect costs.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study will further enhance the evidence-base for transdiagnostic preventive interventions and provide valuable information about optimal trade-off between treatment outcome and costs.\n\n\nTrial registration\nGerman Clinical Trial Registration (DRKS - http://www.\n\ndrks.\n\nde/drks_web/):

Anxiety, and Psychological Well-Being of University Students: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","abstract":"Background\nDepression and anxiety are common mental health difficulties experienced by university students and can impair academic and social functioning.\n\n Students are limited in seeking help from professionals.\n\n As university students are highly connected to digital technologies, Web-based and computer-delivered interventions could be used to improve students mental health.\n\n The effectiveness of these intervention types requires investigation to identify whether these are viable prevention strategies for university students.\n\n\nObjective\nThe intent of the study was to systematically review and analyze trials of Web-based and computer-delivered interventions to improve depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and stress in university students.\n\n\nMethods\nSeveral databases were searched using keywords relating to higher education students, mental health, and eHealth interventions.\n\n The eligibility criteria for studies included in the review were: (1) the study aimed to improve symptoms relating to depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and stress, (2) the study involved computer-delivered or Web-based interventions accessed via computer, laptop, or tablet, (3) the study was a randomized controlled trial, and (4) the study was trialed on higher education students.\n\n Trials were reviewed and outcome data analyzed through random effects meta-analyses for each outcome and each type of trial arm comparison.\n\n Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to assess study quality.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 17 trials were identified, in which seven were the same three interventions on separate samples; 14 reported sufficient information for meta-analysis.\n\n The majority (n=13) were website-delivered and nine interventions were based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\n\n A total of 1795 participants were randomized and 1480 analyzed.\n\n Risk of bias was considered moderate, as many publications did not sufficiently report their methods and seven explicitly conducted completers analyses.\n\n In comparison to the inactive control, sensitivity meta-analyses supported intervention in improving anxiety (pooled standardized mean difference [SMD] ?0.56; 95% CI ?0.77 to ?0.35, P&lt;.\n\n001), depression (pooled SMD ?0.43; 95% CI ?0.63 to ?0.22, P&lt;.\n\n001), and stress (pooled SMD ?0.73; 95% CI ?1.27 to ?0.19, P=.\n\n008).\n\n In comparison to active controls, sensitivity analyses did not support either condition for anxiety (pooled SMD ?0.18; 95% CI ?0.98 to 0.62, P=.\n\n66) or depression (pooled SMD ?0.28; 95% CI ?0.75 to ?0.20, P=.\n\n25).\n\n In contrast to a comparison intervention, neither condition was supported in sensitivity analyses for anxiety (pooled SMD ?0.10; 95% CI ?0.39 to 0.18, P=.\n\n48) or depression (pooled SMD ?0.33; 95% CI ?0.43 to 1.09, P=.\n\n40).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe findings suggest Web-based and computer-delivered interventions can be effective in improving students depression, anxiety, and stress outcomes when compared to inactive controls, but some caution is needed when compared to other trial arms and methodological issues were noticeable.\n\n Interventions need to be trialed on more heterogeneous student samples and would benefit from user evaluation.\n\n Future trials should address methodological considerations to improve reporting of trial quality and address post-intervention skewed data.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4051748","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR Publications

An individual participant data meta-analysis","abstract":"Background\nLittle is known about potential harmful effects as a consequence of self-guided internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT), such as symptom deterioration rates.\n\n Thus, safety concerns remain and hamper the implementation of self-guided iCBT into clinical practice.\n\n We aimed to conduct an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of clinically significant deterioration (symptom worsening) in adults with depressive symptoms who received self-guided iCBT compared with control conditions.\n\n Several socio-demographic, clinical and study-level variables were tested as potential moderators of deterioration.\n\n\nMethods\nRandomised controlled trials that reported results of self-guided iCBT compared with control conditions in adults with symptoms of depression were selected.\n\n Mixed effects models with participants nested within studies were used to examine possible clinically significant deterioration rates.\n\n\nResults\nThirteen out of 16 eligible trials were included in the present IPD meta-analysis.\n\n Of the 3805 participants analysed, 7.2% showed clinically significant deterioration (5.8% and 9.1% of participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively).\n\n Participants in self-guided iCBT were less likely to deteriorate (OR 0.62, p &lt; 0.001) compared with control conditions.\n\n None of the examined participant- and study-level moderators were significantly associated with deterioration rates.\n\n\nConclusions\nSelf-guided iCBT has a lower rate of negative outcomes on symptoms than control conditions and could be a first step treatment approach for adult depression as well as an alternative to watchful waiting in general practice.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6190066","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cambridge University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Eirini","surname":"Karyotaki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lise","surname":"Kemmeren","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Heleen","surname":"Riper","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jos","surname":"Twisk","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Adriaan","surname":"Hoogendoorn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Annet","surname":"Kleiboer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Adriana","surname":"Mira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Mackinnon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Björn","surname":"Meyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cristina","surname":"Botella","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elizabeth","surname":"Littlewood","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gerhard","surname":"Andersson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Helen","surname":"Christensen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jan P.","surname":"Klein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Johanna","surname":"Schröder","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juana","surname":"Bretón-López","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Justine","surname":"Scheider","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Griffiths","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Louise","surname":"Farrer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marcus J.

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

China in the First Half of January 2020: A Data-Driven Modelling Analysis of the Early Outbreak","abstract":"Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth.\n The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation.\n We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for

single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25,

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from

resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and

reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

and Psychological Well-Being of Individuals in Times of a Major Air Pollution Crisis","abstract":"Background\nCrisis situations bring about many challenges to researchers, public institutions, and governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire.\n\n Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access.\n\n\nIn addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6).\n\n The total Impact of Event ScaleRevised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n The perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level and the number of physical symptoms were associated with higher IES-R Score (P&lt;.\n\n05).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis is one of the first few studies demonstrating the use of Internet in data collection during an air-pollution crisis.\n\n Our results demonstrated that the newer technological modalities have the potential to acquire data, similar to that of conventional technologies.\n\n Demographic variables did not influence the mechanism of usage.\n\n In addition, our findings also suggested that there are acute physical and psychological impacts on the population from an air-pollution crisis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4114481","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR Publications

agonist maintenance treatment (MMT) is used to treat opioid addiction by preventing opioid withdrawal and reducing cravings.\n\n However, it is important to note that mental conditions may persist, or even remain undetected while methadone maintenance treatment is ongoing.\n\n This study aimed to examine the level of psychological problems among MMT patients at public and private health facilities

infectious equine influenza.\n\n Government disease control measures were put in place to control, contain, and eradicate the disease; these measures included movement restrictions and quarantining of properties.\n\n This study was conducted to assess the psycho-social impacts of this disease, and this paper reports the prevalence of, and factors influencing, psychological distress during this outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nData were collected using an online survey, with a link directed to the affected population via a number of industry groups.\n\n Psychological distress, as determined by the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale, was the main outcome measure.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 2760 people participated in this study.\n\n Extremely high levels of non-specific psychological distress were reported by respondents in this study, with 34% reporting high psychological distress (K10 &gt; 22), compared to levels of around 12% in the Australian general population.\n\n Analysis, using backward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis, revealed that those living in high risk infection (red) zones (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.572.55; p &lt; 0.001) and disease buffer (amber) zones (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.362.46; p &lt; 0.001) were at much greater risk of high psychological distress than those living in uninfected (white zones).\n\n Although prevalence of high psychological distress was greater in infected EI zones and States, elevated levels of psychological distress were experienced in horse-owners nationally.\n\n Statistical analysis indicated that certain groups were more vulnerable to high psychological distress; specifically younger people, and those with lower levels of formal educational qualifications.\n\n Respondents whose principal source of income was from horse-related industry were more than twice as likely to have high psychological distress than those whose primary source of income was not linked to horse-related industry (OR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.822.73; p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nAlthough, methodologically, this study had good internal validity, it has limited generalisability because it was not possible to identify, bound, or sample the target population accurately.\n\n However, this study is the first to collect psychological distress data from an affected population during such a disease outbreak and has potential to inform those involved in assessing the potential psychological impacts of human infectious diseases, such as pandemic influenza.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2571100","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Melanie

investigated associations between psychological and behavioral indices throughout a major epidemic.\n\n This study was aimed to compare the strength of associations between different cognitive and affective measures of risk and self-reported protective behaviors in a series of ten cross-sectional surveys conducted throughout the first wave of influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.\n\n\nMethods\nAll surveys were conducted using questionnaire-based telephone interviews, with random digit dialing to recruit adults from the general population.\n\n Measures of anxiety and worry (affective) and perceived risk (cognitive) regarding A/H1N1 were made in 10 serial surveys.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the cognitive/affective-behavioral associations in each survey while multilevel logistic models were conducted to estimate the average effects of each cognitive/affective measure on adoption of protective behaviors throughout the ten surveys.\n\n\nResults\nExcepting state anxiety, other affective measures including anticipated worry, experienced worry and current worry specific to A/H1N1 risk were consistently and strongly associated with adoption of protective behaviors across different survey periods.\n\n However, the cognitive-behavioral associations were weaker and inconsistent across the ten surveys.\n\n Perceived A/H1N1 severity relative to SARS had stronger associations with adoption of protective behaviors in the late epidemic periods than in the early epidemic periods.\n\n\nConclusion\nRisk-specific worries appear to be significantly associated with the adoption of protective behaviors at different epidemic stages, whereas cognitive measures may become more important in understanding peoples behavioral responses later in epidemics.\n\n Future epidemic-related psycho-behavioral research should include more affective-loaded measures of risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3986671","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience.\n Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic.\n The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n The data will be used for future reference.\n Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques.\n The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 2024 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"China NHCotPsRo (2020) Guideline for psychological crisis intervention during 2019-nCoV. https://www.govcn/xinwen/2020-01/27/content_5472433htm.

depression.\n\n\nDesign\nIndividual participant data meta-analysis.\n\n\nData sources\nMedline, Medline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, and Web of Science (January 2000-February 2015).\n\n\nInclusion criteria\nEligible studies compared PHQ-9 scores with major depression diagnoses from validated diagnostic interviews.\n\n Primary study data and study level data extracted from primary reports were synthesized.\n\n For PHQ-9 cut-off scores 5-15, bivariate random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity, separately, among studies that used semistructured diagnostic interviews, which are designed for administration by clinicians; fully structured interviews, which are designed for lay administration; and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric (MINI) diagnostic interviews, a brief fully structured interview.\n\n Sensitivity and specificity were examined among participant subgroups and, separately, using meta-regression, considering all subgroup variables in a single model.\n\n\nResults\nData were obtained for 58 of 72 eligible studies (total n=17?357; major depression cases n=2312).\n\n Combined sensitivity and specificity was maximized at a cut-off score of 10 or above among studies using a semistructured interview (29 studies, 6725 participants; sensitivity 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.92; specificity 0.85, 0.82 to 0.88).\n\n Across cut-off scores 5-15, sensitivity with semistructured interviews was 5-22% higher than for fully structured interviews (MINI excluded; 14 studies, 7680 participants) and 2-15% higher than for the MINI (15 studies, 2952 participants).\n\n Specificity was similar across diagnostic interviews.\n\n The PHQ-9 seems to be similarly sensitive but may be less specific for younger patients than for older patients; a cut-off score of 10 or above can be used regardless of age.\n\n.\n\n\nConclusions\nPHQ-9 sensitivity compared with semistructured diagnostic interviews was greater than in previous conventional meta-analyses that combined reference standards.\n\n A cut-off score of 10 or above maximized combined sensitivity and specificity overall and for subgroups.\n\n\nRegistration\nPROSPERO CRD42014010673.\n","id":"PMC6454318","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group

our region, so we want to measure it and then try to improve our community.\n\n\nAim:\nWe aim to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among high school students at Qassim region.\n\n\nMethods:\nA cross-sectional study done in al-Qassim region.\n\n A targeted population was secondary school students.\n\n The sample size was 1245 students.\n\n We used the questionnaire tool the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression in the students and the GAD7 for anxiety.\n\n The data had been gathered through MS Excel then exported to the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) for analyses.\n\n A P value cut-off point of 0.05 at 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to determine statistical significance.\n\n The analyses measure the association between socio-demographic and other related variables in the survey by using a Chi-square test.\n\n\nResult:\nOur study shows that depression by using (PHQ-9) among the 1245 students, 325 (26.0%) were not depressed, 423 (34%) were mildly depressed, 306 (24.6%) were moderately depressed, whereas 129 (10.4%) were moderately severe depressed and 62 (5.0%) were severely depressed.\n\n Anxiety by using the GAD-7 questionnaire, it was revealed that out of 1245 students, 455 (36.5%) of them were without anxiety, 425 (34.1%) of them were having mild anxiety, 243 (19.5%) of them were having moderate anxiety and 122 (9.8%) were having severe anxiety.\n\n Depression and anxiety, according to gender (P value &lt;0.001), show a significant relationship.\n\n\nConclusion:\nWe have to raise the awareness of the mental health in our community as the prevalence of mental disorder has significantly increased over time.\n\n Health services should make health education for students on how they deal with stress and depression through exercise and good sleep.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6436297","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Medknow Publications &amp; Media Pvt

download applications in various application stores.\n\n Smartphone applications have been proven to be useful for youths in various aspects.\n\n However, there has been a paucity of data looking into the preferences of Vietnamese youths and adolescents with regards to health-related applications and their receptiveness towards smartphone apps.\n\n Therefore, this study aimed to determine the receptiveness and preferences of health-related smartphone applications (mHealth apps) among online Vietnamese youths and adolescents.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>An online cross-sectional study was conducted between the periods of August till October 2015 in Vietnam.\n\n Respondent-driven sampling technique (RDS) was utilized to recruit participants.\n\n Participants were asked questions about their history of downloading and using health-related smartphone applications and their receptiveness when using these applications.\n\n Moreover, socio-demographic characteristics and health status were also self-reported.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression was employed to determine associated factors.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Among 1028 participants, 57.4% owned a smartphone and only 14.1% of smartphone users have used a health-related smartphone application, and most of these individuals downloaded the applications for disease prevention (66.3%).\n\n 66.4% of the participants who owned these applications reported that health applications were useful and 92.8% reported being satisfied with the functionalities of the applications which they owned.\n\n Among smartphone users, people who were employed (OR?=?15.46; 95%CI?=?4.9348.47) were more likely to download mHealth apps.\n\n Meanwhile, youths with higher EQ-5D index had a lower likelihood of downloading healthcare-related

high acceptance of individuals who already used these apps.\n\n Developing mHealth apps or interventions towards the disease prevention and quality of life improvement could be feasible to proliferate the benefits of such applications in youths and adolescents in Vietnam.\n\n Further research should be conducted to optimize the contents and interfaces of mHealth apps that meet the needs of these

As of 2 April 2020, the number of confirmed cases worldwide has exceeded 1000,000 and the global situation is of the utmost seriousness. The Chinese government has implemented strict self- and forced-quarantine measures across the country. Under the unified deployment of the education department, the return of students to colleges has been postponed in most provinces. More than one million college students in Guangdong Province are currently studying online at home.\nIn any biological disaster, the themes of depression, uncertainty, and fear are common. A study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China found that 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the pandemic as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Prolonged lockdown had several adverse impacts on mental health. In a survey, respondents aged 12-21.4 years showed a higher psychological impact four weeks later than that on the onset of COVID-19. This age group mainly comprised of students who were undergoing prolonged school suspensions, requiring online education support and uncertainty about examinations and enrollment arrangements. Furthermore, people with preexisting psychiatric illnesses had difficulty accessing mental health services during the lockdown. Strict self-quarantine measures may also affect college students with mental health problems. We need a larger epidemiological survey evaluating the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on college students.\nDuring the pandemic, the regular holiday activities of college students are limited as they have lost the freedom to go out and socialize face-to-face as they would usually. This kind of loss can be overwhelming, and students who lack an appropriate coping style may experience depression. Furthermore, some college students may experience irregularities in their daily life, such as getting up late, staying up late, spending more time surfing the Internet, and so on. All of these may lead to disruption to their biological rhythms, known to be an important clinical feature and pathophysiological mechanism underlying mental illness, closely related to the onset, symptoms and social functions of depression. Quarantine for COVID-19 increases the possibility of psychological and mental health problems, and depression is more likely to occur and worsen as a result. Simultaneously, the reduction of activity caused by quarantine can lead to a vicious circle in which ways to alleviate negative emotions are reduced. Compared with the SARS pandemic in 2003 and the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, Internet services are more widely available. Activity on various network platforms among college students is high, and there are many available approaches to obtaining information. A nationwide survey revealed that young people tend to obtain a large amount of information from social media that can easily trigger stress. The length of time spent online to browse information about the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect emotional stability. Therefore, it is particularly important to evaluate the living rhythms and depressive symptoms of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result of the pandemic, colleges and universities have been prompted to conduct education online, and autonomous learning at home for college students may raise challenges relating to their self-discipline. Some students report that it is more difficult to persist with study at home than at school, and that students feel higher levels of self-negation and depression. If effective emotional regulation is absent, the risk of depression is likely to be increased. Previous studies have shown that regulatory emotional self-efficacy (RESE) could directly predict mental health, such as depression and anxiety. RESE refers to the degree of confidence with which individuals can effectively regulate their emotional state, which has two components: perceived self-efficacy in managing negative (NEG) and in expressing positive (POS) affect. In a longitudinal study on the relationship between RESE and depressive symptoms in a group of early adolescents, having strong RESE was not only negatively associated with their current levels of depression, but also predicted their depression after 4 years. People with weak RESE were more inclined to choose negative emotional regulation strategies to deal with negative emotions when distressed, leading them to experience worse depression. On the contrary, favorable RESE could help individuals use positive approaches to improve their emotion regulation. A study of graduate students found that RESE would serve as a buffering factor, decreasing the risk of suicide caused by depression. Therefore, it is of great significance to detect the RESE of college students during quarantine at home.\nTo date, there are few studies on the immediate psychological impact of COVID-19 on college students. Cao et al. examined the prevalence of anxiety among 7143 college students during the pandemic by using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and found that 3.6% of the respondents were experiencing moderate to severe anxiety (GAD-7 &gt;= 10). The implementation of the depressive symptoms assessment of college students is also an important part of dealing with the pandemic, and to inform the formulation and implementation of relevant mental health intervention policies. Therefore, we focused on the period of occurrence and development of COVID-19 to comprehensively evaluate the immediate psychological influence on college students by considering both negative symptomatology and positive efficacy. We also sought to determine the relationships between depressive symptoms, RESE and living rhythms, and predict the risk factors for mental health difficulties. It was intended that this work would provide a basis for the prevention of mental health difficulties in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMethods\nStudy population and design\nThis was a cross-sectional survey conducted among 85 colleges in Guangdong province in China between 13 and 22 February 2020. A contact person in each college was responsible for the distribution and collection of the questionnaires. College students in Guangdong province were able to access the survey using WeChat and answer the questionnaire anonymously by scanning the two-dimensional barcodes of the questionnaire address or clicking the relevant link. After participants entering the survey homepage, an online consent form would be displayed before the questionnaire. If the participants had no objection to survey objective in the consent form, they could officially start the survey by clicking &quot;Next&quot; button below, or they could have right to cease the survey. Only one response per person to the questionnaire was permitted. Participation was completely voluntary and non-commercial. In our study, the items of name and personal phone number were optional in the questionnaire. In addition, all investigators had signed confidentiality agreements. The senior investigators performed quality control by checking the collected questionnaires daily. The study was approved by the appropriate institutional research and ethics committee.\nIn total, 361,969 college students completed the questionnaire. Before data processing, we applied a series of strict participant exclusion criteria, namely: (1) If the major could not be identified or was filled in indiscriminately, (2) If the name of the school could not be identified or did not belong to Guangdong Province, (3) If there was an obvious discrepancy between the grade (level) of study and school academic system, (4) If all the living rhythms questions were responded in the same way. According to the above exclusion criteria, 89.4% (323,489/361,969) questionnaires were considered valid for inclusion in the analysis ultimately.\nMeasures\nDemographic variables included gender (male or female), age, grade, nationality, educational level (junior college or undergraduate college), family residence, and current location. Family residence included the following types:(1) country, (2) town, (3) small and medium-sized city, (4) large city. The current location: (1) Guangdong province, (2) Hubei province, (3) the other provinces of China. (Supplementary Material).\nLiving rhythms were assessed through four items: (1) time spent on focusing on COVID-19 information, measured by the average time per day spent on browsing information relating to the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two weeks, (2) Sleeping rhythms were assessed by the following two questions: average daily time waking up in the past two weeks, average daily time going to sleep in the past two weeks, (3) Diet habits, in which participants were asked whether they kept the time and quantity of three meals per day as usual and responded with one of with four choices (never, Seldom, sometimes or always), (4) Exercise habits, in which participants reported their average daily time spent on exercise in the past two weeks. (Supplementary Material).\nThe PHQ-9 Scale was used to measure depressive symptoms. It consists of nine items, each rated on a four-point scale (from 0 = not at all to 3 = almost every day). The score range is 0-27 and higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptomatology. A cutoff of &gt;=10 has been recommended for the diagnosis of depressive symptoms, which provides adequate sensitivity and specificity. In our study, a total score of PHQ-9 &gt;= 10 was used for categorization (that is, with or without depressive symptoms). The Cronbach's alpha for the PHQ-9 in the current sample was 0.89.\nThe RESE scale was developed to assess perceived self-efficacy in managing negative (NEG) and in expressing positive (POS) affect. The Chinese version of this scale consists of a total of 17 items and has been validated and extensively utilized in the Chinese population. NEG includes managing the efficacy of anger-irritation (ANG), despondency-distress (DES), and guilt and shame (COM). POS includes the sense of efficacy of expressing happiness (HAP) and pride (GLO). Participants rated their capability to manage their emotional life with responses ranging from 1 = not well at all to 5 = very well. The higher the score, the higher the sense of RESE. In our study, participants with a score less than the median were defined as the low RESE group, and those with a score higher than the median was defined as the high RESE group. The Cronbach's alpha for the RESE scale in the current sample was 0.93.\nData analysis\nFirst, descriptive analyses were conducted to describe demographic characteristics, living rhythms, depressive symptoms, and RESE status of students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, the data for depressive symptoms and RESE were checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results showed that they were non-normal continuous variables. The prevalence of depressive symptoms and RESE stratified by demographic characteristics and living rhythms characteristics were reported, and Mann-Whitney U tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the differences between groups as appropriate. Third, binary logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the potential influencing factors for depressive symptoms and RESE. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were obtained from the logistic regression models. All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0. P-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant (two-sided tests).\nResults\nDemographic characteristics\nDistribution of depressive symptoms and RESE among participants by demographic characteristics.\nTable 1	 	\nVariables	Number (%)	Depressive symptoms (M +- SD)	RESE (M +- SD)	 	Gender				 	 Male	130,516 (40.3%)	3.22 +- 4.21	64.66 +- 10.59	 	 Female	192,973 (59.7%)	3.63 +- 4.05	63.46 +- 9.34	 			Z = -46.91, p &lt; 0.001, df = 1	Z = -32.87, p &lt; 0.001, df = 1	 	Educational levela				 	 Junior college	188,001 (58.1%)	3.35 +- 4.13	63.79 +- 10.07	 	 Undergraduate college	134,781 (41.7%)	3.64 +- 4.10	64.29 +- 9.60	 			Z = -29.29, p &lt; 0.001, df = 1	Z = -18.44, p &lt; 0.001, df = 1	 	Province				 	 Guangdong province	304,167 (94.0%)	3.46 +- 4.11	63.94 +- 9.87	 	 Hubei province	1221 (0.4%)	3.45 +- 4.18	63.66 +- 9.60	 	 Other provinces	18,101 (5.6%)	3.62 +- 4.27	64.02 +- 9.98	 			chi2 = 15.60, p &lt; 0.001, df = 2	chi2 = 2.33, p = .31, df = 2	 	Grade				 	 Freshman year	130,700 (40.4%)	3.46 +- 4.12	63.72 +- 9.93	 	 Sophomore year	102,460 (31.7%)	3.40 +- 4.09	63.95 +- 9.90	 	 Junior year	66,397 (20.5%)	3.45 +- 4.10	64.18 +- 9.83	 	 Senior year	23,668 (7.3%)	3.86 +- 4.28	64.50 +- 9.57	 	 Fifth year	264 (0.1%)	3.91 +- 4.32	63.74 +- 10.47	 			chi2 = 305.41, p &lt; 0.001, df = 4	chi2 = 255.91, p &lt; 0.001, df = 4	 	Age				 	 18 and below	29,510 (9.1%)	3.60 +- 4.26	63.33 +- 10.04	 	 19-20	167,932 (51.9%)	3.45 +- 4.10	63.85 +- 9.87	 	 21-22	104,800 (32.4%)	3.46 +- 4.11	64.12 +- 9.82	 	 23-24	19,710 (6.1%)	3.49 +- 4.17	64.63 +- 9.81	 	 25 and above	1537 (0.5%)	3.39 +- 4.19	65.42 +- 10.15	 			chi2 = 24.58, p &lt; 0.001, df = 4	chi2 = 392.97, p &lt; 0.001, df = 4	 	Nationality				 	 The Han nationality	319,017 (98.6%)	3.47 +- 4.12	63.95 +- 9.88	 	 Minority nationality	4472 (1.4%)	3.74 +- 4.41	63.60 +- 9.89	 			Z = -3.47, p = .001, df = 1	Z = -2.32, p = .02, df = 1	 	Family residence				 	 County	131,013 (40.5%)	3.23 +- 3.95	63.85 +- 9.70	 	 Town	97,929 (30.3%)	3.59 +- 4.14	63.81 +- 9.79	 	 Small and medium-sized city	57,153 (17.7%)	3.64 +- 4.26	64.14 +- 10.05	 	 Large city	37,394 (11.6%)	3.72 +- 4.40	64.35 +- 10.43	 			chi2 = 692.58, p &lt; 0.001, df = 3	chi2 = 104.22, p &lt; 0.001, df = 3	 	\nAbbreviations: M, mean; SD, Standard deviation; RESE, regulatory emotional self-efficacy.\nZ values derived from Mann-Whitney U tests.\nchi2 values derived from Kruskal-Wallis tests.\nMissing value: 707(0.2%) students did not fill in school name.\nThe majority of participants (84.3%) were in the 19 to 22 years of age range. Females accounted for 59.7% of the total respondents. A significant gender difference was observed, with females reporting lower levels of depressive symptoms and higher levels of RESE than males (Z = -46.91, df = 1, p &lt; .001 and Z = -32.87, df = 1, p &lt; .001; respectively). Most respondents (94.0%) were located in Guangdong province, while 0.4% were located in Hubei Province and 5.6% were located in other provinces. Significant differences in the level of depressive symptoms were found according to location: students in the other provinces had higher scores of depressive symptoms than those in Guangdong or Hubei (chi 2 = 15.60, df = 2, p &lt; .001). However, there was no statistically significant difference in RESE according to province (chi 2 = 2.33, df = 2, p = .31). Grade of study, age, nationality, educational level, and family residence all showed significant differences according to the students' depressive symptoms and RESE scores.

According to the cutoff of PHQ-9 &gt;= 10, which has been recommended for the diagnosis of depressive symptoms, depressive symptoms was detected in 7.7% of participants. We summarized the mean scores for each of the PHQ-9 items as responded to by the college students with depressive symptoms, as shown in Table 2 . We found that &quot;lack of energy&quot;, &quot;lack of pleasure&quot; and &quot;sleep disorder&quot; were the main symptoms with the highest average scores. During the past two weeks, the incidence of suicidal ideation was 7.2%: 0.4% (1143) of the students had suicidal thoughts almost every day, 0.9% (2804) had suicidal thoughts for more than a week, and 5.9% (18,986) had suicidal thoughts over a few days. The average score for the RESE was 63.95 +- 9.88. The score for POS (4.12 +- 0.60) was higher than for NEG (3.56 +- 0.70), especially for ANG (3.53 +- 0.77) which was the lowest score overall. We found significant differences in the RESE scores between students with and without depressive symptoms: students with depressive symptoms had lower levels of RESE (55.5 +- 10.1) than those without depressive symptoms (64.7 +- 9.5) (Z = -134.58, p &lt; .001).\nLiving rhythms of students during the COVID-19 pandemic\nDistribution of depressive symptoms and RESE among participants by living rhythms.\nTable 3	 	\nVariable	Number (%)	Depressive symptoms (M +- SD)	RESE (M +- SD)	 	Time on browsing COVID-19 information				 	 &lt;1 h	167,532 (51.8%)	3.53 +- 4.19	62.90 +- 9.89	 	 1-2 h	122,311 (37.8%)	3.33 +- 3.91	65.09 +- 9.47	 	 3-5 h	177,37 (5.5%)	3.67 +- 4.26	65.17 +- 9.96	 	 &gt;5 h	15,909 (4.9%)	3.72 +- 4.77	64.78 +- 11.42	 			chi2 = 99.02, p &lt; 0.001, df = 3	chi2 = 4162.59, p &lt; 0.001, df = 1	 	Exercise time				 	 Never	68,947 (21.3%)	4.51 +- 4.93	60.47 +- 10.31	 	 &lt;30 min	180,381 (55.8%)	3.38 +- 3.87	64.11 +- 9.29	 	 30-60 min	62,526 (19.3%)	2.71 +- 3.59	66.71 +- 9.57	 	 &gt;60 min	11,635 (3.6%)	2.73 +- 4.08	67.10 +- 11.35	 			chi2 = 6151.94, p &lt; 0.001, df = 3	chi2 = 15,035.48, p &lt; 0.001, df = 3	 	Wake time				 	 Before 6:00	1580 (0.5%)	4.47 +- 5.64	62.44 +- 14.31	 	 6:00-8:00	32,134 (9.9%)	2.75 +- 3.67	65.73 +- 10.11	 	 8:00-10:00	138,537 (42.8%)	2.94 +- 3.59	65.13 +- 9.41	 	 After 10:00	107,041 (33.1%)	3.87 +- 4.28	63.04 +- 9.77	 	 Irregular	44,197 (13.7%)	4.65 +- 5.05	61.20 +- 10.39	 			chi2 = 6420.66, p &lt; 0.001, df = 4	chi2 = 8093.02, p &lt; 0.001, df = 4	 	Sleep time				 	 Before 22:00	11,058 (3.4%)	2.55 +- 3.87	66.20 +- 11.43	 	 22:00-24:00	133,280 (41.2%)	2.66 +- 3.37	65.80 +- 9.31	 	 After 24:00	111,871 (34.6%)	3.98 +- 4.29	62.97 +- 9.68	 	 Irregular	67,280 (20.8%)	4.37 +- 4.82	61.53 +- 10.25	 			chi2 = 9968.42, p &lt; 0.001, df = 3	chi2 = 11,459.62, p &lt; 0.001, df = 3	 	Diet habits (regular frequency and quantity)				 	 Never	9019 (2.8%)	6.41 +- 6.32	58.20 +- 12.00	 	 Seldom	25,479 (7.9%)	5.97 +- 5.21	59.64 +- 9.93	 	 Sometimes	80,199 (24.8%)	4.62 +- 4.30	62.00 +- 9.17	 	 Always	208,792 (64.5%)	2.59 +- 3.42	65.47 +- 9.65	 			chi2 = 27,835.34, p &lt; 0.001, df = 3	chi2 = 15,858.61, p &lt; 0.001, df = 3	 	\nAbbreviations: M, mean; SD, Standard deviation; RESE, regulatory emotional self-efficacy, COVID-19, 2019 Coronavirus Disease.\nchi2 values derived from Kruskal-Wallis tests.\nThe living rhythms of students during the COVID-19 pandemic are summarized in Table 3 . Browsing information relating to COVID-19 was undertaken by 51.8% of the students for less than 1 h, by 37.8% for 1-2 h, 5.5.% for 3-5 h and 4.9.% for more than 5 h per day. Depressive symptoms of the students differed according to the average time spent on pandemic information per day (chi 2 = 99.02, df = 3, p &lt; .001), and those focusing on it for more than 5 h per day had the highest scores of depressive symptoms. In terms of physical exercise, students who had not undertaken exercise in the past two weeks accounted for 21.3% of the total participants whereas 55.8% exercised for 30 min, and only 3.6% of the students exercised for more than 1 h. Non-parametric tests showed that students who exercised for more than 30 min had lower depressive symptoms and higher RESE scores compared to the other students (chi 2 = 6151.94, df = 3, p &lt; .001 and chi 2 = 15,035.48, df = 3, p &lt; .001; respectively). As for sleeping rhythms, most students would wake up from 6:00-8:00 and go to bed from 22:00-24:00. Many students got up after 10:00 or irregularly, accounting for 33.1% and 13.7% of the participants, respectively. More than half of the students went to bed later than 24:00 or irregularly, accounting for 55.4% in total. There were statistically significant differences in depressive symptoms and RESE scores according to the sleeping rhythms of college students (as shown in Table 3). In terms of diet, 10.7% of students &quot;Seldom&quot; or &quot;never&quot; kept to the usual habit of three meals per day and their depressive symptoms were significantly higher and RESE scores were significantly lower than the other students (chi 2 = 27,835.34, df = 3, p &lt; .001 and chi 2 = 15,858.61, df = 3, p &lt; .001; respectively).\nAssociations between living rhythms, depressive symptoms and RESE\nBinary logistic regression analyses for depressive symptoms and RESE by living rhythms.\nTable 4	 	\nVariable	Participants with and without depressive symptomsa	Participants with high and low RESEb	 	OR (95% CI)	p	OR (95% CI)	p	 	Time on browsing COVID-19 information		&lt;0.001		&lt;0.001	 	 &lt;1 h	1.00		1.00		 	 1-2 h	0.99 (0.96-1.02)	0.43	0.77 (0.76-0.78)	&lt;0.001	 	 3-5 h	1.30 (1.23-1.38)	&lt;0.001	0.75 (0.72-0.77)	&lt;0.001	 	 &gt;5 h	1.33 (1.26-1.41)	&lt;0.001	0.78 (0.75-0.80)	&lt;0.001	 	Exercise time		&lt;0.001		&lt;0.001	 	 Never	1.00		1.00		 	 &lt;30 min	0.61 (0.59-0.63)	&lt;0.001	0.63 (0.61-0.64)	&lt;0.001	 	 30-60 min	0.50 (0.48-0.52)	&lt;0.001	0.43 (0.42-0.44)	&lt;0.001	 	 &gt;60 min	0.63 (0.58-0.69)	&lt;0.001	0.42 (0.40-0.44)	&lt;0.001	 	Wake time		&lt;0.001		&lt;0.001	 	 Before 6:00	1.00		1.00		 	 6:00-8:00	0.47 (0.40-0.54)	&lt;0.001	0.72 (0.65-0.80)	0.001	 	 8:00-10:00	0.37 (0.31-0.42)	&lt;0.001	0.69 (0.62-0.76)	&lt;0.001	 	 After 10:00	0.38 (0.33-0.44)	&lt;0.001	0.70 (0.63-0.78)	&lt;0.001	 	 Irregular	0.48 (0.41-0.56)	&lt;0.001	0.79 (0.71-0.88)	&lt;0.001	 	Sleep time		&lt;0.001		&lt;0.001	 	 Before 22:00	1.00		1.00		 	 22:00-24:00	0.82 (0.75-0.90)	&lt;0.001	1.07 (1.03-1.12)	&lt;0.001	 	 After 24:00	1.53 (1.39-1.68)	&lt;0.001	1.44 (1.38-1.51)	&lt;0.001	 	 Irregular	1.58 (1.43-1.73)	&lt;0.001	1.68 (1.60-1.75)	&lt;0.001	 	Diet habits (regular frequency and quantity)		&lt;0.001		&lt;0.001	 	 Never	1.00		1.00		 	 Seldom	0.82 (0.77-0.86)	&lt;0.001	1.00 (0.95-1.06)	0.98	 	 Sometimes	0.47 (0.44-0.49)	&lt;0.001	0.77 (0.74-0.81)	&lt;0.001	 	 Always	0.19 (0.18-0.20)	&lt;0.001	0.47 (0.45-0.49)	&lt;0.001	 	 Constant	0.72	&lt;0.001	3.38	&lt;0.001	 	\nAbbreviations: RESE, regulatory emotional self-efficacy; OR, odds ratio; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; COVID-19, 2019 Coronavirus Disease.\nWith depressive symptoms included individuals with PHQ-9 &gt;= 10, without depressive symptoms was defined as individuals with PHQ-9 &lt; 10.\nHigh RESE included individuals with RESE scores higher than the median, low RESE was defined as RESE scores lower than the median.\nIn the binary logistic regression models, time on browsing COVID-19 information, exercise, wake time, sleep time, and regular frequency of three meals were all significantly associated with depressive symptoms and RESE (Table 4 ). Time on browsing COVID-19 information for 3-5 h or &gt; 5 h were risk factors for depressive symptoms (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.23-1.38, p &lt; .001 and OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.26-1.41, p &lt; .001; respectively), and sleeping times later than 24:00 or irregular bedtimes were also harmful factors relating to depressive symptoms (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.39-1.68, p &lt; .001 and OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.43-1.73, p &lt; .001, respectively). Three protective factors for depressive symptoms were also identified (all p &lt; .001): doing some exercise, keeping a regular diet, and a waking time later than 6:00. Even less than 30 min of exercise was found to be protective for RESE (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.61-0.64, p &lt; .001) and keeping regular three meals &quot;sometimes&quot; (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.74-0.81, p &lt; .001) or &quot;always&quot; (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.45-0.49, p &lt; .001) helped increase RESE referring to &quot;never&quot;. Students who focused on the COVID-19 pandemic for 3 h or more per day were not likely to develop lower RESE than those spending less than 1 h (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.72-0.77, p &lt; .001 and OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.75-0.80, p &lt; .001; respectively).\nDiscussion\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Health Commission of China released the notification of basic principles for emergency psychological crisis interventions on 26 January 2020. The Chinese Ministry of Education has issued official documents to support colleges and universities in providing psychological assistance hotlines on 28 January 2020. To date, there remains few epidemiological data on the mental health problems and psychiatric morbidity of college students. A recent study on the prevalence of anxiety in Chinese college students suggested that the COVID-19- related stressors (included effects on daily-life, and academic delays) were positively associated with the level of anxiety symptoms, indicating that the mental health of college students could be affected by public health emergencies. In this study, we supplemented the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese college students and explored potential influencing factors.\nEvidence indicated that major mental health burdens of the public during the COVID-19 outbreak included anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms and sleep disorder. A study surveyed immediate psychological responses among Chinese general population by using the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), showing that 4.3% respondents were considered to suffer from severe and extremely severe depressive symptoms (DASS-21 &gt;= 21) in the initial outbreak of the pandemic (from January 31 to February 2, 2020). There was no significant longitudinal reduction in depressive level in the pandemic's peak four weeks later (from February 28 to March 1, 2020). Besides, student status was associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak, higher levels of stress, and depression. Similarly, our study demonstrated that 7.7% of students reported depressive symptoms, relatively higher than the detection rates of depressive symptoms among general population during the pandemic. The incidence of suicidal ideation in our study was 7.2%. According to a survey conducted on Chinese college students in 2014, 9.1% (n = 479) of the 5245 students reported they have at some point thought about committing suicide. One meta-analysis has shown that the overall pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese college students is 10.72%. Furthermore, the low prevalence of suicidal ideation in our study corresponds to the findings of recent epidemiological studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey of 673 healthy adults by Tan W et al. found that the prevalence of suicidal ideation was less than 2%. Another study of people with and without psychiatric illnesses during the pandemic demonstrated that only 0.9% of healthy control reported suicidal ideation. To some extent, while the current pandemic takes away health and life, college students are reminded to think about the theme of death. Although COVID-19 has created considerable stress and worry along with having significant impacts on daily life, healthcare professionals are on the front lines, battling diseases and caring for sick and dying patients, even while knowingly putting themselves at risk. The determination of healthcare professionals to save lives as reported in the news is one form of positive life education. This may account for the high prevalence of depressive symptoms but relatively low suicidal ideation among college students during the pandemic as reported here.\nIn terms of demographic factors, female respondents showed significantly higher depressive symptoms than their male counterparts. This finding corresponds to previous study which found that women were at higher risk of depression. Another recent study also reported that female had a greater psychological impact as well as higher levels of depression during the outbreak of COVID-19. Several studies have found that senior students have higher depressive symptoms compared with freshmen, similar to our findings. This may be because the higher grade students face more stressful events, such as graduation and employment.\nA recent study demonstrated that majority of Chinese people stayed at home for 20-24 h per day during the COVID-19 pandemic (84.7%). It is necessary to learn about the relationship between the living rhythms and the mental health when they were quarantined at home. Our study noted that college students who went to bed early (before 24:00), rose early (6:00-8:00), undertook physical exercise and kept a regular diet had fewer depressive symptoms. Disruptions to circadian rhythms can lead to affective changes and may elicit or exacerbate symptoms in individuals with a predisposition for mental health disorders. The associations between physical exercise, depression, and stress have already been widely discussed. Physical exercise was significantly and meaningfully associated with self-reported mental health burden, and might also mitigate the social isolation stress on immune system. Furthermore, our research shows that during the COVID-19 pandemic, students who browse the pandemic information for less than 2 h a day have the lowest levels of depressive symptoms, and those who browse events for more than 5 h have the highest levels of depressive symptoms. This is consistent with the results by Yeen Huang and colleagues that young people who spend too much time browsing information of the COVID-19 pandemic are at high risk for mental illness. From the perspective of stress theory, excessive attention on information of the current pandemic may lead to alternative trauma. Although college students quarantined at home have no personal experience of infection and treatment, they show empathy through visceral experience when browsing the information about the death of patients and health care workers. And some college students might study in healthcare subjects and they are empathetic about the high stress levels experienced by healthcare workers. Excessive empathy can also cause psychological pain and trauma.\nWe also found that favorable living rhythms are conducive to maintaining good levels of RESE, which refers to the degree of confidence with which individuals can effectively regulate their emotional state. This self-confidence can help individuals to use positive emotional regulation methods to adjust their emotions effectively. In our study, the factor score for POS was higher than for NEG, and the score for ANG was the lowest. These results remind us of the need to pay attention to strengthening college students' skills in regulating negative emotions, in particular in regulating anger. Studies have shown that low levels of RESE can affect mental health, especially depressive symptoms. RESE is a positive psychological quality that can help individuals fight depressive symptoms, anxiety and other negative emotions. People with good RESE are less likely to have depressive symptoms, that is, different RESE levels have different probabilities for depressive symptoms. Therefore, RESE is also a protective factor against depressive symptoms in difficult circumstances such as the current pandemic.\nThe findings of this study lead to several recommendations for future interventions. First, we recommend that methods of emotion regulation should be publicized to college students during the pandemic, particularly relating to the relationship between living rhythms and emotion, and skills for improving negative emotion regulation efficacy. This could be achieved through online means. Second, we suggest that the home-school alliance should promote the need for students to create positive living rhythms, such as going to bed early, rising on time, and consuming regular meals. Third, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the COVID-19 pandemic should be provided, and due in course, information about the return to school arrangements and academic tasks should be provided to address students' sense of uncertainty and improve their sense of control over life. Fourth, we suggest that college students try to limit their time spent on the current pandemic to no more than 2 h a day, only pay attention to the necessary information (such as clear facts and data). Fifth, colleges and universities should take the following personal and organizational prevention measures before the school reopen, such as keeping hand hygiene and wearing face masks, as well as good ventilation. Improvement of school hygiene and increased concerns on students' physical health status could be helpful for reducing psychiatric problems.\nThis study has several limitations. First, the data and relevant analyses presented here were derived from a cross-sectional design, so it is difficult to make causal inferences. Second, the study adopts a network survey method because of quarantine. The sampling in our study was voluntary and conducted online but the possibility of bias should be nonetheless be considered. Third, based on the convenience sampling method, the participants in this study were college students in Guangdong Province. As a result, it cannot be applied to other provinces in China or other countries. In future research, stratified sampling needs to be carried out across the Chinese provinces in order to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation of Chinese college students.\nIn conclusion, this observational cross-sectional clinical study aimed to determine the living rhythms and mental health of college students during quarantine at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through conducting a large-scale survey, we found that staying up late or irregular bedtimes were prominent problems experienced by college students when quarantined at home, which is worth paying attention to. Favorable living rhythms and moderate attention towards the pandemic may be protective factors for depressive symptoms and RESE. Our findings can be used to formulate psychological interventions aiming to prevent psychological problems in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors have no competing interests to report.\nReferences\nThe mental health of medical workers in Wuhan, China dealing with the 2019 novel coronavirus\nTrend and forecasting of the COVID-19 outbreak in China\nPsychological responses, behavioral changes and public perceptions during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a population based cross-sectional survey\nPsychosocial and coping responses within the community health care setting towards a national outbreak of an infectious disease\nTimely mental health care for the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is urgently needed\nImmediate psychological responses and associated factors during the initial stage of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic among the general population in China\nA longitudinal study on the mental health of general population during the COVID-19 epidemic in China\nDo psychiatric patients experience more psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown?

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 2324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·472·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·87·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227805), 113 (57193), 98 (49168), 111 (56191), and 80 (40139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 12 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"An updated estimation of the risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-ncov)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"National Health Commission of People's Republic of China (2020).

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

(one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth.\n The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation.\n We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0.\n Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.\n The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 1825) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.\n We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.492.63).\n Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.\n","id":"PMC7074332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Shi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinjun","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangpu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daozhou","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel CoronavirusInfected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

next lethal viral epidemic that occurs.\n\n\nMethod\nThe 1995 Kikwit Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formally Zaire) is one of the most well studied epidemics to have occurred to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nWhen an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered.\n\n Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities.\n\n The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities.\n At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down.\n It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities.\n Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma.\n The severity of this epidemic and its long-lasting repercussions

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire.\n\n Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access.\n\n\nIn addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6).\n\n The total Impact of Event ScaleRevised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n The perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level and the number of physical symptoms were associated with higher IES-R Score (P&lt;.\n\n05).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis is one of the first few studies demonstrating the use of Internet in data collection during an air-pollution crisis.\n\n Our results demonstrated that the newer technological modalities have the potential to acquire data, similar to that of conventional technologies.\n\n Demographic variables did not influence the mechanism of usage.\n\n In addition, our findings also suggested that there are acute physical and psychological impacts on the population

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 2024 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028","date":"2020-04-10","title":"A longitudinal study on the mental health of general population during the COVID-19 epidemic in China","abstract":"\n\n\n\nA significant reduction in psychological impact 4 weeks after COVID outbreak.\n","id":"PMC7153528","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger S.","surname":"McIntyre","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Faith N.","surname":"Choo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bach","surname":"Tran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vijay K.","surname":"Sharma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/ijerph17072381","date":"2020-03-28","title":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Quality of Life among Local Residents in Liaoning Province, China: A Cross-Sectional Study","abstract":"Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and quality of life among local Chinese residents aged ?18 years in Liaoning Province, mainland China.\n An online survey was distributed through a social media platform between January and February 2020.

In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak.\n An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China.\n A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants.\n The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days.\n Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor.\n The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%.\n The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days.\n In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P&lt;0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019. Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for Chinese residents to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices.\n Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to populations of a low socioeconomic status.\n","id":"PMC7098034","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Ivyspring International Publisher","authors":[{"firstname":"Bao-Liang","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hai-Mei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qian-Qian","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Ge","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-Tian","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.069","date":"2020-04-25","title":"Do psychiatric patients experience more psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown?

and Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Overweight Female Workers","abstract":"Previous studies have suggested that physical activity (PA) levels and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) impact on the autonomic control of heart rate (HR).\n However, previous studies evaluating PA levels did not discriminate between incidental PA and regular exercise.\n We hypothesized that incidental PA per se would influence cardiac autonomic indices as assessed via HR variability (HRV) and HR recovery (HRR) in non-exercisers.\n Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the relationships between objective PA levels, CRF, and cardiac autonomic indices in adult, regular non-exercising female workers.\n After familiarization with procedures and evaluation of body composition, 21 women completed a submaximal cycling test and evaluation of HRR on four different days.\n Resting (2-min seated and standing) and ambulatory (4-h) HRV were also recorded.\n Levels of PA were assessed by accelerometry over five consecutive days (i.\ne.\n, Wednesday to Sunday).\n Maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) was measured as an index of CRF.\n As reliability was low to moderate for most HR measures, relationships between these and PA and CRF were examined using the 4-day average measures.\n Significant correlations were identified between post-exercise HRR in the first min with various PA indices (daily moderate PA, daily vigorous PA, and the sum of vigorous and very vigorous daily PA).\n Additionally, VO2max was significantly correlated to HRV but not to HRR.\n The current results indicated that CRF was influential in enhancing HRV while incidental or non-exercise based PA was associated with greater autonomic reactivation in adult overweight women.\n Therefore, both CRF and non-exercise based PA contribute significant but diverse effects on cardiac health.\n The use of 4-day averages instead of single measures for evaluation of autonomic control of HR may provide a better indication of regular cardiac autonomic function that remains to be refined.\n","id":"PMC4704056","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

increasingly robust.\n\n However, motivating patients with depression to engage in physical activity can be challenging.\n\n Interdisciplinary group medical visits (GMVs) with an integrated physical activity component may be a novel means to support patients in becoming more active.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a prepost pilot study within a primary care setting.\n\n Participants were adults (?18?years) with a chronic major depressive disorder or a bipolar 2 disorder (depression; chronic).\n\n A psychiatrist and exercise therapist co-led a series of 14 weekly 2?h GMVs.\n\n Each group visit combined specific medical advice, physical activity, patient discussions and a targeted educational component.\n\n Participants also attended 11 weekly hatha yoga classes.\n\n Primary outcome was steps as measured by accelerometer (SenseWear) as well as depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder, GAD-7) ratings.\n\n\nResults\n14 of 15 participants (93.3%) completed the 14-week programme.\n\n After 3?months postintervention, median depression scales (PHQ-9) decreased 38% from 16 to 10 (p&lt;0.01; IQR pre/post 8/12); and median anxiety scales (GAD-7) decreased 50% from 13 to 6.5 (p&lt;0.05; IQR 8.5/9).\n\n Median daily steps increased 71% from 3366 to 5746 (IQR 2610/6237), though this was not significant (p&gt;0.10).\n\n\nConclusions\nWhile other studies have examined the efficacy of GMVs in addressing chronic illnesses and the promotion of lifestyle changes, none to our knowledge have embedded physical activity within the actual patient visits.\n\n Interdisciplinary GMVs (eg, psychiatrist/exercise professional) may be a means to decrease depression and anxiety ratings within clinical care while improving physical activity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5117054","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"David

disease and type 2 diabetes pose a global health burden.\n\n Therefore, clarifying the pathology of these risk factors is essential.\n\n Previous studies have found positive and negative associations between one or more cardiovascular risk factors and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) probably due to diverse methodological approaches when analysing peripheral BDNF levels.\n\n Moreover, only a few studies have been performed in youth populations.\n\n Consequently, the main objective of this study was to examine the association between serum BDNF and a composite z-score consisting of six cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n A secondary aim was to examine the associations between serum BDNF and each of the six risk factors.\n\n\nMethods\nFour hundred and forty-seven apparently healthy adolescents between 1117 years of age participated in this cross-sectional study.\n\n Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), anthropometrics, pubertal status, blood pressure (BP), serum BDNF, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG), blood glucose and insulin were measured.\n\n Information about alcohol consumption and socio-economic status was collected via questionnaires.\n\n Associations were modelled using linear regression analysis.\n\n\nResults\nSerum BDNF was positively associated with the composite z-score in the total study sample (standardized beta coefficient (std.\n\n?) = 0.10, P = 0.037).\n\n In males, serum BDNF was positively associated with the composite z-score (Std.\n\n ? = 0.14, P = 0.034) and HOMA-IR (Std.\n\n ? = 0.19, P = 0.004), and negatively associated with CRF (Std.\n\n ? = -0.15, P = 0.026).\n\n In females, BDNF was positively associated with TG (Std.\n\n ? = 0.14, P = 0.030) and negatively associated with waist circumference (WC) (Std.\n\n ? = -0.16, P = 0.012).\n\n\nConclusion\nSerum BDNF was positively associated with a composite z-score of cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n This association seems to be mainly driven by the association between TG, HOMA-IR and serum BDNF, and particularly for males.\n\n Further longitudinal research is warranted to determine the temporal relationship between BDNF and cardiovascular risk

this illness is unknown.\n Several lines of evidence suggest that peripheral and central inflammation plays a role in depressive symptoms, and that anti-inflammatory drugs can improve depressive symptoms in patients with inflammation-related depression.\n Signaling via brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomycin receptor kinase B (TrkB) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of depression and in the therapeutic mechanisms of antidepressants.\n A recent paper showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation gave rise to depression-like phenotype by altering BDNF-TrkB signaling in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens, areas thought to be involved in the antidepressant effects of TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) and TrkB antagonist, ANA-12. Here we provide an overview of the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway and BDNF-TrkB signaling in the pathophysiology of inflammation-induced depression, and propose mechanistic actions for potential therapeutic agents.\n Additionally, the authors discuss the putative role of TrkB agonists and antagonists as novel therapeutic drugs for inflammation-related depression.\n","id":"PMC5050398","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Bentham Science Publishers","authors":[{"firstname":"Ji-chun","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Yao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kenji","surname":"Hashimoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajp.2015.12.008","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Is there a bi-directional relationship between depression and obesity among adult men and women?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1207/s15324796abm3201_8","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Leisure time physical activity in relation to depressive symptoms in the Black Women's Health Study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1123/japa.15.1.41","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Depression and exercise in elderly men and women: findings from the Swedish national study on aging and care","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ypmed.2008.01.009","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Physical activity and likelihood of depression in adults: a review","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1525-1446.2011.00986.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Physical activity status in adults with depression in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2005-2006","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jad.2012.07.001","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Activity monitoring in patients with depression: a systematic review","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1002/wps.20458","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Sedentary behavior and physical activity levels in people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder: a global systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"How many steps/day are enough?

guidelines from around the world are typically expressed in terms of frequency, duration, and intensity parameters.\n Objective monitoring using pedometers and accelerometers offers a new opportunity to measure and communicate physical activity in terms of steps/day.\n Various step-based versions or translations of physical activity guidelines are emerging, reflecting public interest in such guidance.\n However, there appears to be a wide discrepancy in the exact values that are being communicated.\n It makes sense that step-based recommendations should be harmonious with existing evidence-based public health guidelines that recognize that 'some physical activity is better than none' while maintaining a focus on time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).\n Thus, the purpose of this review was to update our existing knowledge of 'How many steps/day are enough?', and to inform step-based recommendations consistent with current physical activity guidelines.\n Normative data indicate that healthy adults typically take between 4,000 and 18,000 steps/day, and that 10,000 steps/day is reasonable for this population, although there are notable 'low active populations.\n' Interventions demonstrate incremental increases on the order of 2,000-2,500 steps/day.\n The results of seven different controlled studies demonstrate that there is a strong relationship between cadence and intensity.\n Further, despite some inter-individual variation, 100 steps/minute represents a reasonable floor value indicative of moderate intensity walking.\n Multiplying this cadence by 30 minutes (i.\ne.\n, typical of a daily recommendation) produces a minimum of 3,000 steps that is best used as a heuristic (i.\ne.\n, guiding) value, but these steps must be taken over and above habitual activity levels to be a true expression of free-living steps/day that also includes recommendations for minimal amounts of time in MVPA.\n Computed steps/day translations of time in MVPA that also include estimates of habitual activity levels equate to 7,100 to 11,000 steps/day.\n A direct estimate of minimal amounts of MVPA accumulated in the course of objectively monitored free-living behaviour is 7,000-8,000 steps/day.\n A scale that spans a wide range of incremental increases in steps/day and is congruent with public health recognition that 'some physical activity is better than none,' yet still incorporates step-based translations of recommended amounts of time in MVPA may be useful in research and practice.\n The full range of users (researchers to practitioners to the general public) of objective monitoring instruments that provide step-based outputs require good reference data and evidence-based recommendations to be able to design effective health messages congruent with public health physical activity guidelines, guide behaviour change, and ultimately measure, track, and interpret steps/day.\n","id":"PMC3197470","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

establish movement patterns of mildly to moderately affected sufferers to estimate the treatment potential.\n\n The aim is to describe the physical activity patterns of people affected by mild to moderate depressive and/or anxiety symptoms using objective measures of physical activity.\n\n\nMethods\nThe design of the study was cross-sectional using data from 165 people aged 1865 years, with mild to moderate depressive and/or anxiety disorder symptoms (scoring ?10 on the PHQ-9).\n\n Diagnoses were made using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and symptom severity was measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).\n\n The participants wore accelerometers for a week to evaluate physical activity patterns.\n\n\nResults\nNo statistically significant differences were detected between different diagnoses, though depressed participants tended to be less active and more sedentary.\n\n Only one-fifth of the sample followed public health guidelines regarding physical activity.\n\n Each one point increase in MADRS was associated with a 2.4 minute reduction in light physical activity, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary time.\n\n MADRS was positively associated with number of sedentary bouts.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe physical activity pattern of people with depressive and/or anxiety disorders was characterized by large amounts of sedentary time and low fulfillment of physical activity guidelines.\n\n There is therefore a large treatment potential for this group by increasing exercise.\n\n The results suggest that instead of focusing exclusively on high intensity exercise for treating depressive and anxiety disorders, health care providers might encourage patients to reduce sedentary time by increasing light physical activity and decreasing the number of sedentary bouts, though further studies are needed that can determine directionality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4293141","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Intervention Using Behavioral Activation and Physical Activity for Adults With Depression (The eMotion Study): Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","abstract":"Background\nPhysical activity is a potentially effective treatment for depression and depressive relapse.\n\n However, promoting physical activity in people with depression is challenging.\n\n Interventions informed by theory and evidence are therefore needed to support people with depression to become more physically active.\n\n eMotion is a Web-based intervention combining behavioral activation and physical activity promotion for people in the community with symptoms of depression.\n\n\nObjective\nThe objectives were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering eMotion to people in the community with symptoms of depression and to explore outcomes.\n\n\nMethods\nParticipants with elevated depressive symptoms were recruited from the community through various methods (eg, social media) and randomized to eMotion or a waiting list control group for 8 weeks.\n\n eMotion is an administratively supported weekly modular program that helps people use key behavior change techniques (eg, graded tasks, action planning, and self-monitoring) to re-engage in routine, pleasurable, and necessary activities, with a focus on physical activities.\n\n Feasibility data were collected that included the following: recruitment and trial retention rates; fidelity of intervention delivery, receipt, and enactment; and acceptability of the intervention and data collection procedures.\n\n Data were collected for the primary (depression) and secondary outcomes (eg, anxiety, physical activity, fidelity, and client satisfaction) at baseline and 2 months postrandomization using self-reported Web-based questionnaires and accelerometers.\n\n Delivery fidelity (logins, modules accessed, time spent) was tracked using Web usage statistics.\n\n Exploratory analyses were conducted on the primary and secondary outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 183 people who contacted the research team, 62 were recruited and randomized.\n\n The mean baseline score was 14.6 (SD 3.2) on the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8).\n\n Of those randomized, 52 participants provided accelerometer-recorded physical activity data at baseline that showed a median of 35.8 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.0-98.6) minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recorded in at least 10-minute bouts per week, with only 13% (7/52) people achieving guideline levels (150 minutes of MVPA per week).\n\n In total, 81% (50/62) of participants provided follow-up data for the primary outcome (PHQ-8), but only 39% (24/62) provided follow-up accelerometer data.\n\n Within the intervention group, the median number of logins, modules accessed, and total minutes spent on eMotion was 3 (IQR 2.0-8.0), 3 (IQR 2.0-5.0), and 41.3 (IQR 18.9-90.4), respectively.\n\n Acceptability was mixed.\n\n Exploratory data analysis showed that PHQ-8 levels were lower for the intervention group than for the control group at 2 months postrandomization (adjusted mean difference ?3.6, 95% CI ?6.1 to ?1.1).\n\n\nConclusions\nIt was feasible to deliver eMotion in UK communities to inactive populations.\n\n eMotion has the potential to be effective and is ready for testing in a full-scale trial.\n\n

There were no gender related differences either.\n\n\nConclusions:\nAs impulsivity can lead to suicide and is implicated for substance abuse in disorders like Schizophrenia, it is important that culturally sensitive impulsivity studies are done in India on a large scale keeping in view the large size of population.\n\n Standardization of the BIS11-A Hindi version is being taken up.\n\n The work on Hindi version also generates necessity for other tasks if BIS-11(Hindi version) is to be used widely.\n\n Work on psychometric properties of Hindi version of BIS-11 A is being taken up.\n\n There is a need to devise a quick way to calculate impulsivity scores keeping in view the large population of India (1 billion out of which at least 33% is Hindi speaking, Census Survey of India, 2001).\n\n Besides, BIS-11A needs to be developed for other regional languages in India as there is a high-linguistic diversity in India.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2738344","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Medknow Publications","authors":[{"firstname":"Paramjeet","surname":"Singh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R.

all States/Territories will be reporting data for 200304, and a number have been doing so for several years.\n\n Having said this, there is considerable variability regarding data coverage, completeness and compliance.\n\n Some States/Territories have gone to considerable lengths to 'embed' outcome measurement in day-to-day practice.\n\n To date, reporting of outcome data has largely been limited to reports profiling individual consumers and/or aggregate reports that focus on compliance and data quality issues, although a few States/Territories have begun to turn their attention to producing aggregate reports of consumers by clinician, team or service.\n\n\nConclusion\nRoutine outcome measurement is possible if it is supported by a co-ordinated, strategic approach and strong leadership, and there is commitment from clinicians and managers.\n\n The Australian experience can provide lessons for other countries.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1097711","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Jane","surname":"Pirkis","email":"j.pirkis@unimelb.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philip","surname":"Burgess","email":"p.burgess@uq.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tim","surname":"Coombs","email":"timcoombs@bigpond.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Adam","surname":"Clarke","email":"Adam.Clarke@StrategicData.com.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Jones-Ellis","email":"david.jones-ellis@strategicdata.com.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rosemary","surname":"Dickson","email":"Rosemary.Dickson@nswiop.nsw.edu.au","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1017/S0033291706007823","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Factors distinguishing suicide attempters from suicide ideators in a community sample: social issues and physical health problems","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Gender differences of the undergraduates' suicide probability","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00127-008-0345-x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The prevalence and socio-demographic correlations of depression, anxiety and stress among a group of university students","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Analysis on the association between family income and potential risk of college students' suicide ideation","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Suicide rates in China 1995-1999 [J]","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1192/bjp.179.2.104","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Child sexual abuse, poor parental care and adult depression: evidence for different mechanisms","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1192/bjp.bp.107.042515","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Family relationships in childhood and common psychiatric disorders in later life: systematic review of prospective studies","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Suicide ideation, planning and attempts: results from the Israel national health survey [J]","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Correlates and predictors of self-reported suicide attempts among incarcerated youths [J]","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prevalence of suicidal ideation in Chinese college students: a meta-analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Suicide deaths concentrated in Beijing universities","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The relationship between seriously considering, planning, and attempting suicide in the youth risk behavior survey","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"National Research Council (2002) Reducing Suicide: A National Imperative.

The total number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide rapidly exceeded those from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and in March 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Such results may directly affect the mental health of people. Although researchers worldwide race with unprecedented efforts to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, this may not be available soon enough to control the pandemic. Hence, restrictions on social contact (large-scale lock-down) and appropriate infection prevention strategies (travel limitation, quarantine, and self-isolation) have been implemented in order to prevent the spread of the virus.\nTogether with the strong person-to-person transmission capability of the virus, the strain that COVID-19 poses on public health and the implemented restrictions may have detrimental effects on mental health, including overwhelming fear and anxiety. Several individual factors can modulate mental health outcomes in reaction to such a stressful event. Thus, a timely evaluation of the detrimental effects of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health may inform mental health policies. In general, a group of college students is of particular interest to researchers as they experience multifaceted pressures such as academic workload, economic difficulties, and interpersonal relationship. These stressful experiences may put college students at high risk of future mental health problems (e.g., depression and anxiety). For example, a meta-analytical review (including 32,694 Chinese college students) indicated the overall prevalence of depression among this age group is 23.8% (95% CI: 19.9-28.5%). Recently, a survey conducted in Eastern China found that 21.4% of 1,931 college students reported having symptoms of anxiety. Besides the two common negative emotions, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were also reported with 16.6% of 1,081 college students. In addition, young college students typically exhibit a higher frequency of inter-individual contacts, and therefore social distancing measures (travel restrictions, quarantine, and self-isolation) during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a more profound impact on their daily life. Furthermore, excessive lack of or incorrect sensationalistic information by the mass media, fear of infection, witnessing death and suffering of the general population in the media, personal experiences of bereavement without the possibility to assist relatives or significant others, the impossibility to ritualize the loss with a funeral are all risk factors to develop poor mental health, beyond social isolation.\nAccording to previous studies, psychological reactions to stressful and life-threatening situations differ considerably between individuals and depend upon personal (e.g., age, adverse childhood experience, attachment style, resilience) and social (e.g. socioeconomic status, family structure) factors. In addition to these traditional factors, the threat imminence (knowing people who had been isolated and the number of currently confirmed cases within their province in the present survey) and public understanding of health-related information approaches and prescriptions may be correlated with negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, if someone they know was quarantined or infected, it may directly make them feel unsafe or insecure, ultimately resulting in negative emotions. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to focus on young adults (university students) and to determine the prevalence of several clinically-relevant mental health outcomes (PTSD, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic growth) and identify potential risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chinese university students. The study might help health-care providers and communities better prepare for their response to this and similar public health emergencies.\nMethods\nStudy Participants\nData for the present study were collected on 12-17 February 2020, namely, around one month after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. Participants were recruited from more than 180 universities in China, covering a wide range of disciplines, including science, engineering, education, law, and literature. When the students participated in the survey, their locations were distributed across 29 provinces and cities of China. Prior to filling out several self-reported questionnaires, all volunteers had signed the online consent forms. In total, 2,126 students initially participated in the survey; after the exclusion of 88 individuals with missing response and incomplete responses, data on 2,038 students remained for analysis (95.9%).\nProcedure\nThe survey was conducted online for both convenience and safety reasons in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. Over a period of 6 days, students were invited to participate in the survey via Tencent's QQ, WeChat, Weibo, and college-related websites (such as university association websites and bulletin board system forums). Participants who had completed all questionnaires that took around 15 min were given ten RMB via online payment (equivalent to 1.5 U.S. dollars at the current rate). Recruitment and data collection procedures were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (No:2020005) of Shenzhen University.\nMeasurement\nDependent Variables\nZung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS)\nSymptoms of anxiety were assessed using the Z-SAS, a 20-item self-report questionnaire. The Z-SAS includes measures of state and trait anxiety based on scoring in four groups of manifestations: cognitive, autonomic, motor, and central nervous system symptoms. Responses to each item range from 1 (a little of the time) to 4 (most of the time) with higher scores indicating increased levels of anxiety. Standard scores above 50 (including 50) as a cut-off point suggest clinically significant anxiety.\nPatient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)\nPHQ-9 was adopted to assess participants' symptoms of depression during the last 7 days. The PHQ-9 uses the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria to assess depressive symptomatology (i.e., sleep, concentration, and energy problems, low self-esteem, anhedonia, etc.) on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Individuals with the PHQ-9 scores of 10 or above were classified as having depressive symptoms. In addition to its utility as a short screener, the PHQ-9 also captures depression severity. Overall scale scores are computed as a sum of the nine items, with the higher scores indicating the higher level of depressive symptoms.\nThe Abbreviated PTSD Checklist (PCL)\nPTSD symptoms were assessed using the abbreviated PTSD Checklist (PCL), which has six items corresponding to each symptom. Responses to each item on the PCL-C were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) indicating the degree to which a respondent had experienced a particular symptom over the previous month. The sum of the response scores was calculated, with higher scores indicating a higher level of PTSD symptoms. A cut-off score of 14 and over was used to define having PTSD symptoms.\nThe PostTraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI)\nThe PIGI was utilized to assess positive self-reported experience of individuals who have experienced traumatic events. When the original version was adapted to be used in China, psychometric properties were good, with the internal consistency reliability of 0.95 for the culture-specific inventory and of 0.81-0.88 for four dimensions. The PIGI consists of 21 items across five dimensions, including relationship to others (seven items), new possibilities (five items), personal strength (four items), spiritual change (two items), and appreciation of life (three items). Two previous studies had indicated that the dimensions on religious beliefs and spiritual change do not fit into the Chinese culture. Therefore, we excluded these two items from the questionnaire we used in our study. Participants responded on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (no change) to 5 (complete change) and could obtain a total score ranging from zero to 95, with higher scores representing higher levels of posttraumatic growth (PTG). Participants who scored above 57 (include 57) were considered to have posttrauma growth (PTG) symptoms, as recommended by a previous research.\nIndependent Variables\nSociodemographic Correlates\nParticipants were invited to report on their age, gender (0 = male; 1 = female), family structure (0 = an intact family; 1 = non-intact family), their current location (1 = Wuhan city; 2 = Hubei province except for Wuhan; 3 = Other areas except for Hubei province), Further, in order to examine whether risk level response to the COVID-19 outbreak was related to individuals' mental health status, information on whether they knew people who had been isolated for this outbreak (0 = yes; 1 = no) and the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia (range from 56,249 to 48) on the days the respondents completed the questionnaires was obtained from the National Health Commission. Above 1,000 (included 1,000) confirmed patients were coded as 1 and below 1,000 were coded as 0.\nThe Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Questionnaire\nThe ACE was used to assess the adverse experiences of participants in the first 18 years of life. It contained 29 items within ten aspects: emotional abuse (two items; any respond is often or very frequent, coded as 1), physical abuse (two items; if the answer of the first item is often or very frequent, or the answer of the second item is sometimes, often, or very frequent, coded as 1), sexual abuse (four items; either answer is yes, coded as 1), emotional neglect (five items; if the total score of these five questions is &gt;=15, coded as 1), physical neglect (five items; if the total score of these five questions is &gt;=10, coded as 1), domestic violence (four items; either answer is sometimes, often or very frequent of the first two relevant questions, or the answer is one or two times, sometimes, often, very often in the last two items, coded as 1), household substance abuse (two items; either answer is yes, coded as 1), mental illness in the household (three items; either answer is yes, coded as 1), parental separation/divorce (one item; if the answer is yes, coded as 1), and criminal household member (one item; if the answer is yes, coded as 1). A total score of ACEs questionnaire summarized 10 dimension score and ranged from 0 to 10, with higher scores representing higher levels.\nThe Adult Attachment Scale (AAS)\nThe 18-item AAS was used to measure adult attachment. In this scale, there are three attachment dimensions that are associated with anxiety and avoidance. Specifically, anxiety refers to a person who is worried about being abandoned, unloved, and rejected. Avoidance involves two conditions: (1) an individual is comfortable with closeness and intimacy; (2) an individual feels that people can be relied on to be available when needed. All items were responded using 5-point scales (1 = &quot;not at all characteristic of me&quot; and 5 = &quot;very characteristic of me&quot;). After reversing the related items, a total score of anxious attachment and avoidant attachment subscale ranged from 6 to 30, and 12-60, respectively, with higher scores indicating higher levels of insecure attachment.\nThe Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)\nResilience was assessed using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, which reflects the ability to tolerate experiences related to change, personal problems, illness, pressure, failure, and painful perception. The original version was adapted by Chinese scholars, with good reliability and validity that were reported. This adapted scale consisted of 10 items in which participants needed to respond using a 5-point Likert scale (0 = not true at all and 4 = true nearly all the time). The final scores can be obtained by adding up the responses (value) of all items ranging from 10 to 50, with higher total scores indicating higher resilience capacity.\nThe Subjective Socioeconomic Status (SES) Scale\nThe widely used subjective SES scale was adopted to assess the subjective social status of participants. Participants were given a drawing of a ladder with 10 rungs that was described as follows: &quot;Think of this ladder as representing where people stand in our society. At the top of the ladder are the people who are the best off, those who have the most money, most education, and the best jobs. At the bottom are the people who are the worst off, those who have the least money, least education, and worst jobs or no job.&quot; They were then asked to place an X on the rung that best represents where they think their families stand on the ladder.\nStatistical Analyses\nFirstly, we described the data (predictors and primary and secondary outcomes) using means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. We then tested the internal reliability of the survey using Cronbach's alpha across the Adverse Childhood Experiences questionnaire, The Adult Attachment Scale with anxious and avoidant attachment subscale, The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, abbreviated PTSD Checklist (PCL), the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and The Post Traumatic Growth Inventory. Secondly, we reported the proportion of clinically relevant outcomes employing current recommendations for cut-off score for detecting clinically relevant levels of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and PTG (14, 50, 10, and 57, respectively). Thirdly, we explored the association between predictors and primary and secondary outcomes, using RIDGE regression. In RIDGE regression a penalizing factor is employed to reduce model complexity and prevent over-fitting which may result from simple linear regression. The penalty is equivalent to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. Using RIDGE regression, it is possible to have an idea of the importance of predictors by sorting the absolute values of coefficients (the most important predictor has the highest absolute value of coefficients). Among the predictors we considered were: age, sex, family structure, SES, knowing people who had been isolated, current location, and the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in each local area, ACEs, attachment type, resilience. All analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, version 23.0) with p &lt; 0.05 being set as a statistical significance (two-tailed).\nResults\nCharacteristics of Participants\nParticipants' information is detailed in  Table 1 , including levels of ACEs (1.30 +- 1.72), anxious attachment (17.05 +- 5.10) and avoidant attachment (31.75 +- 6.00), and resilience (35.45 +- 6.62). Reliabilities of ACEs, anxious attachment and avoidant attachment subscale, and resilience were 0.73, 0.86, 0.73, and 0.92, respectively. The mean age of participants was 20.6 (SD 1.90), and sixty-three percent of the included participants were female. Of the respondents, 91.2% were from intact families and the mean score of the subjective SES was 4.85 (SD 1.37). Regarding COVID-19 data, 12.1% indicated knowing people (family members, relatives and/or friends) who had been isolated, and on the day of data collection, 58.2% respondents were located in areas with &gt;1,000 confirmed cases.\nCharacteristics of participants (N = 2,038).\n	Mean/N	SD/%	Cronbach's a	 	Age	20.56	1.90		 	Sex				 	Male	755	37.0		 	Female	1,283	63.0		 	Family intactness				 	Intactness	1,859	91.2		 	Non-intactness	179	8.8		 	Subjective SES	4.85	1.37		 	Knowing people who have been isolated for this outbreak				 	Yes	247	12.1		 	No	1,791	87.9		 	Number of confirmed patients in participants' area				 	&gt;=1000	1,187	58.2		 	&lt;1000	851	41.8		 	ACEs	1.30	1.72	0.73	 	Anxious attachment	17.05	5.10	0.86	 	Avoidant attachment	31.75	6.00	0.73	 	Resilience	35.45	6.62	0.92	 	\nSex: 0 = male; 1 = female; Family intactness: 0 = Intactness; 1 = Non-intactness; Knowing people who have been isolated for this outbreak: 0 = yes; 1 = no; Number of confirmed patients in participants' area: 0 &lt; 1,000; 1 &gt;= 1,000; Subjective SES, Subjective Socioeconomic status; ACEs, Adverse Child Experiences; Anxious attachment and Avoidant attachment, the two dimensions of Adult Attachment Scale.\nPrevalence of Clinically-Relevant PTSD, Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms, and PTG\nSeverity of PTSD symptoms (11.79 +- 4.25), anxiety symptoms (40.88 +- 8.48), depressive symptoms (6.37+- 4.85), and levels of PTG (60.99 +- 16.96) is presented in  Figure 1 . Cronbach alphas reflected a good internal reliability of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and PTG domain with.81,.82,.86, and.95, respectively. With respect to prevalence of clinically-relevant symptoms, 30.8% (95%CI: 28.8 to 32.8%) of the individuals completing the survey presented clinically relevant PTSD symptoms, 15.5% (95%CI: 13.5 to 16.6%) anxiety, 23.3% (95%CI: 21.5 to 25.1%) depressive symptoms, and 66.9% (95%CI: 65.1 to 69.2%) of the subjects were considered to have PTG. In addition, a significant proportion presented co-existing clinically-relevant symptoms: 4.1% (95%CI: 3.2 to 4.9%) displayed symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety simultaneously and 7.0% (95%CI: 6.0 to 8.2%) respectively presented symptoms of two conditions simultaneously ( Figure 1 ), suggesting a highly vulnerable subgroup of individuals who develop multiple co-morbid symptoms.\nPrevalence of clinically relevant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depressive symptoms and levels of post traumatic growth (PTG).\nCorrelates of Primary Outcome (PTSD Symptoms)\nResults indicated that the regression model was significant (p &lt; 0.001), with 10 independent variables together explaining about 13% of variance in PTSD symptoms. Specifically, older age (beta = 0.02, p &lt; 0.001), knowing people who had been isolated (beta = -0.09, p &lt; 0.001) were found to significantly predict a higher likelihood of reporting PTSD symptoms; more ACEs (beta = 0.06, p = 0.005), higher level of anxious attachment (beta = .18, p &lt; 0.001), and lower level of resilience (beta = -0.21, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with a higher probability of reporting PTSD symptoms ( Table 2 ).\nRIDGE regression of predictors on the primary outcome (PTSD).\nPredictors 	PTSD	 		B	beta	t	DeltaR2	 					0.130***	 	Age	.18	.08	4.29***		 	Sex	-.004	-.0004	-.02		 	Family intactness	.19	.01	.47		 	Subjective SES	.09	.03	1.47		 	Knowing people who have been isolated for this outbreak?	-1.17	-.09	-4.78***		 	Number of confirmed patients in participants' area	.27	.03	1.69		 	ACEs	.14	.06	2.77**		 	Anxious attachment	.15	.18	8.29***		 	Avoidant attachment	-.01	-.02	-.86		 	Resilience	-.13	-.21	-10.31***		 	\nPTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder; *p &lt; .05, **p &lt; .01, ***p &lt; .001.\nCorrelates of Secondary Outcomes (Anxious and Depressive Symptoms and PTG Levels)\nFirstly, the results found that the regression model was significant (p &lt; 0.001), with 10 independent variables together explaining about 29.5% of variance in anxiety symptoms. Specifically, knowing people who had been isolated (beta = -0.04, p = 0.008), more ACEs (beta = 0.15, p &lt; 0.001), higher level of anxious attachment (beta = 0.17, p &lt; 0.001) and avoidant attachment (beta = 0.05, p = 0.005), and lower level of resilience (beta =-0.34, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with greater probability of developing anxiety symptoms. Secondly, the results indicated that the regression model was significant (p &lt; 0.001), with 10 independent variables together explaining about 21.7% of variance in depressive symptoms. Specifically, older age (beta = 0.04, p = 0.03), knowing people who had been isolated (beta = -0.06, p &lt; 0.001), more ACEs (beta = 0.12, p &lt; 0.001), higher level of anxious attachment (beta = 0.24, p &lt; 0.001), and lower level of resilience (beta = -0.22, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with greater probability of reporting depressive symptoms. Thirdly, the results indicated that the regression model was also significant (p &lt; 0.001), with 10 independent variables together explaining about 18.3% of variance in PTG level. Specifically, when analyzing predictors of PTG levels, higher subjective SES (beta = 0.09, p &lt; 0.001), knowing people who had been isolated (beta = -0.04, p = 0.03), and the number of confirmed cases in participants' areas (beta = -3.99, p &lt; 0.001), fewer ACEs (beta = -0.07, p = 0.002), lower level of avoidant attachment (beta = -0.20, p &lt; 0.001), and higher level of resilience (beta = 0.23, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with the higher level of PTG. Such detailed results are presented in  Table 3 .\nRIDGE regression of predictors on the secondary outcomes (Anxiety symptoms, Depressive symptoms, PTG).\nIndependent variables	Anxiety symptoms 	Depressive symptoms 	PTG	 		B	beta	T	DeltaR2	B	beta	t	DeltaR2	B	beta	t	DeltaR2	 					0.295***				0.217***				0.183***	 	Age	.13	.00	.05		.10	.04	2.16*		.25	.03	1.51		 	Sex	-.06	.03	1.71		.10	.01	.58		-.76	-.02	-1.17		 	Family intactness	-.30	-	-		-.22	-.01	-.68		.80	1.13	.71		 	Subjective SES	-.19	-.03	-1.80		-.02	-.01	-.31		1.05	.09	4.62***		 	Knowing people who havebeen isolated for this outbreak?	-1.16	-.04	-2.63**		-.94	-.06	-3.56***		-2.01	-.04	-2.12*		 	Number of confirmed patients in participants' area	.05	.003	.16		.29	.03	1.60		-2.55	-.07	-3.99***		 	ACEs	.73	.15	8.09***		.33	.12	6.09***		-.65	-.07	-3.35***		 	Anxious attachment	.28	.17	8.54***		.23	.24	11.53***		.04	.01	.64		 	Avoidant attachment	.08	.05	2.83**		.02	.02	1.03		-.58	-.20	-9.80***		 	Resilience	-.43	-.34	-18.83***		-.16	-.22	-11.84***		.59	.23	12.00***		 	\nPTG, posttraumatic growth; *p &lt; .05, **p &lt; .01, ***p &lt; .0.\nDiscussion\nThe present study showed high prevalence rates of PTSD, anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as PTG among Chinese university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also identified specific risk factors for poor mental health outcomes during stressful COVID-19 pandemic. Prevalence rates of PTSD and PTG symptoms (30.8 or 66.9%, respectively) were comparable with those observed after the Sichuan earthquake which caused 69,227 deaths and 374,643 injuries in 2008. On one hand, college students have traumatic experiences and present some negative mental health effects during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, personal growth reflects that individuals have intrinsic motivation for positive growth and will seek to implement effective ways to cope with trauma and adversity.\nRates of anxiety symptoms (15%) was lower than those in a similar study conducted by Chang et al. that focused on 3,881 college students who were specifically selected from universities located in Guangdong province (26.6%). The higher percentage in that study may be due to the use of a different instrument (the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder) with different cut-offs or the fact that it was conducted earlier (between January 31, 2019 and February 3, 2020). The study was conducted one week after confirming person-to-person transmission of the COVID-19, which has increased anxiety.\nRates of depressive symptoms (23.3%) matched those (21.16%) estimated in a previous study. Also, two concomitant symptomatic dimensions among anxiety, depressive, and posttraumatic symptoms affected 4.1% of participants and two of them in 7.0%, confirming previous findings outside of COVID-19 context. Such comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety, and PTSD) may lead to increased risk of developing chronic mental disorder relative to depression or anxiety presence alone, and so this unique group needs special attention.\nA number of socio-demographic risk factors identified subjects with poor mental health. Higher age might be associated with more PTSD and depressive symptoms. Individually, the positive association between age and PTSD symptoms may be attributed to the fact that older students are about to experience job search competition while working on their thesis as a part of the requirements in order to successfully obtain their undergraduate degrees in China's higher education. This result can also be partially explained by the fact that some of the juniors and seniors may be preparing for the graduate school entrance examination. The aforementioned behavior, to a large extent, causes more stress relative to those freshmen and sophomores, which may ultimately lead to higher level of PTSD and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, higher subjective SES may predict a higher level of PTG, which is strongly supported by previous studies. Such results may arise from students with higher SES being more likely to get access to safe settings, to afford masks and health equipment, and to receive food support, which may help them effectively cope with stressful events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowing people who had been isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. It may be due to the fact that knowing someone close had been quarantined might have increased the sensation of being vulnerable. When someone we know is isolated, we become more empathetic so that naturally we think of ourselves, and then it is easy to become tense, or if the isolated person has been in contact with us before, we are even more worried about whether we will be infected. This kind of pandemic fear may cause more negative psychological feelings such as anxiety and PTSD symptoms. Finally, participants living in areas with a higher number of confirmed cases reported lower levels of PTG, which can be attributed to that the greater number of confirmed cases makes them feel having greater possibility to be infected as they are exposed to more dangerous area. Timely mental health services should be offered in those areas with a higher number of affected people. Surprisingly, the number of participant-based confirmed cases was not significantly predictive of negative emotions in this study. Since our survey was conducted in mid to late February which was one and half month after the initially identified outbreak, college students had a sufficient amount of time to adapt to such stressful environment and learn how to effectively manage their negative emotion as usual, or their negative emotion has reached a plateau.\nConsidering psychological factors, students who reported more ACEs, higher levels of insecure attachment, especially anxious attachment, and lower levels of resilience reported significantly higher level of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, whereas fewer ACEs, a lower level of avoidant attachment, and a higher level of resilience significantly predicted an increased likelihood of achieving PTG. These results replicate findings from several previous studies. Specifically, overarching biopsychosocial psychopathology models emphasize that negative life events, particularly those occurring during sensitive developmental periods such as adverse childhood experiences, play a major etiologic role in precipitating and/or exacerbating psychological disorder in later life, and that attachment determines adult internal and external thought and behavior schemata. Individuals who score high on the Attachment-Anxiety dimension tend to intensify negative emotional states (hyper-activation strategies), whereas those with high scores on the Attachment-Avoidant dimension tend to distance themselves from emotional situations (deactivation strategies), avoid developing closes relationship, and consequently may be less sensitive to stress. In addition, resilience was observed to be a strong protective factor against mental health problems and promoted PTG, which is supported by previous research. Resilience, reflecting problem-solving ability or positive adaptation, is an individual's ability to overcome adversities with positive emotions. It may enhance individuals' understanding of happiness and promote psychological health. It indicates that under the current situation individuals with high resilience presented a &quot;mental immunity,&quot; which allows them to resist the psychosocial influences of major events. Resilience should be promoted in university students as it can reduce their psychiatric symptoms and improve their PTG under stressful situations. It is essential to translate these findings into clinical practice and mental health policy-making. Under the current circumstances online interventions targeting vulnerable populations promoting resilience might be a viable option. More specifically, resilience can be promoted in different ways such as providing a supportive social network, enhancing active coping self-efficacy strategies (e.g., enhancing the perception that one is able to manage or recover from a stressful event), learning mindfulness skills (e.g., deep breath and focusing on the present moment), as well as nurturing a sense of purpose of life and the ability to find meaning in face of COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe findings of the present study need to be considered in the context of several limitations. First, a cross-sectional design and corresponding measures before COVID-19 outbreak were not available, thus limiting any causal interpretation. Extending this cross-sectional survey to a longitudinal study would help to determine the developmental trajectory of mental health outcomes and predictors throughout the COVID-19 epidemic. Second, our participants were mainly from Guangdong, Anhui hui, Hebei, and Jiangsu provinces, and the most strongly affected province (Hubei) was very poorly represented (1.6%); thus, the findings may not be generalized to the Hubei province. From a practical perspective, it is particularly difficult to obtain data from college students who were most severely affected or whose family members and relatives are under quarantine/self-isolated or being diagnosed with the COVID-19. Future studies may consider data collection in Hubei province after people recovered from the COVID-19. Third, data on previous histories of mental disorders or treatment were not collected in this study, so it largely remains unknown whether thesenbsp;symptoms are associated with the COVID-19 outbreak or whether they pre-existed. Future studies may include respondents' previous histories of mental disorders or treatment. Finally, self-report instruments were used to detect and screen anxious, depressive and PTSD symptoms, which may be considered less accurate than the rating of a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist. Future studies on this similar topic that additionally includes diagnostic instruments administered by clinical psychologists or psychiatrists are encouraged.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, this study suggests a high prevalence of posttraumatic, anxiety and depressive symptoms, but also that many have an intrinsic motivation for positive growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings may help provide important information for future tracking or intervention research in this group. Specific risk factors exist to identify subjects at risk of poor mental health. While early traumatic events in childhood and insecure attachment are risk factors, resilience is a modifiable factor and a potential therapeutic target to prevent poor mental health outcome during COVID-19 pandemic.\nData Availability Statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nEthics Statement\nRecruitment and data collection procedures were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (No.2020005) of Shenzhen University.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12

patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 2324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·472·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·87·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227805), 113 (57193), 98 (49168), 111 (56191), and 80 (40139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 12 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Serological Study for the Prevalence of Anti-MERS Coronavirus Antibodies in High- and Low-Risk Groups in Qatar","abstract":"Infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could be asymptomatic or cause mild influenza-like illness.\n Therefore, the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in the general population could be underestimated, which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases.\n The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in high- and low-risk groups in Qatar.\n A total of 4858 samples were screened, including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors (BD) over a period of five years (2012-2016), 135 samples from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive PCR-confirmed patients (CP), and four samples from MERS-CoV CP.\n Initial screening using anti-MERS-CoV IgG (IgG rS1-ELISA kit) revealed ten reactive samples from BD (10/4719, 0.21%), one from CC (1/135, 0.74%), and three from CP (3/4, 75%).\n Samples from CP but not from BD were also reactive by whole-virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG (n = 3/4) and IgM (n = 1/4) indirect immunefluorescent tests (IIFT) and pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT).\n The reactive sample from CC was also confirmed by ppNT.\n Surprisingly, one out of thirteen (7.7%) randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA-negative BD samples from the initial screening was reactive by the IgM-IIFT (but not by the IgG-IIFT) and was subsequently confirmed by ppNT.\n All IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples from BD exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63).\n Cross-reactivity with SARS was only reported for samples from CP using IgG and IgM-IIFT.\n In conclusion, we report a low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies in the general population, which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study (2017) in Qatar (n = 21).\n The false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronavirus necessitate more detailed evaluation of available serological assays.\n","id":"PMC6398027","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"Reham

protect or harm left-behind children in China?","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>In China, children under 18 years old who are left at rural residences for at least 6 months by either one or both of their parents migrating to work in cities are called left-behind children (LBC).\n\n Due to restricted family support, they are at a greater risk of developing depressive symptoms than non-left-behind children (NLBC).\n\n The objective of this study is to explore how depressive symptoms and stress induced by negative life events such as interpersonal conflicts, punishment and loss, as well as their relationships vary for LBC with different left-behind-related characteristics.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Using data from a large school-based survey conducted in Chongqing between December 2012 and June 2013, we first identified the differences in depressive symptoms and negative-event-induced stress between LBC and NLBC, and then analyzed the variances among LBC with different left-behind-related characteristics.\n\n The data was analyzed with Chi-square test, MANCOVA, ANCOVA, ANOVA, T-test and hierarchical multiple regression analyses.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>We found that LBC were more stressed when experiencing negative events and had more depressive symptoms than NLBC.\n\n Children left behind by both parents were most depressed.\n\n Negative-event-induced stress and communication on life difficulties with migrant parents were risk factors for depressive symptoms, whereas adequate communication on academic performance or childrens feelings was a protective factor against depressive symptoms.\n\n Communication duration and frequency, communication by visiting, communication on academic performance, life difficulties and childrens feelings moderated the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms, respectively.\n\n Duration of separation, communication duration and frequency, communication on academic performance, learning difficulties and childrens feelings moderated the relation between the type of parental migration and depressive symptoms, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Our findings suggest that children left behind by both parents should be the focus of public attention for their higher susceptibility to stress-related depression.\n\n To help LBC stay mentally healthy, governments need to formulate regulations contributing to LBCs family reunion, communities need to involve more residents to attend LBC as surrogate parents and teach migrant parents to communicate with LBC properly, and schools need to teach LBC how to deal with stress and communicate with migrant parents.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5732424","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 2024 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern","abstract":"","id":"PMC7135038","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"cyh-birm@263.net","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter W","surname":"Horby","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick G","surname":"Hayden","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1007.030703","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS Control and Psychological Effects of Quarantine, Toronto, Canada","abstract":"Explores effects of quarantine on those quarantined for SARS, Toronto, Canada","id":"PMC3323345","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Hawryluck","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wayne L.","surname":"Gold","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Robinson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Pogorski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sandro","surname":"Galea","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rima","surname":"Styra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/jcm9020330","date":"2020-01-23","title":"The Extent of Transmission of Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, 2020","abstract":"A cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported by China in late December 2019.

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth.\n The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation.\n We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0.\n Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.\n The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 1825) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.\n We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.492.63).\n Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.\n","id":"PMC7074332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Shi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinjun","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangpu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daozhou","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel CoronavirusInfected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died

to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nWhen an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered.\n\n Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities.\n\n The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities.\n At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down.\n It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities.\n Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma.\n The severity of this epidemic and its long-lasting repercussions

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire.\n\n Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access.\n\n\nIn addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6).\n\n The total Impact of Event ScaleRevised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n The perceived dangerous Pollutant

Participants were recruited by an online recruitment post and snowball sampling techniques.\n\n Participants were required to complete an online survey which was composed of demographics questionnaire, physical symptom checklist, perceived dangerous Pollutant Standard Index (PSI) value and views on the N-95 mask and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R).\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 participants returned the completed study questionnaire.\n\n The respondents reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (S.\n\nD.\n\n = 2.6).\n\n The five most common physical symptoms include mouth or throat discomfort (68.8%), nose discomfort (64.1%), eye discomfort (60.7%), headache (50.3%) and breathing difficulty (40.3%).\n\n The total IES-R score was 18.47 (S.\n\nD.\n\n =

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)-based Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) instrument to the developmental epidemiology research in Norway, by examining depressive symptoms in a school sample of adolescents (N = 846).\n The average PHQ-9 scores were 6.89 (SD = 5.13) for girls, and 4.57 (SD = 3.98) for boys; 8.5% of girls and 2.6% of boys were classified into the originally proposed categories indicative of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; PHQ-9 scores ? 15).\n Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed a single-factor structure for the PHQ-9 with solid psychometric properties and high internal consistency for both genders.\n However, even though configural equality was observed, there was no evidence for metric or scalar equality across genders, warranting further investigation of measurement equivalence for the current Norwegian version of the PHQ-9. We observed no major associations between the PHQ-9 scores and adolescent religion or immigrant background.\n Further, school grade, not living together with both biological parents, and diagnosed chronic illness were differently associated with elevated depressive symptoms for boys and girls.\n Finally, high residential instability, perceived low SES, school dissatisfaction, lack of close friendships, history of suicide attempts and self-harm, and elevated emotional problems were all significantly and consistently associated with greater depression for both genders.\n Overall, the PHQ-9 appears to be a promising research tool, potentially offering clinically-relevant classification of adolescent self-reported depressive symptomatology in addition to the symptom severity captured by continuous scores.\n Nevertheless, further investigation concerning the observed measurement non-equivalence, as well as the comprehensive validation and comparison against the gold standard is required before the PHQ-9 is to be used for diagnostic screening in Norway.\n","id":"PMC5462997","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasmina","surname":"Burdzovic Andreas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Geir S.","surname":"Brunborg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1177/1403494815604764","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Municipal-level differences in depressive symptoms among adolescents in Norway: results from the cross-national Ungdata study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s10903-012-9745-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"What we know and don't know about mental health problems among immigrants in Norway","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jad.2006.05.021","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Validity of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) as a screening tool for depression amongst Nigerian university students","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1002/da.21971","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Screening for depression in adolescents: validity of the Patient Health Questionnaire in pediatric care","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The development of a short questionnaire for use in epidemiological studies of depression in children and adolescents","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/00004583-199611000-00011","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Childhood and adolescent depression: a review of the past 10 years.

treatment capacity.\n\n The aim of this study was to examine the usefulness of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) with the original UK scoring algorithms, when used as a screening instrument to detect mental health disorders among patients in the Norwegian Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) North Study.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 286 outpatients, aged 5 to 18 years, from the CAMHS North Study were assigned diagnoses based on a Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA).\n\n The main diagnostic groups (emotional, hyperactivity, conduct and other disorders) were then compared to the SDQ scoring algorithms using two dichotomisation levels: 'possible' and 'probable' levels.\n\n Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio (ORD) were calculated.\n\n\nResults\nSensitivity for the diagnostic categories included was 0.47-0.85 ('probable' dichotomisation level) and 0.81-1.00 ('possible' dichotomisation level).\n\n Specificity was 0.52-0.87 ('probable' level) and 0.24-0.58 ('possible' level).\n\n The discriminative ability, as measured by ORD, was in the interval for potentially useful tests for hyperactivity disorders and conduct disorders when dichotomised on the 'possible' level.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe usefulness of the SDQ UK-based scoring algorithms in detecting mental health disorders among patients in the CAMHS North Study is only partly supported in the present study.\n\n They seem best suited to identify children and adolescents who do not require further psychiatric evaluation, although this as well is problematic from a clinical point of

essential unidimensionality of SMFQ.\n However, the items with the highest loadings according to the bifactor analysis, reflecting problems related to tiredness, restlessness and concentration difficulties, indicated that some of the symptoms may both be independent of and part of the symptomatology of depression.\n Measurement invariance analysis showed that girls scored slightly higher on some items when taking the latent variable into account; girls had a lower threshold for reporting mood problems and problems related to tiredness than boys, who showed a marginally lower threshold for reporting that no-one loved them.\n However, the effect on the total SMFQ score was marginal, supporting the use of the Norwegian translation of SMFQ as a continuous variable in further studies of adolescents.\n","id":"PMC3769622","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Astri

prevalence and characteristics of adolescent Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Dysthymia and Depression NOS among adolescents in Central Norway in addition to socio-demographics and use of mental health care.\n\n\nMethod\nIn the Youth and Mental Health Study a representative sample of 2432 junior high school students (mean age 14.9 years, SD = 0.6) from two counties in Central Norway were screened with the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ).\n\n A subset of 345 of these adolescents (72.5% girls), 220 high scorers (MFQ = &gt; 26), 74 middle scorers (MFQ 7-25), and 50 low scorers (MFQ &lt; 7), 1 unknown score, were drawn and interviewed with the Kiddie SADS-PL (Present-Life Version).\n\n In all, 79% had parental interviews as well.\n\n All estimates of prevalence rates and population shares were weighted back using a sandwich estimator to yield true population estimates.\n\n\nResults\nAlmost one in four subjects (23%) had life-time depression.\n\n Prevalences of current Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Dysthymia and 'Double depression' were 2.6%, 1.0% and 0.6%, respectively, and for Depression NOS 6.3%.\n\n\nConclusion\nHigh rates of Depression NOS, early onset of depressive episodes, long duration, and low use of specialized services point to the need for improved diagnostic assessment and treatment for young individuals.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3215923","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Anne

at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis.\n\n These comorbid disorders affected the baseline functional level of CHR patients.\n\n However, little is known about the comorbid mental disorder in CHR individuals in non-clinical adolescent population.\n\n This study aimed to investigate the comorbid mental disorder in non-clinical CHR adolescents and the impact on attenuated psychosis symptoms (APS) as well as clinical outcome.\n\n\nMethods\nThe sample consisted of 32 CHR students, who were screened from 2,800 university students.\n\n CHR status was evaluated with the Structured Interview of Prodromal Syndromes, comorbid mental disorder diagnoses with the International Neuropsychiatric Interview.\n\n\nResults\nIn the CHR sample, 46.9% was found at least one non-psychotic comorbid mental disorder.\n\n The CHR participants presenting comorbid mental disorder had significantly more severity of APS than those without comorbid mental disorders, and the remission rate at 6-month follow-up is significantly higher in the individuals without comorbid mental disorders at baseline.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn the non-clinical sample of individuals at CHR, non-psychotic comorbid mental disorders are common and anxiety disorder is most frequent.\n\n Copresence of anxiety and/or depression is related to higher level of attenuated psychotic symptoms and unfavorable clinical outcome at

At-Risk Mental State: Impact on Psychopathology and Transition to Psychosis","abstract":"Background: The current diagnostic system for subjects at enhanced clinical risk of psychosis allows concurrent comorbid diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorders.\n Their impact on the presenting high-risk psychopathology, functioning, and transition outcomes has not been widely researched.\n Methods: In a large sample of subjects with an At-Risk Mental State (ARMS, n = 509), we estimated the prevalence of DSM/SCID anxiety or depressive disorders and their impact on psychopathology, functioning, and psychosis transition.\n A meta-analytical review of the literature complemented the analysis.\n Results: About 73% of ARMS subjects had a comorbid axis I diagnosis in addition to the at-risk signs and symptoms.\n About 40% of ARMS subjects had a comorbid diagnosis of depressive disorder while anxiety disorders were less frequent (8%).\n The meta-analysis conducted in 1683 high-risk subjects confirmed that baseline prevalence of comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders is respectively 41% and 15%.\n At a psychopathological level, comorbid diagnoses of anxiety or depression were associated with higher suicidality or self-harm behaviors, disorganized/odd/stigmatizing behavior, and avolition/apathy.\n Comorbid anxiety and depressive diagnoses were also associated with impaired global functioning but had no effect on risk of transition to frank psychosis.\n Meta-regression analyses confirmed no effect of baseline anxiety and/or depressive comorbid diagnoses on transition to psychosis.\n Conclusions: The ARMS patients are characterized by high prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders in addition to their attenuated psychotic symptoms.\n These symptoms may reflect core emotional dysregulation processes and delusional mood in prodromal psychosis.\n Anxiety and depressive symptoms are likely to impact the ongoing psychopathology, the global functioning, and the overall longitudinal outcome of these patients.\n","id":"PMC3885287","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

college students in the United States has not been well-documented.\n\n\nObjective\nThis paper surveys the mental health status and severity of depression and anxiety of college students in a large university system in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nMethods\nAn online survey was conducted among undergraduate and graduate students recruited from Texas A&amp;M University via email.\n\n The survey consisted of two standardized scalesthe Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the General Anxiety Disorder-7for depression and anxiety, and additional multiple-choice and open-ended questions regarding stressors and coping mechanisms specific to COVID-19.\nResults\nAmong the 2031 participants, 48.14% (n=960) showed a moderate-to-severe level of depression, 38.48% (n=775) showed a moderate-to-severe level of anxiety, and 18.04% (n=366) had suicidal thoughts.\n\n A majority of participants (n=1443, 71.26%) indicated that their stress/anxiety levels had increased during the pandemic.\n\n Less than half of the participants (n=882, 43.25%) indicated that they were able to cope adequately with the stress related to the current situation.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe proportion of respondents showing depression, anxiety, and/or suicidal thoughts is alarming.\n\n Respondents reported academic-, health-, and lifestyle-related concerns caused by the pandemic.\n\n Given the unexpected length and severity of the outbreak, these concerns need to be further understood and addressed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7505693","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR

Second, are these behavior and mental health changes associated with the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media?\nMethods\nBehaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife smartphone sensing app.\n\n Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students, with 178 (82.0%) students providing data during the Winter 2020 term.\n\n Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term compared to previous terms in the same cohort were modeled using mixed linear models.\n\n\nResults\nDuring the first academic term impacted by COVID-19 (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P&lt;.\n\n001) relative to previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks.\n\n Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and the week of the academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant.\n\n In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term were strongly associated with increased amount of COVID-19related news.\n\n When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P&lt;.\n\n001) and depression (P=.\n\n03) were significantly associated with COVID-19related news.\n\n\nConclusions\nCompared with prior academic terms, individuals in the Winter 2020 term were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed.\n\n A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, were associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting.\n\n While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods to reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7301687","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR

Augmentation for Defect Detection Using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks","abstract":"Surface defect identification based on computer vision algorithms often leads to inadequate generalization ability due to large intraclass variation.\n Diversity in lighting conditions, noise components, defect size, shape, and position make the problem challenging.\n To solve the problem, this paper develops a pixel-level image augmentation method that is based on image-to-image translation with generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) conditioned on fine-grained labels.\n The GAN model proposed in this work, referred to as Magna-Defect-GAN, is capable of taking control of the image generation process and producing image samples that are highly realistic in terms of variations.\n Firstly, the surface defect dataset based on the magnetic particle inspection (MPI) method is acquired in a controlled environment.\n Then, the Magna-Defect-GAN model is trained, and new synthetic image samples with large intraclass variations are generated.\n These synthetic image samples artificially inflate the training dataset size in terms of intraclass diversity.\n Finally, the enlarged dataset is used to train a defect identification model.\n Experimental results demonstrate that the Magna-Defect-GAN model can generate realistic and high-resolution surface defect images up to the resolution of 512 × 512 in a controlled manner.\n We also show that this augmentation method can boost accuracy and be easily adapted to any other surface defect identification models.\n","id":"PMC9967620","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Vignesh","surname":"Sampath","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Iñaki","surname":"Maurtua","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juan

Predicts Better Emotional Recovery from Negative Stimuli","abstract":"Purpose in life predicts both health and longevity suggesting that the ability to find meaning from lifes experiences, especially when confronting lifes challenges, may be a mechanism underlying resilience.\n Having purpose in life may motivate reframing stressful situations to deal with them more productively, thereby facilitating recovery from stress and trauma.\n In turn, enhanced ability to recover from negative events may allow a person to achieve or maintain a feeling of greater purpose in life over time.\n In a large sample of adults (aged 36-84 years) from the MIDUS study (Midlife in the U.\nS.\n, http://www.\nmidus.\nwisc.\nedu/), we tested whether purpose in life was associated with better emotional recovery following exposure to negative picture stimuli indexed by the magnitude of the eyeblink startle reflex (EBR), a measure sensitive to emotional state.\n We differentiated between initial emotional reactivity (during stimulus presentation) and emotional recovery (occurring after stimulus offset).\n Greater purpose in life, assessed over two years prior, predicted better recovery from negative stimuli indexed by a smaller eyeblink after negative pictures offset, even after controlling for initial reactivity to the stimuli during the picture presentation, gender, age, trait affect, and other well-being dimensions.\n These data suggest a proximal mechanism by which purpose in life may afford protection from negative events and confer resilience is through enhanced automatic emotion regulation after negative emotional provocation.\n","id":"PMC3827458","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Stacey
