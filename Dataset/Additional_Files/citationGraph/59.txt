The disease progression associated with the proinflammatory host response prompted us to examine the role of early corticosteroid therapy in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe conducted a single pretest, single posttest quasi-experiment in a multicenter health system in Michigan from 12 March to 27 March 2020. Adult patients with confirmed moderate to severe COVID were included. A protocol was implemented on 20 March 2020 using early, short-course, methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day divided in 2 intravenous doses for 3 days. Outcomes of standard of care (SOC) and early corticosteroid groups were evaluated, with a primary composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to intensive care unit (ICU), new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up.\nResults\nWe analyzed 213 eligible subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in SOC and early corticosteroid groups, respectively. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in the early corticosteroid group (34.9% vs 54.3%, P = .005). This treatment effect was observed within each individual component of the composite endpoint. Significant reduction in median hospital length of stay was also observed in the early corticosteroid group (5 vs 8 days, P &lt; .001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated an independent reduction in the composite endpoint at 14-days controlling for other factors (adjusted odds ratio: 0.41; 95% confidence interval, .22 - .77). \nConclusions\nAn early short course of methylprednisolone in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 reduced escalation of care and improved clinical outcomes.\nClinical Trials Registration\nNCT04374071.\nIn this multicenter quasi-experimental study of 213 patients, we demonstrate early short course of methylprednisolone in moderate to severe COVID-19 patients reduced the composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to Intensive Care Unit, new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality.\nBACKGROUND\nAs of 9 April 2020, the United States has over 400 000 cases of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most patients will have mild illness, but older persons and those with comorbidities may develop severe disease necessitating hospitalization and time in the intensive care unit (ICU). The disease pathophysiology presents in 2 distinct overlapping phases, the initial pathogenic viral response followed by host inflammatory response with grades of severity associated with distinct clinical findings. The pathological progression in severe COVID-19 includes an excessive and unregulated proinflammatory cytokine storm resulting in immunopathological lung injury, diffuse alveolar damage with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death.\nIn the absence of any proven antiviral therapy, the current clinical management is primarily supportive care, supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilatory support. Adjunctive therapy with immunomodulatory agents targeting the inflammatory cytokine storm are being evaluated. Studies of corticosteroid therapy for phylogenetically similar coronavirus infections showed no benefit and potential harm. Despite the frequent use in treating patients with COVID-19 in China, the role of corticosteroids is undefined. A more recent observational study reported improved outcomes in patients with COVID-associated ARDS that received corticosteroids.\nWe postulated that early treatment with a short course of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 may attenuate the excessive host respiratory and systemic inflammatory responses. We report the clinical characteristics and early outcomes of patients with COVID-19 receiving short courses of methylprednisolone.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nConsecutive patients hospitalized from 12 March 2020 through 27 March 2020 were eligible for inclusion if they were &gt;=18 years, had confirmed COVID-19 infection, with radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and required oxygen by nasal cannula, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), or mechanical ventilation. Patients were excluded if they were transferred from an out-of-system hospital, died within 24 hours of presentation to the emergency department (ED), or were admitted for &lt;24 hours. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a patient that had a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal sample tested by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) or the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) centralized clinical microbiology laboratory. Beginning 16 March 2020, testing for hospitalized patients was performed by the centralized clinical microbiology laboratory.\nPatients were risk stratified by severity of symptoms on presentation to the hospital as mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19. Patients without hypoxia or exertional dyspnea were considered to have mild COVID-19. Patients with mild COVID-19 were treated with symptom relief only and not admitted to the hospital. Patients who presented with infiltrates on chest radiography and required supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or HFNC were classified as having moderate COVID-19. Patients who had respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation were classified as having severe COVID-19.\nStudy Design\nThis was a multicenter quasi-experimental study at HFHS, composed of 5 hospitals in southeast and south-central Michigan. The study was approved by the institution's Investigational Review Board (13739) with waiver of consent. Patients in the standard of care (SOC) group from 12 March 2020 through 19 March 2020 were compared to an early corticosteroid group that included patients from 20 March 2020 through 27 March 2020.\nPatients in both study groups received standard care, composed of supplemental oxygen, HFNC, invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, antiviral agents, vasopressor support, and renal-replacement therapy, as determined by the primary team. Patients who progressed to ARDS were managed with SOC.\nIntervention Standard of Care\nPatients with moderate or severe disease who presented to HFHS within the first week of the COVID epidemic in Detroit were initially treated with supportive care with or without a combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin or hydroxychloroquine according an institutional guideline developed by Infectious Diseases Physicians and Pharmacists. The institutional guidelines were developed by consensus, and based on the available literature, experience from Wuhan, China, and other centers around the world affected by COVID-19 before Michigan. Intravenous (IV) remdesivir compassionate use was requested for eligible mechanically ventilated patients. On 17 March 2020 lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin was removed from the COVID-19 institutional protocol. Steroids were considered on a case-by-case basis.\nEarly Corticosteroid Group\nAs a result of observed poor outcomes, clinical rationale based on immunology, clinical course of COVID-19, and more recently best available evidence, the HFHS early corticosteroid protocol was developed (Supplementary Materials). We hypothesized that early corticosteroids would combat the inflammatory cascade leading to respiratory failure, ICU escalation of care, and mechanical ventilation. The early corticosteroid protocol was incorporated in the institutional COVID-19 guidelines on 20 March 2020. Patients with confirmed influenza infection were not recommended to receive early corticosteroids. The decision to prescribe hydroxychloroquine and early corticosteroids was at the discretion of the primary medical team.\nModerate COVID-19 was treated with hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily for 2 doses on day 1, followed by 200 mg twice daily on days 2-5. Patients with moderate COVID-19 who required 4 liters or more of oxygen per minute on admission, or who had escalating oxygen requirements from baseline, were recommended to receive IV methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 3 days. Patients who required ICU admission were recommended to receive the above regimen of hydroxychloroquine and IV methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 3-7 days. ICU patients were also evaluated for tocilizumab on a case-by-case basis. Oral switch was performed to prednisone at a ratio of 1 to 1 when determined clinically appropriate by the primary medical team.\nData Collection\nData were ascertained from each institution's electronic medical record and recorded in a standardized electronic case report form. Demographic data, information on clinical symptoms or signs at presentation, and laboratory and radiologic results during admission were collected. All laboratory tests and radiologic assessments, including plain chest radiography and computed tomography of the chest, were performed at the discretion of the treating physician.\nStudy Definitions\nWe ascertained coexisting conditions from electronic medical record and physician documentation. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was collected to evaluate baseline illness severity based on vital signs obtained in the ED. Additionally, the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment was used to evaluate severity of illness of included patients based on ED vitals and examination. All patients were followed for at least 14 days after initial presentation. Patient data were censored on 9 April 2020.\nOUTCOME MEASURES\nPrimary Endpoint\nThe primary composite endpoint was escalation to an ICU from a general medical unit, progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation after hospital admission, or in-hospital all-cause mortality. Patients directly admitted to the ICU from the emergency room were evaluated for the latter 2 outcomes, and those requiring mechanical ventilation in the emergency room were evaluated for mortality.\nSecondary Endpoints\nSecondary endpoints included development and severity of ARDS, days to ventilator liberation, shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), and length of hospital stay (LOS). LOS was reported only for patients who were discharged alive within the 14-day minimum follow-up period. ARDS was diagnosed and classified according to the Berlin definition. AKI was diagnosed according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition.\nStatistical Analysis\nContinuous variables were reported as median and interquartile range (IQR) and compared using the Mann-Whitney test or t-test, as appropriate. Categorical data were reported as number and percentage (no., %) and compared using the chi 2 test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. No imputation was made for missing data points. The sample size was derived from all eligible consecutive hospitalized patients during the study period. A 2-sided alpha &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was planned a priori to test the association between the composite endpoint and exposure to the corticosteroid protocol. Covariates in the bivariate analysis with a P-value &lt;.2 and clinical rationale were included in a multivariable regression model that was restricted to a subject-to-variable ratio of 10:1. To evaluate the implementation timing of the in-house RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing a post hoc sensitivity analysis were conducted on the composite outcome. A nonequivalent dependent variable, receipt of, and time to empiric antibiotic therapy for pneumonia, was utilized to account for potential maturation in the management of COVID-19. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 25 (Chicago, IL) and SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).\nRESULTS\nTwo-hundred and fifty consecutive patients were evaluated for inclusion. Ten were hospitalized for &lt;=24 hours, 23 did not require oxygen by nasal cannula, HFNC, or mechanical ventilation, and 4 expired within 24 hours of admission (Figure 1). Two-hundred and thirteen patients were included, 81 (38%) in the SOC group and 132 (62%) in the early corticosteroid group. The median age of the SOC group and early corticosteroid group was 64 (IQR: 51.5, 73.5) and 61 (IQR: 51, 72) years, respectively. Black patients comprised 61.7% of the SOC group and 79.5% of the early corticosteroid group (P = .005). Of the comorbid conditions evaluated, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was more frequent in the SOC group compared to the early corticosteroid group (18.5% vs 9.1%; P = .045). The presenting COVID-19 symptoms, baseline severity of illness, and other demographics are presented in Table 1. One patient had a concomitant influenza infection in the early corticosteroid group.\nNumber of patients screened and included in the trial.\nBaseline Demographics and Clinical Characteristics of Study Patients\nCharacteristics	Total 	 	(n = 213)	SOC (n = 81)	Early CG (n = 132)	P value	 	Demographics					 	 Median age (IQR), y	62 (51-62)	64 (51.5-3.5)	61 (51-72)	.400	 	 Male sex, no.

ARDS occurred in 38.3% and 26.6% in the SOC group and early corticosteroid group, respectively (P = .04). Outcomes at 14 days also included 9 (11.1%) of SOC patients remaining admitted as compared to 26 (19.7%) of early corticosteroid patients. Table 3 describes additional outcomes before and after implementation of the early corticosteroid protocol.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this quasi-experimental study, hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 that received an early short course of methylprednisolone had a reduced rate of the primary composite endpoint of death, ICU transfer, and mechanical ventilation, with a number needed to treat of 8 to prevent 1 patient transfer for mechanical ventilation. The reduction in ICU transfer and requirement for mechanical ventilation represents a potential intervention to reduce critical care utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic. The median reduction of hospital LOS by 3 days observed with the use of corticosteroids could positively impact hospital capacity during the COVID-19 surge.\nCorticosteroids are not routinely recommended in patients with COVID-19 without an alternate indication or presence of ARDS. Data are conflicting; corticosteroid use in previous viral respiratory illnesses has demonstrated delayed viral clearance and increased mortality. On the contrary, short-course corticosteroids in some reports are beneficial and safe in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 and were not found to be an independent risk factor of prolonged viral RNA shedding. These discordant findings may be explained by the observational nature of the studies, heterogeneity in patient acuity, inconsistent dosing regimens and duration, and timing of initiation of therapy. Corticosteroids were used in 11-35% of nonsevere and 45-72% of severe COVID-19 cases in China; however, the benefits and risks remain undefined. A mortality benefit (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, .20-.72) with the use of methylprednisolone was reported in 1 retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients with ARDS.\nCOVID-19 can progress from mild to severe illness characterized by an initial viral infection phase followed by pulmonary inflammation, and then a hyper-inflammation phase. The pulmonary phase is associated with progressive dyspnea and radiographic findings of pneumonia. Symptom onset to dyspnea and ARDS development occurs between a median of 5-7 days and 8-12 days, respectively. The present study findings support that timing is key. An early course of corticosteroid, specifically methylprednisolone, at the onset of dyspnea, may attenuate progression to the hyper-inflammation phase that requires escalation of care in patients with COVID-19. In this study, 3 days of early corticosteroids were administered at a median 2 days into hospitalization and 8 days from symptom onset. However, the administration of a 3-day course of corticosteroids later in the disease course (median 5 days after hospitalization), as occurred in our SOC group, did not appear to confer the same benefit. Hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir with ribavirin were prescribed at similar frequency between groups. These agents have demonstrated mixed efficacy results for COVID-19 in placebo controlled-trials, with hydroxychloroquine being the most promising at this time. Immunomodulatory agents, such as tocilizumab, were infrequently used in this study.\nThis study has several limitations. Given the pandemic nature of the disease, a pragmatic quasi-experimental design was used, and there are some differences in the baseline characteristics of the comparator groups. The potential for regression to the mean and maturation is an inherent limitation to all quasi-experiments. On 16 March 2020, rapid on-site RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 testing was implemented, and some of the SOC group experienced delayed diagnosis and treatment. However, the observed association was unchanged in the sensitivity analysis. A nonequivalent dependent variable, empiric antibiotic therapy for pneumonia, suggested no difference in management of COVID-19. Some of the SOC group received corticosteroids after initiation of the updated COVID-19 institutional treatment protocol. Steroids initiated in this group were started significantly later. Additionally, guideline adherence in the early corticosteroid group was not universal, and may have been subject to channeling bias. Prone ventilation was attempted in a single SOC group patient and then not utilized again until late March. This may have impacted development of the primary outcome in the subset patients who required mechanical ventilation. Finally, the study has a limited follow-up period of 14 days and may be subject to lead-time bias, similar to other recent reports. As of 9 April 2020, 51 (62.9%) of patients in the SOC cohort and 88 (66.7%) of patients in the early corticosteroid cohort were discharged from the hospital. As a result, outcomes for those patients are not known. Anecdotally, we observed hyperglycemia but no severe corticosteroid related adverse effects (ie, gastrointestinal hemorrhage), and data collection is ongoing.\nIn conclusion, early use of a short course of methylprednisolone, an inexpensive and readily available agent, in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 may prevent progression of disease and improve outcomes. These findings are crucial given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and ICU bed and mechanical ventilator shortages. Research is urgently needed to further define the role of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 at a high risk of clinical deterioration, identified early in the disease course using prognostic markers or clinical prediction tools.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm

Therapy for Critically Ill Patients With Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: A Multicenter Observational Study","abstract":"Background\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of ribavirin and recombinant interferon (RBV/rIFN) therapy on the outcomes of critically ill patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), accounting for time-varying confounders.\n\n\nMethods\nThis is a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS from 14 hospitals in Saudi Arabia diagnosed between September 2012 and January 2018. We evaluated the association of RBV/rIFN with 90-day mortality and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA clearance using marginal structural modeling to account for baseline and time-varying confounders.\n\n\nResults\nOf 349 MERS patients, 144 (41.3%) patients received RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-?2a, rIFN-?2b, or rIFN-?1a; none received rIFN-?1b).\n\n RBV/rIFN was initiated at a median of 2 days (Q1, Q3: 1, 3 days) from intensive care unit admission.\n\n Crude 90-day mortality was higher in patients with RBV/rIFN compared to no RBV/rIFN (106/144 [73.6%] vs 126/205 [61.5%]; P = .\n\n02].\n\n After adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders using a marginal structural model, RBV/rIFN was not associated with changes in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .\n\n73–1.44]; P = .\n\n87) or with more rapid MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, .\n\n30–1.44]; P = .\n\n29).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this observational study, RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-?2a, rIFN-?2b, or rIFN-?1a) therapy was commonly used in critically ill MERS patients but was not associated with reduction in 90-day mortality or in faster MERS-CoV RNA clearance.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7108209","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Yaseen

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

Various agents were initially proclaimed to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are all examples of therapeutic agents, whose efficacy against COVID-19 was later disproved.\n Meanwhile, concentrated efforts of researchers and clinicians worldwide have led to the identification of novel therapeutic options to control the disease including PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332).\n Although COVID-19 cases are currently treated using a comprehensive approach of anticoagulants, oxygen, and antibiotics, the novel Pfizer agent PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332), an investigational COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate, significantly reduced hospitalization time and death rates, based on an interim analysis of the phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness.\n The scheduled interim analysis demonstrated an 89 % reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint).\n However, there still exists a great need for the development of additional treatments, as the recommended therapeutic options are insufficient in many cases.\n Thus far, mRNA and vector vaccines appear to be the most effective modalities to control the pandemic.\n In the current review, we provide an update on the progress that has been made since April 2020 in clinical trials concerning the effectiveness of therapies available to combat COVID-19.

(RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","abstract":"Background\nCasirivimab and imdevimab are non-competing monoclonal antibodies that bind to two different sites on the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, blocking viral entry into host cells.\n\n We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of casirivimab and imdevimab administered in combination in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nRECOVERY is a randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial comparing several possible treatments with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 127 UK hospitals took part in the evaluation of casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n Eligible participants were any patients aged at least 12 years admitted to hospital with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone or usual care plus casirivimab 4 g and imdevimab 4 g administered together in a single intravenous infusion.\n\n Investigators and data assessors were masked to analyses of the outcome data during the trial.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality assessed by intention to treat, first only in patients without detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection at randomisation (ie, those who were seronegative) and then in the overall population.\n\n Safety was assessed in all participants who received casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov (NCT04381936).\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Sept 18, 2020, and May 22, 2021, 9785 patients enrolled in RECOVERY were eligible for casirivimab and imdevimab, of which 4839 were randomly assigned to casirivimab and imdevimab plus usual care and 4946 to usual care alone.\n\n 3153 (32%) of 9785 patients were seronegative, 5272 (54%) were seropositive, and 1360 (14%) had unknown baseline antibody status.\n\n 812 (8%) patients were known to have received at least one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\n In the primary efficacy population of seronegative patients, 396 (24%) of 1633 patients allocated to casirivimab and imdevimab versus 452 (30%) of 1520 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 0·79, 95% CI 0·69–0·91; p=0·0009).\n\n In an analysis of all randomly assigned patients (regardless of baseline antibody status), 943 (19%) of 4839 patients allocated to casirivimab and imdevimab versus 1029 (21%) of 4946 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (RR 0·94, 95% CI 0·86–1·02; p=0·14).\n\n The proportional effect of casirivimab and imdevimab on mortality differed significantly between seropositive and seronegative patients (p value for heterogeneity=0·002).\n\n There were no deaths attributed to the treatment, or meaningful between-group differences in the pre-specified safety outcomes of cause-specific mortality, cardiac arrhythmia, thrombosis, or major bleeding events.\n\n Serious adverse reactions reported in seven (&lt;1%) participants were believed by the local investigator to be related to treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, the monoclonal antibody combination of casirivimab and imdevimab reduced 28-day mortality in patients who were seronegative (and therefore had not mounted their own humoral immune response) at baseline but not in those who were seropositive at baseline.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Research and Innovation

antibodies","abstract":"id='Par1'>The SARS-CoV-2 B.\n1.1.529 (Omicron) variant contains 15 mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD).\n How Omicron evades RBD-targeted neutralizing antibodies requires immediate investigation.\n Here we use high-throughput yeast display screening1,2 to determine the profiles of RBD escaping mutations for 247 human anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies and show that the neutralizing antibodies can be classified by unsupervised clustering into six epitope groups (A–F)—a grouping that is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications3–5.\n Various single mutations of Omicron can impair neutralizing antibodies of different epitope groups.\n Specifically, neutralizing antibodies in groups A–D, the epitopes of which overlap with the ACE2-binding motif, are largely escaped by K417N, G446S, E484A and Q493R.\n Antibodies in group E (for example, S309)6 and group F (for example, CR3022)7, which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but a subset of neutralizing antibodies are still escaped by G339D, N440K and S371L.\n Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could also be escaped, owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes.\n In total, over 85% of the tested neutralizing antibodies were escaped by Omicron.\n With regard to neutralizing-antibody-based drugs, the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10933, REGN10987, AZD1061, AZD8895 and BRII-196 was greatly undermined by Omicron, whereas VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still functioned at a reduced efficacy.\n Together, our data suggest that infection with Omicron would result in considerable humoral immune evasion, and that neutralizing antibodies targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region will remain most effective.\n Our results inform the development of antibody-based drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants.\n","id":"PMC8866119","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

to facilitate its infection.\n Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification.\n Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment.\n Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice.\n Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient.\n Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab.\n Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis.\n Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.","id":"PMC7714896","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

of a novel human CD147 knock-in NSG mouse model to test SARS-CoV-2 viral infection","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>An animal model that can mimic the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is critical to understanding the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and for development of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat emerging mutants.\n\n Studies show that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry.\n\n Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which are clearly invaluable.\n\n However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: (1) low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients; (2) low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients; and (3) hACE2Tg mice do not mimic the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.\n\n Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronavirus infection is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a possible co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry.\n\n It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par2'>Here we successfully generated a hCD147 knock-in mouse model (hCD147KI) in the NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG) background.\n\n In this hCD147KI-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed downstream of the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of hCD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 (JAX) model.\n\n In addition, the hCD147KI-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations in immunosuppressed states.\n\n Our data show (1) the human CD147 protein is expressed in various organs (including bronchiolar epithelial cells) in hCD147KI-NSG mice by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry; (2) hCD147KI-NSG mice are marginally sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to WT-NSG littermates characterized by increased viral copies by qRT-PCR and moderate body weight decline compared to baseline; (3) a significant increase in leukocytes in the lungs of hCD147KI-NSG mice, compared to infected WT-NSG mice.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par3'>hCD147KI-NSG mice are more sensitive to COVID-19 infection compared to WT-NSG mice.\n\n The hCD147KI-NSG mouse model can serve as an additional animal model for further interrogation whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at

humanized CD147 transgenic mice were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and its two variants, alpha and beta.\n When infected, these mice developed exudative alveolar pneumonia, featured by immune responses involving alveoli-infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes and activation of IL-17 signaling pathway.\n Mechanistically, we proposed that severe COVID-19-related cytokine storm is induced by a “spike protein-CD147-CyPA signaling axis”: Infection of SARS-CoV-2 through CD147 initiated the JAK-STAT pathway, which further induced expression of cyclophilin A (CyPA); CyPA reciprocally bound to CD147 and triggered MAPK pathway.\n Consequently, the MAPK pathway regulated the expression of cytokines and chemokines, which promoted the development of cytokine storm.\n Importantly, Meplazumab

symptomatic and for activating public health measures.\n Antigen rapid detection tests detect viral proteins and, although they are less sensitive than molecular tests, have the advantages of being easier to do, giving a faster time to result, of being lower cost, and able to detect infection in those who are most likely to be at risk of transmitting the virus to others.\n Antigen rapid detection tests can be used as a public health tool for screening individuals at enhanced risk of infection, to protect people who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure safe travel and the resumption of schooling and social activities, and to enable economic recovery.\n With vaccine roll-out, antibody tests (which detect the host's response to infection or vaccination) can be useful surveillance tools to inform public policy, but should not be used to provide proof of immunity, as the correlates of protection remain unclear.\n All three types of COVID-19 test continue to have a crucial role

17-year-old male with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) secondary to COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nCase report\nThis patient presented with cough, sore throat, anorexia and pyrexia.\n\n On examination, he had gross cervical lymphadenopathy and palpable splenomegaly.\n\n Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels.\n\n The patient's H-Score [2] was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 93–96%.\n\n Considering Russell and colleagues' [3] comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with COVID-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\n\nResults\nThe patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24?h.\n\n His lymph nodes and spleen began to normalise after the first 48?h, at which time point the ferritin also started to decrease.\n\n He was discharged after 11?days feeling fit and well.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis case certainly illustrates the importance of hyperinflammation syndromes in COVID-19. It also raises the question – is the severe pneumonitis seen in patients with COVID-19 an immunological phenomenon? We know that the viral load of patients with COVID-19 seems to peak in the early stages of illness [4,5]; however, patients deteriorate later in the disease course, at around days 10–14. This patient, who had risk factors for deterioration (male, pancytopaenic), did not develop an oxygen requirement and clinically and biochemically improved rapidly on Anakinra with no adverse events.\n\n We might suggest Anakinra to the scientific community as a treatment option in COVID-19 infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7245680","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Author(s).

ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs.\n\n 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs.\n\n 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.\n\n

in patients with COVID-19","abstract":"Background\nAn outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming a public health emergency.\n\n Data are limited on the duration and host factors related to viral shedding.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective study, risk factors associated with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a cohort of 113 symptomatic patients from two hospitals outside Wuhan.\n\n\nResults\nThe median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 days (Interquartile Range [IQR], 13–22 days) as measured from illness onset.\n\n When comparing patients with early (&lt;15 days) and late viral RNA clearance (?15 days after illness onset), prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (p=0.009), old age (p=0.033), concomitated with hypertension (p=0.009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (p=0.001), severe illness at admission (p=0.049), invasive mechanical ventilation (p=0.006), and corticosteroid treatment (p=0.025).\n\n Patients with longer SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration had slower recovery of body temperature (p&lt;0.001) and focal absorption on radiograph images (p&lt;0.001) than patients with early SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance.\n\n Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 3.24 [95% CI, 1.31–8.02]), delayed hospital admission (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.10–1.54]), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR, 9.88 [95% CI, 1.11–88.02]) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.\n\n\nConclusions\nMale sex, delayed admission to hospital after illness

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater

and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients","abstract":"Background:\nA patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta.\n\n The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear.\n\n This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively.\n\n The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients’ oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed.\n\n Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs.\n\n The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.\n\n\nResults:\nIn the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study.\n\n In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0–62.0) years were analyzed.\n\n After in-hospital treatment, patients’ inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition.\n\n The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0–11.0) days.\n\n By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients’ stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0–16.0) days after symptom onset.\n\n Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0–4.0) days.\n\n Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients’ urine specimens after throat swabs were negative.\n\n Using a multiple linear regression model (F?=?2.669, P?=?0.044, and adjusted R2?=?0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients’ stools (t?=??2.699, P?=?0.010).\n\n The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs.\n\n 8.0 days, respectively; t?=?2.550, P?=?0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs.\n\n 11 days, respectively; t?=?4.631, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P?&gt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions:\nIn brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients’ stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence.\n\n Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease.\n\n The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wolters

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

The epidemic spread rapidly to other regions outside of China and had a great impact on public health and the economy. To the best of our knowledge, no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 has been confirmed so far. A recent study demonstrated that cytokine storm syndrome is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Due to their anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties, corticosteroids have been widely used in China for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, especially in cases with secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Furthermore, China's National Health Commission has released a Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Pneumonitis with COVID-19 Infection. According to this, systemic corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, &lt;1-2 mg per kg of body weight, 3-5 days) is recommended as adjuvant therapy. The release of this guideline immediately caused controversy regarding whether patients with COVID-19 could benefit from corticosteroid therapy, since this has been associated with a delay in viral clearance. The present study investigated the effect of low-dose corticosteroid therapy on SARS-CoV-2 clearance time.\nDemographics and baseline characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 according to illness severity and corticosteroid use.\nTable 1	 	\nVariable	General group (n = 55)	Severe group (n = 23)	 	Corticosteroids (n = 9)	No Corticosteroids (n = 46)	P-value	Corticosteroids (n = 16)	No Corticosteroids (n = 7)	P-value	 	Age (years), mean +- SD	40.2 +- 12.6	39.9+-15.5	0.959	60.6+-13.6	54.3+-15.4	0.33	 	Male sex, n (%)	5 (55.6)	22 (47.8)	0.952	12 (75)	5 (71.4)	&gt;0.99	 	Days from onset of symptoms to hospitalization, median (Q1, Q3)	7 (4, 7.5)	5 (3, 7)	0.305	6.39+-3.9	8.3+-3.6	0.429	 	SOFA score, median (Q1, Q3)	/	/	/	2.0 (0, 2.8)	2.0 (1.0, 3.0)	0.702	 	ARDS, n (%)	0	0	/	8 (50)	1 (14.3)	0.176	 	Comorbidities							 	 Hypertension, n (%)	1 (11.1)	4 (8.7)	&gt;0.99	8 (50)	2 (28.6)	0.405	 	 Diabetes, n (%)	1 (11.1)	3 (6.5)	0.522	4 (25)	0	0.273	 	 Coronary heart disease, n (%)	0	1 (2.2)	&gt;0.99	2 (12.5)	0	&gt;0.99	 	 Cerebrovascular disease, n (%)	0	0	/	2 (12.5)	1 (14.3)	&gt;0.99	 	 Chronic kidney disease, n (%)	0	2 (4.3)	&gt;0.99	1 (6.3)	0	&gt;0.99	 	 Chronic liver disease, n (%)	2 (22.2)	1 (2.2)	0.066	0	0	/	 	 Malignant tumor, n (%)	0	1 (2.2)	&gt;0.99	0	0	/	 	 Immunosuppressive, n (%)	0	1 (2.2)	&gt;0.99	0	0	/	 	WBC count (x109/L), median (Q1, Q3)	4.6 (4.0, 5.5)	4.9 (3.9, 6.0)		6.5 (5.5, 10.6)	5.4 (4.8, 11.9)	0.789	 	Lymphocyte count (x109/L), median (Q1, Q3)	0.89 (0.84, 1.38)	1.33 (1.16, 1.79)	0.062	0.62 (0.37, 0.98)	1.14 (0.73, 1.36)	0.082	 	CRP (mg /L), median (Q1, Q3)	22.1 (8.9, 36.4)	4.2 (0.7, 16.6)	0.091	47.8 (30.0, 102.3)	23.5 (8.5, 72.0)	0.124	 	PCT &lt;0.5 ng/mL, n (%)	9 (100)	46 (100)	/	15 (93.8)	7 (100)	&gt;0.99	 	PT (s), median (Q1, Q3)	14 (13.6, 15.3)	14.4 (13.4, 16.2)	0.793	14.3 (13.0, 15.0)	14.1 (13.7, 14.6)	0.894	 	APTT (s), median (Q1, Q3)	38.7 (35.3, 42.0)	37.1 (34.6, 42.9)	0.649	35 (30.2, 39.5)	36.7 (27.4, 38.8)	0.462	 	D-Dimer (microg/ml), median (Q1, Q3)	0.25 (0.2, 0.29)	0.18 (0.08, 0.25)	0.09	0.45 (0.25, 0.62)	0.22 (0.19, 0.63)	0.452	 	Troponin I (microg/L), median (Q1, Q3)	0.08 (0.07, 0.11)	0.08 (0.06, 0.19)	0.90	0.31 (0.09, 0.56)	0.12 (0.1, 0.44)	0.72	 	Total bilirubin (micromol/L), median (Q1, Q3)	14.5 (12.6, 23.3)	14.9 (11.3, 19.3)	0.838	17.1 (15.3, 21.4)	17.1 (11.1, 19.4)	0.452	 	Albumin (g/L), median (Q1, Q3)	44.2 (41.0, 45.0)	44.9 (41.3, 47.7)	0.847	35.2 (32.9, 37.4)	39.3 (36.8, 42.2)	0.022	 	Creatinine (micromol/L), median (Q1, Q3)	66 (58, 71)	71 (60, 81)	0.052	74.0 (54.0, 82.0)	68 (59, 76)	0.82	 	Antiviral therapy							 	 Lopinavir/Ritonavir only, n (%)	7 (77.8)	37 (80.4)	0.785	4 (25.0)	3 (42.9)	0.626	 	 Lopinavir/Ritonavir+IFN-alpha inhalation, n (%)	2 (22.2)	9 (19.6)		12 (75.0)	4 (57.1)		 	 TCM, n (%)	3 (33.3)	19 (41.3)	0.941	16 (100)	6 (85.7)	0.304	 	Methylprednisolone							 	 Oral, n (%)	9 (100)	/	/	0	/	/	 	 Intravenous, n (%)	0	/	/	16 (100)	/	/	 	Duration of corticosteroid treatment (days), median (Q1, Q3)	7 (5.5, 8.0)	/	/	4.5 (3.0, 5.8)	/	/	 	Total dose of methylprednisolone (mg), median (Q1, Q3)	280 (220, 360)	/	/	160 (120, 240)	/	/	 	Dose of methylprednisolone per day (mg), median (Q1, Q3)	38 (33, 48)	/	/	40 (40, 40)	/	/	 	Time to SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance (days), mean +- SD	17.6+-4.9	18.7+-7.7	0.667	18.8+-5.3	18.3+-4.2	0.84	 	\nWBC white blood cell, CRP C-reaction protein, PCT Procalcitonin, TCM Traditional Chinese Medicine, PT prothrombin time, APTT Activated partial thromboplastin time\nThe present study collected clinical data of 78 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the Infectious Diseases Branch of Anhui Provincial Hospital between January 22, 2020 and March 1, 2020. A total of 55 and 23 cases were diagnosed with general and severe COVID-19, respectively. All patients received standard treatment, including antiviral therapy, oxygen therapy, antibacterial drugs and symptomatic therapies. Furthermore, patients in the severe group received the necessary supportive treatment. Corticosteroids were administrated to a subset of patients according to severity and the individual opinion of clinicians. More severe patients were treated with corticosteroids, leading to inconsistent baseline data (i.e., age, comorbidities and laboratory findings) between patients receiving corticosteroids and those who did not. Therefore, the 78 patients were divided into a general and a severe group, and separate data analysis was conducted for each group. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory test results and antiviral treatment of patients with or without corticosteroid treatment in the general and severe groups. In total, there were 25 patients who received corticosteroids, while the remaining patients did not receive corticosteroids (Table 1). Oral methylprednisolone [median hydrocortisone-equivalent dose, 237.5 mg/day (IQR, 206.3-300.0 mg/day)] was administered to 9 patients in the general group for a median duration of 7 days (IQR, 5.5-8.0 days), while intravenous methylprednisolone [median hydrocortisone-equivalent dose, 250.0 mg/day (IQR, 250.0-250.0 mg/day)] was administered to 16 patients in the severe group for a median duration of 4.5 days (IQR, 3.5-5.8 days). The 9 patients in the general group received a higher total dose of corticosteroids and had a longer duration of corticosteroids treatment, since all of them were hospitalized at the early stage of the epidemic and treated by the same medical team. Starting at 3 days after admission, ~2-3 throat swabs or sputum samples were routinely collected once per week from all patients for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to assess viral clearance. If the RT-PCR test result was negative, the test was repeated the next day to avoid false-negative results. Briefly, an independent sample t-test was conducted to compare virus clearance time between the corticosteroid group and the non-corticosteroid group, and there was no significant difference identified in both patients in the general group (17.6 +- 4.9 vs. 18.7 +- 7.7 days; P = 0.667) and patients in the severe group (18.8 +- 5.3 vs. 18.3 +- 4.2 days; P = 0.84).\nThere has been controversy regarding whether corticosteroid use may delay viral clearance in patients with viral pneumonia for a long time. Initially, this phenomenon was observed in studies investigating severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS).   However, the dose of corticosteroids may have a significant impact on the results. An observational study by Cao on influenza A (H7N9) viral pneumonia has demonstrated that high doses of corticosteroids (&gt;150 mg/d methylprednisolone) are associated with increased risks of mortality and delayed viral clearance, while there was no difference between patients in the low-dose group (25-150 mg/d methylprednisolone) and controls. In the present study, all 25 patients were treated with low-dose corticosteroids, and the conclusions were similar to those of Cao.\nIn another retrospective observational study reporting on patients with MERS who were critically-ill, nearly half of the enrolled patients received low-dose corticosteroids [median hydrocortisone-equivalent dose, 300.0 mg/day (IQR, 200.0-400.0 mg/day)]. When compared with the cases who were not treated with corticosteroids, the authors concluded that the administration of corticosteroids was associated with delayed viral clearance. Unlike in the study reporting on MERS, the patients enrolled in the present study exhibited an improved health status. Even in patients in the severe group, the SOFA score on the first day of admission was much lower than that of patients with MERS [2.0 (IQR, 0-2.8) vs. 9.0 (IQR, 6.0-12.0)]. Therefore, these two studies involved patients with different severities of illness; however, whether corticosteroids exerted greater effects in critically-ill patients requires further investigation. Furthermore, the study reporting on patients with MERS included RT-PCR data from 14 intensive care units, and the nucleic acid test results were not protocolized and varied among centers. In the present study, all patients were from a single center, and all swab samples were tested using a unified approach at the Chinese Center for Disease Control to avoid measurement bias.\nIn fact, a similar study analyzing data from 72 patients with COVID-19 was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, and the conclusions were consistent with the results of the present study. However, these two retrospective studies have unavoidable limitations, such as small sample size, poor controllability of the data and bias in the process of data collection. In conclusion, low-dose corticosteroid therapy may not delay viral clearance in patients with COVID-19; however, this still needs to be confirmed by well-designed and large-scale RCTs with a longer follow-up duration.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nReferences\nClinical progression of patients with COVID-19 in Shanghai, China\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nNational Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.

city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

The epidemic spread rapidly to other regions outside of China and had a great impact on public health and the economy. To the best of our knowledge, no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 has been confirmed so far. A recent study demonstrated that cytokine storm syndrome is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Due to their anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties, corticosteroids have been widely used in China for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, especially in cases with secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Furthermore, China's National Health Commission has released a Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Pneumonitis with COVID-19 Infection. According to this, systemic corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, &lt;1-2 mg per kg of body weight, 3-5 days) is recommended as adjuvant therapy. The release of this guideline immediately caused controversy regarding whether patients with COVID-19 could benefit from corticosteroid therapy, since this has been associated with a delay in viral clearance.

A total of 55 and 23 cases were diagnosed with general and severe COVID-19, respectively. All patients received standard treatment, including antiviral therapy, oxygen therapy, antibacterial drugs and symptomatic therapies. Furthermore, patients in the severe group received the necessary supportive treatment. Corticosteroids were administrated to a subset of patients according to severity and the individual opinion of clinicians. More severe patients were treated with corticosteroids, leading to inconsistent baseline data (i.e., age, comorbidities and laboratory findings) between patients receiving corticosteroids and those who did not. Therefore, the 78 patients were divided into a general and a severe group, and separate data analysis was conducted for each group. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory test results and antiviral treatment of patients with or without corticosteroid treatment in the general and severe groups. In total, there were 25 patients who received corticosteroids, while the remaining patients did not receive corticosteroids (Table 1). Oral methylprednisolone [median hydrocortisone-equivalent dose, 237.5 mg/day (IQR, 206.3-300.0 mg/day)] was administered to 9 patients in the general group for a median duration of 7 days (IQR, 5.5-8.0 days), while intravenous methylprednisolone [median hydrocortisone-equivalent dose, 250.0 mg/day (IQR, 250.0-250.0 mg/day)] was administered to 16 patients in the severe group for a median duration of 4.5 days (IQR, 3.5-5.8 days). The 9 patients in the general group received a higher total dose of corticosteroids and had a longer duration of corticosteroids treatment, since all of them were hospitalized at the early stage of the epidemic and treated by the same medical team. Starting at 3 days after admission, ~2-3 throat swabs or sputum samples were routinely collected once per week from all patients for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to assess viral clearance. If the RT-PCR test result was negative, the test was repeated the next day to avoid false-negative results. Briefly, an independent sample t-test was conducted to compare virus clearance time between the corticosteroid group and the non-corticosteroid group, and there was no significant difference identified in both patients in the general group (17.6 +- 4.9 vs. 18.7 +- 7.7 days; P = 0.667) and patients in the severe group (18.8 +- 5.3 vs. 18.3 +- 4.2 days; P = 0.84).\nThere has been controversy regarding whether corticosteroid use may delay viral clearance in patients with viral pneumonia for a long time. Initially, this phenomenon was observed in studies investigating severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS).   However, the dose of corticosteroids may have a significant impact on the results. An observational study by Cao on influenza A (H7N9) viral pneumonia has demonstrated that high doses of corticosteroids (&gt;150 mg/d methylprednisolone) are associated with increased risks of mortality and delayed viral clearance, while there was no difference between patients in the low-dose group (25-150 mg/d methylprednisolone) and controls. In the present study, all 25 patients were treated with low-dose corticosteroids, and the conclusions were similar to those of Cao.\nIn another retrospective observational study reporting on patients with MERS who were critically-ill, nearly half of the enrolled patients received low-dose corticosteroids [median hydrocortisone-equivalent dose, 300.0 mg/day (IQR, 200.0-400.0 mg/day)]. When compared with the cases who were not treated with corticosteroids, the authors concluded that the administration of corticosteroids was associated with delayed viral clearance. Unlike in the study reporting on MERS, the patients enrolled in the present study exhibited an improved health status. Even in patients in the severe group, the SOFA score on the first day of admission was much lower than that of patients with MERS [2.0 (IQR, 0-2.8) vs. 9.0 (IQR, 6.0-12.0)]. Therefore, these two studies involved patients with different severities of illness; however, whether corticosteroids exerted greater effects in critically-ill patients requires further investigation. Furthermore, the study reporting on patients with MERS included RT-PCR data from 14 intensive care units, and the nucleic acid test results were not protocolized and varied among centers. In the present study, all patients were from a single center, and all swab samples were tested using a unified approach at the Chinese Center for Disease Control to avoid measurement bias.\nIn fact, a similar study analyzing data from 72 patients with COVID-19 was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, and the conclusions were consistent with the results of the present study. However, these two retrospective studies have unavoidable limitations, such as small sample size, poor controllability of the data and bias in the process of data collection. In conclusion, low-dose corticosteroid therapy may not delay viral clearance in patients with COVID-19; however, this still needs to be confirmed by well-designed and large-scale RCTs with a longer follow-up duration.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nReferences\nClinical progression of patients with COVID-19 in Shanghai, China\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nNational Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.

city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P &lt; 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P &gt; 0.05).\nConclusions:\nIn brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.\nIntroduction\nIn January 2020, a new coronavirus was confirmed as the cause of unexplained pneumonia in a group of patients from Wuhan, Hubei, and was subsequently named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Due to increasing numbers of cases reported out of China, the World Health Organization announced on January 30 that the emerging new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic constituted a public health emergency of international concern. Up until February 11, 2020, there were 44,653 confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases reported in China and 395 cases in 24 other countries. The transmission capacity of 2019-nCoV was underestimated at first. Initial studies showed its regeneration number, R0, was 2.2 to 2.9, meaning that each infector could transmit to another 2.2 to 2.9 people. Recently a novel study revealed that the R0 of 2019-nCoV is 3.77 based on clinical and epidemiological data from nearly 8866 patients in 30 provinces, which is higher than the R0 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (R0, 2-3).\nThe patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta. All patients with positive viral RNA detection need to be isolated. As mentioned in the &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme of New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia&quot; (trial version 5), only after the relief of symptoms and two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative viral nucleic acid results for respiratory specimens, the isolated cases can be disisolation. However, the persistence and clearance of viral RNA in different specimens of COVID-19 patients remains unclear. In this study, viral RNA detection was performed on throat swabs, and stool, urine, and serum specimens, which were analyzed based on different clinical conditions and lab results, to figure out the clearance time of the virus and factors which may influence this.\nMethods\nEthical approval\nThis retrospective study was approved by the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center Ethics Committee (No. YJ-2020-S015-01) and was exempted from the need for informed consent from patients.\nSubjects\nFrom January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020, all confirmed patients with COVID-19 in the Shanghai region were admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. The convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs.\nClinical measures\nClinical data and lab results were recorded at admission and last fecal viral RNA test, including sex, age, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocyte counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT). The glucocorticoid treatment group included any patients who were ever treated with glucocorticoids, such as prednisolone or dexamethasone. The feces-positive and feces-negative groups were classified based on the detection of viral RNA in patients' feces. The clinical conditions and lab results of study subjects, together with the viral RNA results from different specimens (oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum) from each day were collected retrospectively.\nDetection of viral RNA in COVID-19\nA magnetic bead-method nucleic acid extraction kit was applied in a fully automated nucleic acid extraction instrument (Master Biotechnology, China). The total RNA was extracted from a 200-muL sample and dual fluorescence PCR (Applied Biosystems 251658240 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems, Foster City, CA, USA) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 (International Business Machines Corporation, IBM, Armonk, New York, USA). Normally distributed continuous variables are summarized as the mean and standard deviation, and non-normally distributed data are recorded as median and interquartile range (IQR) as appropriate. Categorical variables are expressed as counts and percentages for each category. The t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were applied to test differences between two groups; Fisher exact tests or Chi-square tests were used for categorical variables. Multiple linear regression was applied to determine the relationship between outcomes and the exploratory factor. P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.\nResults\nDemographics and laboratory examination results\nFrom January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020, 292 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. Sixty-six convalescent patients were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. The oldest patient was 78 years old and the youngest was 16 years old. There was no difference in sex or age between those with or without glucocorticoid treatment (chi2 = 0.342, P = 0.599; t = 1.059, P = 0.294). On admission, the average high level of ESR was 70.0 (25.5-90.0) mm/h, high-sensitivity CRP was 8.4 (1.6-20.3) mg/L, and PCT was 0.03 (0.02-0.05) ng/mL, which decreased to 44.0 (29.5-81.3) mm/h, 0.5 (0.5-2.1) mg/L, and 0.02 (0.02-0.02) ng/mL, respectively, upon treatment [Table 1].\nClearance time of viral RNA with or without glucocorticoid treatment.\nVirus RNA detection in different samples from patients with COVID-19\nThe median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs of convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days with improvement in symptoms such as fever, cough, and dyspnea. This time varied greatly between patients, ranging from 2 to 22 days. The RT-PCR for viral RNA was performed using stool, urine, and blood specimens during convalescence. Until the end of the observation period (February 10, 2020), 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA in stool specimens. The other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days. Twelve patient (21.8% 12/55) Viral RNA in oropharyngeal swabs or fecal samples from was negative at the same time; 78.2% (43/55) of cases had longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Viral nucleic acid was found in urine in only four (6.9%) patients out of 58 cases [Table 1]; viral RNA was present in urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Fourteen serum specimens were tested for 2019-nCoV and none of them showed positive results (Data not shown).\nFactors related to virus clearance\nAn analysis of the correlation between the absolute values of CD4+ T lymphocytes, CRP, red blood cell sedimentation rate, PCT, and the time of detoxification for feces during convalescence was performed. Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.699, P = 0.044, and adjusted R2 = 0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patient stool samples (t = -2.699, P = 0.010) [Table 2].\nMultiple linear regression analysis of immune and inflammatory parameters with respect to virus clearance.\nDuring hospitalization, five patients received glucocorticoid treatment. The duration of viral RNA detection in throat swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, t = 2.550, P = 0.013; 20 days vs. 11 days t = 4.631, P &lt; 0.001, respectively). We further analyzed the differences in the results of the last tests for inflammatory indicators upon positive results for viral RNA in fecal samples. There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive and negative fecal viral RNA test results (P &gt; 0.05) [Table 3].\nViral RNA analysis of stool samples with the inflammatory indicators of patients.\nDiscussion\nThe novel coronavirus was firstly identified in respiratory specimens from patients with COVID-19 and viral nucleic acids were subsequently detected in patients' stool, urine, and gastrointestinal mucosa. Recently a neonatal infection was reported, indicating the possibility of fecal-oral and vertical transmission from mother to child, in addition to the currently confirmed droplet transmission and direct contact transmission. In this study, we found that the viral RNA can be detected in the stool of 81.8% (54/66) patients, even in those with negative results from throat swabs. The continuous detection of viral nucleic acids in feces suggests that the virus may be transmitted through the digestive tract or re-transmitted through aerosols containing viruses. Therefore, it is necessary urgently to standardize the stool transport process of COVID-19 patients to reduce risk of further transmission. Moreover, viral RNA detection in fecal samples should be applied regularly in patients with COVID-19, even during the recovery period. Transmission by urine or blood may occur less frequently because of the low rate of positive findings in patients.\nGlucocorticoids have been widely used in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and are now also used in conjunction with other drugs to treat patients infected with 2019-nCoV. However, in the published clinical management opinions for the COVID-19, the application of glucocorticoids is not recommended unless there are other indications. The use of glucocorticoids may delay the clearance of viral nucleic acids in patients and should be avoided during viral replication. Some bias exists in our study because the patients in the glucocorticoid treatment group had more severe disease and lower CD4+ T lymphocytes counts. Our point is that mild patients are not recommended glucocorticoid treatment, which may delay virus clearance. The randomized controlled double-blind experiments with expanded sample sizes will help clarify this issue. T cell immunity may play an important role in 2019-nCoV infection. The absolute values of CD4+ T lymphocytes, CRP, ESR, and PCT measured upon admission were analyzed with respect to virus clearance. The lower the absolute value of CD4+ T lymphocytes before treatment, the longer duration of virus clearance. The relationship between the fecal viral RNA results and inflammatory indicators of patients were analyzed and no statistical difference in ESR, CRP, or PCT during rehabilitation was found.\nIn brief, as the clearance of viral RNA from patients' stools was delayed compared to that from oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to detect the viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may be related to host cell immunity.\nFunding\nThe work was supported by grants from the First-class university and first-class discipline building project of the Fudan University (No. IDF162005) and the Scientific research for special subjects on 2019 novel coronavirus (No. 2019-nCoV) of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (No. 2020YJKY01).\nConflicts of interest\nNone.\nHow to cite this article: Ling Y, Xu SB, Lin YX, Tian D, Zhu ZQ, Dai FH, Wu F, Song ZG, Huang W, Chen J, Hu BJ, Wang S, Mao EQ, Zhu L, Zhang WH, Lu HZ.

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"30 January 2020 pneumonia epidemic situation of C SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hubei province, China-Hubei Provincial Health Committee","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"4 February 2020 pneumonia epidemic situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hubei province, China-Hubei Provincial Health Committee","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.

Adjuvant corticosteroid therapy of such patients is common in clinical practice, but evidence is scarce regarding the efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids in patients who are critically ill with COVID-19.\nWe retrospectively reviewed medical records of adult patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) from January 25 to February 25, 2020. Two hundred forty-four eligible patients who had complete records and were critically ill and treated with antiviral agents were enrolled. Critically ill patients were defined as those with ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 &lt;= 300 mmHg; when PaO2 is not available, SpO2/FiO2 &lt;= 315 suggests ARDS) or sepsis with acute organ dysfunction. We converted all preparations to hydrocortisone-equivalent doses (methylprednisolone 1:5, dexamethasone 1:25). The clinical outcome was 28-day mortality after admission.\nWe adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics by propensity score, using multivariate logistic regression without regard to outcomes. Potential confounders considered in propensity score matching (PSM) were variables included in the final model by step-wise backward elimination with P &lt; 0.20. Corticosteroid treatment effect on outcome was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for major variables (age, SpO2/FiO2, and lymphocytes) associated with mortality; individual propensity score was incorporated as a covariable to calculate the propensity-adjusted odds ratio (OR). PSM generated propensity score-matched pairs without replacement, and survival probability was compared by the Kaplan-Meier curve and analyzed with the log-rank test. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI. For unadjusted comparisons, a two-sided P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nBaseline characteristics for steroid treatment and non-steroid treatment groups comprising critically ill patients with COVID-19 before and after propensity score matching\n	Cohort study	Case-control study (PSM)	 		Steroid (151)	Non-steroid (93)	P	Steroid (31)	Non-steroid (31)	P	 	Age, years	64 (53-71)	59 (47-69)	.09	57 (51-69)	58 (50-67)	.98	 	Gender, male	83 (55)	45 (48)	.39	16 (52)	16 (52)	1	 	Signs and symptoms	 	 Fever	136 (90)	81 (87)	.61	30 (97)	26 (84)	.2	 	 Dry cough	112 (74)	57 (61)	.05	21 (68)	21 (68)	1	 	 Dyspnea	94 (62)	53 (57)	.5	20 (65)	19 (61)	1	 	 Fatigue	70 (46)	48 (52)	.51	12 (39)	13 (42)	1	 	 Expectoration	69 (46)	30 (32)	.05	12 (39)	12 (39)	1	 	 Diarrhea	45 (30)	22 (24)	.37	10 (32)	7 (23)	.57	 	 Anorexia	42 (28)	25 (27)	.99	5 (16)	8 (26)	.53	 	Original comorbidities	 	 Hypertension	61 (40)	34 (37)	.64	16 (52)	12 (39)	.44	 	 Diabetes	34 (23)	10 (11)	.03	4 (13)	7 (23)	.51	 	 CVD	15 (10)	13 (14)	.45	2 (7)	2 (7)	1	 	 COPD	9 (6)	3 (3)	.51	0	1 (3)	1	 	Vital signs	 	 T,  C	37.0 (36.2-38)	36.7 (36.4-37.3)	.02	37 (36.5-37.6)	37 (36.5-37.3)	.93	 	 Breathing, rpm	22 (20-25)	20 (20-22)	&lt; .01	21 (20-24)	20 (20-22)	.08	 	 Pulse, bpm	92 (82-105)	88 (78-98)	.03	95 (78-106)	93 (82-100)	.51	 	 SpO2/FiO2	259 (121-303)	297 (279-388)	&lt; .01	291 (212-452)	294 (246-396)	.57	 	Laboratory findings (WBCs, lymphocytes, neutrophils, platelets, x 109/L)	 	 WBCs	6.7 (4.9-8.9)	5.0 (4.0-6.5)	&lt; .01	6.6 (4.0-8.6)	5.1 (3.5-6.8)	.12	 	 Lymphocytes	0.7 (0.5-1.0)	1.2 (0.9-1.6)	&lt; .01	0.9 (0.5-1.3)	1.1 (0.6-1.2)	.64	 	 Neutrophils	5.4 (3.6-7.6)	3.2 (2.4-4.2)	&lt; .01	5.2 (2.6-7.4)	3.5 (2.3-4.7)	.09	 	 Platelets	181 (138-248)	224 (170-298)	&lt; .01	168 (138-214)	206 (155-230)	.23	 	 HGB, g/L	130 (117-141)	127 (117-139)	.42	128 (118-138)	125 (117-133)	.56	 	Organ function damage	 	 ARDS	81 (54)	6 (7)	&lt; .01	12 (39)	6 (19)	.16	 	 Septic shock	69 (46)	2 (2)	&lt; .01	8 (26)	2 (7)	.08	 	 Myocardial infarction	64 (42)	3 (3)	&lt; .01	10 (32)	3 (10)	.06	 	 AKI	46 (31)	5 (5)	&lt; .01	8 (26)	3 (10)	.18	 	 DIC	39 (26)	2 (2)	&lt; .01	6 (19)	2 (7)	.26	 	 Liver injury	28 (19)	6 (7)	&lt; .01	7 (23)	3 (10)	.3	 	Treatment	 	 Anti-bacteria	142 (94)	42 (45)	&lt; .01	25 (81)	26 (84)	1	 	 Gamma globulin	84 (56)	8 (9)	&lt; .01	11 (36)	8 (26)	.58	 	 MV	78 (52)	4 (4)	&lt; .01	11 (36)	4 (13)	.08	 	 Muscle relaxant	25 (17)	0	&lt; .01	4 (13)	0	.12	 	 HFNC	21 (14)	1 (1)	&lt; .01	6 (19)	1 (3)	.11	 	\nAbbreviations: CVD cardiovascular disease, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, WBCs white blood cells, ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, AKI acute kidney injury, DIC disseminated intravascular coagulation, MV mechanical ventilation, HFNC high flow nasal cannula\nContinuous variables were described as the median (IQR) while categorical variables were expressed as frequencies (%). Hypothesis testing using Fisher's exact test for categorical data and Mann-Whitney test for continuous data\nSurvival curves stratified by adjuvant corticosteroid treatment. Thirty-one critically ill patients with COVID-19 who received corticosteroid treatment (yellow line) are compared with 31 matched control subjects (green line) who did not receive corticosteroid treatment\nOf the 244 critically ill patients with COVID-19, the median age was 62 (50-71) years, and 52% were male. All patients were given antiviral therapy (e.g., oseltamivir, arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, ganciclovir, interferon-alpha), and 151 (62%) were given adjuvant corticosteroid treatment (median hydrocortisone-equivalent dosage 200 [range 100-800] mg/day). Five (5.4%) and 79 (52.3%) patients died in non-steroid and steroid groups, respectively. The median (IQR) administration duration of corticosteroid treatment was 8 (4-12) days. Multiple organ dysfunctions were more common in the steroid group than in the non-steroid group. Multivariate analysis that adjusted for major mortality-associated variables and propensity score indicated that corticosteroid treatment was independent from overall mortality (adjusted OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.15-7.46). One hundred forty-seven (60%) had dyspnea and 87 (36%) had ARDS, and subgroup analyses revealed corticosteroid treatment was not associated with 28-day mortality (both, P &gt; 0.3). Sixty-two patients in 31 pairs were matched (Table 1), and 28-day mortality rate was 39% in case subjects and 16% in control subjects (P = 0.09). Likewise, addition of adjuvant corticosteroid therapy to standard antiviral treatment was not associated with 28-day mortality (P = 0.17; Fig. 1). However, increased corticosteroid dosage was significantly associated with elevated mortality risk after adjustment for administration duration (P = 0.003); every 10-mg increase in dosage was associated with additional 4% mortality risk (adjusted HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07). \nWe acknowledged limitations. First, we did not distinguish patients who received corticosteroids for underlying disease (e.g., COPD), the number of which was however small. Second, PSM is limited by adjusting for observed covariables only; randomized placebo-controlled trials are therefore warranted. Altogether, our investigation indicated limited effect of corticosteroid therapy could pose to overall survival of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Given the adverse effects, corticosteroid therapy must be commenced with caution, and prudent dosage should be promoted under certain circumstances.\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nXiaofan Lu, Taige Chen, Yang Wang and Jun Wang contributed equally to this work.\nAuthors' contributions\nConceptualization: X.
