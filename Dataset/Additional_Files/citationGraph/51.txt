In conclusion, this frontline report suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection has a severe course in SOT recipients.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn December 2019, a cluster of patients with acute respiratory illness of unknown origin was reported from the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The causative agent of the now termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), which belongs to a unique clade of the sarbecovirus subgenus within the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. Following the rapid worldwide spread, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The current COVID-19 pandemic is creating unprecedented challenges to health care systems across the world and particularly in areas with large community transmission such as the region of Madrid (Spain), with 17 166 cases diagnosed by March 26. \nThe clinical features, optimal therapeutic approach, and outcomes of COVID-19 among solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients remain largely unknown. First clinical descriptions from China and Singapore did not contain data on the specific SOT population.   The first case of posttransplant COVID-19 was reported in a 52-year-old Chinese kidney transplant (KT) recipient, with favorable response following discontinuation of maintenance immunosuppression and low-dose methylprednisolone, nebulized interferon (IFN)-alpha, and polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. A second report from Spain did not contain information on final patient outcome at day +12 after diagnosis. By analogy to other viral respiratory tract infections, namely the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic,   the risk of pneumonia and progression to septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome is expected to be increased among SOT recipients with COVID-19 compared with the nontransplant population. On the other hand, it could be hypothesized that long-term posttransplant immunosuppression would abrogate to some extent the hyperinflammatory syndrome secondary to the cytokine storm that leads to multiorgan failure and is ultimately responsible for most of SARS-CoV-2-attributable deaths. \nDue to the urgent need of clinical experience to guide the management of this new disease in such rapidly evolving scenario, a multicenter cohort study involving many transplant centers across Spain is ongoing. We report herein our preliminary experience with the first 18 SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 by March 23 at a tertiary-care institution at Madrid with a large multiorgan transplant program.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy population and design\nAdult (&gt;=18 years) SOT recipients routinely followed at the University Hospital &quot;12 de Octubre&quot; (Madrid, Spain) and diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 5 to March 23, 2020, were included. The local Clinical Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (ref. no. 20/151) and granted a waiver of informed consent due to its retrospective observational design.\nPatients were enrolled at the time of diagnosis of COVID-19 and followed to April 4, 2020. Clinical characteristics, radiological features, laboratory values, antiviral drugs administered, management of baseline immunosuppression, and patient and graft outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardized case report form. All laboratory and imaging investigations were performed as part of standard of care. Respiratory function was assessed by means of the pulse oximetry saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratio, which has a good correlation with the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2)/FiO2 ratio (SpO2/FiO2 = 64 + 0.84 x PaO2/FiO2). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was therefore classified as mild, moderate, and severe according to SpO2/FiO2 ratio thresholds of 316, 232, and 148, respectively. Unfavorable outcome was defined by the presence of progressive respiratory failure (i.e., sustained worsening of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio and/or development of ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or death.\nPatient management\nAll SOT recipients presenting at the emergency room or outpatient clinic with suggestive symptoms and signs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made by means of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples according to established methods. Such procedures were performed in a dedicated area for immunocompromised patients at the emergency department (ED). All SOT recipients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were placed on droplets and contact precautions, and no visits were allowed in patient rooms. Attending staff wore personal protective equipment according to institutional protocols.\nAntiviral and immunomodulatory therapy\nIn line with clinical practice guidelines proposed by the Spanish Ministry of Health and local protocols, coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (200/100 mg twice daily orally for up to 14 days) and/or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (400 mg twice daily orally for the first 24 hours, followed by 200 mg twice daily for 5-10 days) were prescribed to patients with pneumonia after written or oral informed consent. Subcutaneous (SC) IFN-beta (250 mug every 48 hours) could be added according to the criteria of the treating physician, on the basis of the severity of COVID-19 illness and the perceived risk of rejection. Patients with symptoms restricted to the upper respiratory tract, normal oxygen saturation and no radiologic features of pneumonia could be treated with outpatient HCQ monotherapy. Tocilizumab (single 600 mg intravenous dose) was added in selected cases with progressive respiratory failure and increasing inflammatory parameters. The adjuvant use of low- to medium-dose corticosteroids was not explicitly encouraged. Empirical antibiotic therapy was associated if bacterial superinfection was suspected.\nAdjustment of immunosuppressive regimen\nThe management of immunosuppression was left to the discretion of the attending transplant physician, although tapering of maintenance therapy was usually attempted. Calcineurin and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors were temporarily discontinued on initiation of LPV/r and trough serum levels were obtained after 48-72 hours, with close therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) thereafter. Baseline daily prednisone dose was usually reduced by 50%. Mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid (MMF/MPA) was also decreased in patients receiving LPV/r The QT interval was regularly assessed in patients treated with HCQ.\nStatistical analysis\nQuantitative data are shown as the mean +- SD or the median with IQR. Qualitative variables were expressed as absolute and relative frequencies. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 20.0 (IBM Corp.).\nRESULTS\nDemographics, clinical characteristics, and symptoms at presentation in 18 SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19\nTABLE 1	 	\nCase	Gender/age (y)	Type of SOT/time interval (y)a	Cause of transplantation and major comorbidities	Maintenance immunosuppression regimen	Previous ACEi/ARB therapy	Symptoms at presentation	Duration of symptoms (d)b	 	#1	M/78	Kidney/8.3	PKD, hypertension, prostatic adenocarcinoma	Prednisone, tacrolimus	No	Fever, shortness of breath	1	 	#2	M/73	Kidney/1.8	Hypertensive nephropathy, hypertension, diabetes	Prednisone, tacrolimus, MPA	Enalapril	Fever, shortness of breath, cough	4	 	#3	M/80	Kidney/3.8	Hypertensive nephropathy, hypertension, diabetes, peripheral artery disease	Prednisone, tacrolimus, MPA	No	Shortness of breath, cough, myalgia, hypoxia	7	 	#4	F/71	Kidney/6.0	ESRD of unknown cause, hypertension	Prednisone, tacrolimus, MPA	No	Fever, shortness of breath, cough, sore throat	7	 	#5	M/71	Kidney/30.1	PKD, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease	Tacrolimus	No	Fever, epigastric pain	1	 	#6	M/76	Kidney/14.8	IgA nephropathy, hypertension, obesity	Prednisone, MMF, rapamycin	Losartan	Fever, rhinorrhea	3	 	#7	M/39	Kidney/16.8	PKD, hypertension	Prednisone, tacrolimus, EVE	Enalapril	Fever, myalgia	1	 	#8	M/65	Kidney/6.5	Chronic interstitial nephritis, hypertension, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome	Prednisone, tacrolimus, MPA	No	Fever, shortness of breath, cough, myalgia	5	 	#9	M/63	Liver/7.9	HBV/HCV cirrhosis with HCC, hypertension, diabetes	EVE	No	Fever, shortness of breath, cough, myalgia, malaise, diarrhea	7	 	#10	M/72	Liver/5.5	Cryptogenic cirrhosis, hypertension, diabetes, obesity	MMF, EVE	No	Fever, shortness of breath, cough	1	 	#11	F/79	Liver/15.3	HCV cirrhosis, HCC, diabetes, chronic renal failure (KDIGO CKD stage 3b)	Prednisone, azathioprine, EVE	Ramipril	Shortness of breath, cough, malaise, diarrhea	3	 	#12	M/73	Liver/16.4	HBV cirrhosis, diabetes, asthma, bronchiectasis, splenectomy	MMF	No	Fever, shortness of breath, cough, malaise	21	 	#13	F/76	Liver/26.5	HCV cirrhosis, hypertension	Tacrolimus	No	Fever, thoracic pain	1	 	#14	F/46	Liver/6.4	Acute liver failure	Tacrolimus	No	Diarrhea	1	 	#15	M/64	Heart/13.8	Coronary heart disease, ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, inflammatory bowel disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis	Prednisone, cyclosporine, MPA	Losartan	Fever, shortness of breath, cough	7	 	#16	M/67	Heart/10.0	Coronary heart disease, ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension	Prednisone, cyclosporine, MMF	Valsartan	Fever, productive cough	7	 	#17	M/63	Heart/17.9	Coronary heart disease, ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, diabetes, lung cancer, peripheral artery disease	Prednisone, cyclosporine, MMF	Enalapril	Fever, shortness of breath, cough, diarrhea	6	 	#18	M/38	Heart/8.7	Congenital heart disease, cardiac allograft vasculopathy	Prednisone, tacrolimus, MPA	No	Fever, cough, sore throat, myalgia, malaise	1	 	\nAbbreviations: ACEi, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor;

The demographics and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. Most patients were KT recipients (44.4% [8/18]), followed by liver transplant (LT) and heart transplant (HT) recipients (33.3% [6/18] and 22.2% [4/18], respectively). Median age was 71.0 +- 12.8 years, with predominance of male patients (77.8% [14/18]), and the median interval since transplant was 9.3 years (IQR: 6.3-16.5). Fever was present in most cases (83.3% [15/18]), whereas gastrointestinal symptoms were not uncommon at illness onset (27.8% [5/18]). As detailed in Table 2, respiratory failure (oxygen saturation [at room air] &lt;91%) was observed in 27.8% (5/18) patients at presentation. The initial chest radiograph revealed some type of radiographic abnormalities in 72.2% (13/18) of cases, either as unilateral (33.3% [6/18]) or bilateral/multifocal consolidations (38.9% [7/18]). No thoracic CT scan was performed in any patient. Laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein [CRP], lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute lymphocyte count) according to the time from hospital admission in patients with available data (n = 17) are shown in Figure 1. Interleukin (IL)-6 levels were available for only 2 patients (15 and 7 pg/mL for patients 2 and 4, respectively).\nResults of therapeutic drug monitoring of tacrolimus in 5 recipients that received lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). Circles and horizontal bars represent individual and median values, respectively\nFIGURE 2\nRegarding therapeutic approaches, LPV/r was administered in 50.0% (9/18) of patients, usually in association with HCQ (88.9% [8/9]). LPV/r had to be prematurely discontinued in 2 patients (patient 2 and patient 8) due to the impossibility to achieve target tacrolimus levels and severe gastrointestinal symptoms, respectively. HCQ monotherapy was used in 27.8% (5/18) patients. In addition, SC IFN-beta was coadministered with other agents in 16.7% (3/18) patients. IVIg therapy and tocilizumab were added in 2 and 1 patient, respectively. The median interval from symptom onset to the initiation of therapy was 4 days (IQR: 2-7). Two patients did not receive any antiviral agent, either due to the rapid clinical deterioration (patient 12) or the absence of respiratory symptoms (patient 14). Most patients (55.6% [10/18]) underwent transitory discontinuation or dose reduction of the calcineurin inhibitor. Results of TDM in the 5 patients treated with LPV/r that were receiving tacrolimus as maintenance immunosuppression are depicted in Figure 2. Target trough levels (5-10 ng/mL) were achieved at 48-72 hours from the initiation of LPV/r therapy in only 1 patient (20.0%). One of the KT recipients (patient 8) with supratherapeutic levels (49.8 ng/mL) developed tacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity and required renal replacement therapy (4 hemodialysis sessions). On the other hand, 2 LT recipients (patients 9 and 10) were converted from mTOR inhibitor to tacrolimus in order to facilitate the coadministration of LPV/r 3 recipients (patient 7, patient 13, patient 14) were managed as outpatients. One of them, a 39-year-old KT recipient who had been discharged from the ED on HCQ monotherapy with mild respiratory symptoms and no findings on the chest radiography, was admitted to hospital 48 hours later due to clinical worsening and the development of bilateral consolidations (patient 7). Admission to ICU and invasive mechanical ventilation were required in 11.1% (2/18) of cases. As of April 4, the case-fatality rate was 27.8% (5/18). Patients with a fatal outcome received empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy at some time during their clinical course, although the cause of death was eventually attributed to SARS-CoV-2 in all the cases. Among surviving recipients, and after a median of 18 days (IQR: 14.5-22) from the initiation of symptoms, 4 patients (30.8%) experienced progressive respiratory failure and/or ARDS, 1 patient (7.7%) exhibited stable clinical condition or improvement, and eight (61.5%) had been discharged from hospital. Of note, 1 patient (patient 5) in the latter group had to be readmitted within the first 24 hours due to the reappearance of fever and development of new-onset consolidations on the chest radiograph. No patient developed acute graft rejection. The CRP levels at various times were significantly higher among recipients experiencing unfavorable outcome (n = 9) compared with those with favorable outcome (n = 9) (Figure 1A), whereas absolute lymphocyte counts were lower (Figure 1C). No significant differences were found for other clinical (e.g., age, time interval from transplant, delay in the initiation of therapy) and laboratory variables (data not shown).\nDISCUSSION\nThere are still many uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the SOT population, including its short- and medium-term impact in terms of patient and graft outcomes, the effect of baseline immunosuppression, or the role of antiviral agents that are not exempt from adverse events or drug interactions. The present case series from 1 of the regions suffering the highest incidence in Spain (cumulative incidence of 278.84 cases per 100 000 population over the last fortnight) is the largest to date examining the clinical characteristics of posttransplant SARS-CoV-2 infection. \nDespite the notable heterogeneity observed in both the recipient age at diagnosis (ranging from 38 to 80 years) and the time interval from transplant (1.8-30.1 years), the clinical picture was usually severe, in form of fever, respiratory symptoms and pneumonia with unifocal or multifocal/bilateral involvement on the chest radiograph. Moreover, about one-fourth of the cases showed respiratory failure at admission. Due to the emergency caused by the pandemic, a detailed description of the clinical features of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Spain is still lacking, although various research initiatives are ongoing. However, basic demographics and selected clinical characteristics extracted from administrative records are provided on a daily basis by the Spanish national epidemiological surveillance network. According to this report, SOT recipients in our cohort would have higher rates of pneumonia (72.2% [13/18] vs 31.1%), ARDS (38.9% [7/18] vs 5.6%) and ICU admission (11.1% [2/18] vs 5.1%) compared with the overall Spanish population, although these comparisons must be interpreted cautiously due to differences in the nature and granularity of both datasets.\nInterestingly, diarrhea was a common symptom, even as an isolated manifestation (case patient 14). It has been recently reported the case of a 50-year-old KT recipient in which the first manifestations were compatible with viral gastroenteritis, with development of respiratory failure within the next days. Whether posttransplant immunosuppression may modify the clinical presentation of COVID-19, making SOT recipients more prone to gastrointestinal complaints compared with nontransplant patients, remains to be confirmed. In the meanwhile, a low suspicion should be maintained for SARS-CoV-2 testing in recipients with atypical, nonrespiratory symptoms. On the other hand, caution should be exercised when ambulatory therapy is planned, as exemplified by the rapid clinical deterioration with development of bilateral consolidations in 1 of our patients (case patient 7). Close follow-up must be ensured even in recipients that are discharged home with mild symptoms and no evidence of pneumonia on the chest radiograph. The sensitivity of the thoracic CT scan to detect pulmonary infiltrates at an early stage is higher compared with conventional radiograph imaging. Nevertheless, this increased diagnostic yield should be balanced against the risk of intrahospital transmission during patient transfers and overloading of radiology departments. In addition, the apparent dissociation between the clinical course and the radiological features was not uncommon, with patients experiencing an improvement in respiratory and inflammatory parameters despite radiological progression on serial chest radiographs (patients 2, 3, and 8). In contrast, 1 patient with no radiological findings on follow-up had to be readmitted due to the worsening of symptoms and the onset of bilateral consolidations (patient 5). Therefore, clinical and practical considerations lead us not to systematically recommend ordering CT scans on a routine basis, although we cannot exclude that such an exploration may have a role in detecting incipient infiltrates in selected cases. In contrast to posttransplant influenza,   no bacterial superinfection or invasive aspergillosis following COVID-19 was observed, although the follow-up period might have not been long enough to allow these complications to emerge.\nLong-standing experience with influenza in SOT recipients has shown that the prompt initiation of neuraminidase inhibitors reduces the risk of ICU admission.   It could be assumed that this approach would be also valid for posttransplant COVID-19. Unfortunately, no antiviral drug has been clinically proved to be effective to treat this condition, although several agents are being used on the basis of in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 (or related viruses) or very limited clinical experience. A recently published clinical trial failed to demonstrate benefit in the time to clinical improvement with the use of LPV/r for patients with severe COVID-19. In accordance with national and local guidelines, most of the patients in our series were treated with a combination regimen including LPV/r, although some of them only received HCQ monotherapy. The observational nature of the present study:which makes it susceptible to confusion by indication:does not allow to draw any conclusion regarding the efficacy of such regimens. Nevertheless, the difficulty to manage baseline immunosuppression when LPV/r is coadministered was evident, with tacrolimus trough levels after 72 hours increasing above 30 ng/mL in 3 of 5 recipients despite transitory discontinuation and in-hospital TDM (Figure 2). Previous experiences with SOT recipients infected with human immunodeficiency virus suggest that weekly doses lower than 0.5-1.5 mg may be sufficient to maintain adequate tacrolimus levels. Until further evidence supporting the use of LPV/r for treating COVID-19 eventually emerges, any therapeutic decision should take into account both the severity of illness and the feasibility to perform close TDM of calcineurin and mTOR inhibitors.\nA notable finding of the present experience is the case-fatality rate found (27.8%), which is much higher than that reported for the overall population.   Of note, all the deaths but 1 occurred in male recipients older than 60 years, in keeping with previous studies in nontransplant patients.   The limited case reports published at the time of writing     also suggest that the severity of posttransplant SARS-CoV-2 infection is increased (pooled case-fatality rate of 20.0% [2/10]), not clearly supporting the hypothesis that long-term immunosuppression would exert a protective effect. However, these figures should be taken with caution since no reliable population estimates of the attack rate of COVID-19 are currently available. Therefore, it is likely that the mortality rate is overestimated due to the effect of inclusion bias (i.e., the sicker patients were more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection). Although SOT recipients are being instructed to contact their transplant center if symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 appear, patients with mild manifestations might have been managed in primary health care facilities without RT-PCR testing or discharged directly home from the ED, remaining unrecognized. In line with previous reports in the nontransplant population, recipients experiencing an unfavorable outcome showed increasing CRP levels and decreasing lymphocyte counts, which likely reflected an exacerbated inflammatory response that could benefit from the early use of the anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab or other immunomodulatory agents.\nAlthough limited by its small sample size, inclusion of a mixed transplant population and short follow-up period, some clinically relevant messages can be derived from our single-center experience at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Future larger studies should confirm whether SARS-CoV-2 infection has a more severe course among SOT recipients compared with immunocompetent hosts, as well as the potential impact of early initiation of antiviral and immunomodulatory agents provided that new evidence on the management of COVID-19 become available. A prospective study is being performed at various Spanish transplant centers to try to elucidate some of these questions.\nREFERENCES\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019\nGenomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding\nWorld Health Organization (WHO).

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Institut Pasteur.

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.101.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21.

five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020.

virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

Rate of Bacteriophage Q?","abstract":"Genome sizes and mutation rates covary across all domains of life.\n In unicellular organisms and DNA viruses, they show an inverse relationship known as Drakes rule.\n However, it is still unclear whether a similar relationship exists between genome sizes and mutation rates in RNA genomes.\n Coronaviruses, the RNA viruses with the largest genomes (?30 kb), encode a proofreading 3? exonuclease that allows them to increase replication fidelity.\n However, it is unknown whether, conversely, the RNA viruses with the smallest genomes tend to show particularly high mutation rates.\n To test this, we measured the mutation rate of bacteriophage Q?, a 4.2-kb levivirus.\n Amber reversion-based LuriaDelbrück fluctuation tests combined with mutant sequencing gave an estimate of 1.4 × 10?4 substitutions per nucleotide per round of copying, the highest mutation rate reported for any virus using this method.\n This estimate was confirmed using a direct plaque sequencing approach and after reanalysis of previously published estimates for this phage.\n Comparison with other riboviruses (all RNA viruses except retroviruses) provided statistical support for a negative correlation between mutation rates and genome sizes.\n We suggest that the mutation rates of RNA viruses might be optimized for maximal adaptability and that the value of this optimum may in turn depend inversely on genome size.\n","id":"PMC3761305","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Genetics Society of

emergence in both humans and livestock.\n Viruses similar to known epidemic strains circulating in wild and domestic animals further increase the probability of emergence in the future.\n Currently, there are no approved therapeutics for any human CoV presenting a clear unmet medical need.\n Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog with potent activity against an array of RNA virus families including Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae, through the targeting of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).\n We developed multiple assays to further define the breadth of RDV antiviral activity against the CoV family.\n Here, we show potent antiviral activity of RDV against endemic human CoVs OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E) with submicromolar EC50 values.\n Of known CoVs, the members of the deltacoronavirus genus have the most divergent RdRp as compared to SARS- and MERS-CoV and both avian and porcine members harbor a native residue in the RdRp that confers resistance in beta-CoVs.\n Nevertheless, RDV is highly efficacious against porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV).\n These data further extend the known breadth and antiviral activity of RDV to include both contemporary human and highly divergent zoonotic CoV and potentially enhance our ability to fight future emerging

Is Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease","abstract":"Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available.\n The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity.\n We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model.\n However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs.\n Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC50) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC50.\n The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model.\n Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging

the hemagglutinin stem of influenza A viruses, was safe and efficacious in a human H1N1 virus challenge study.\n\n This study evaluated the safety and tolerability of VIS410 in non-hospitalized adult patients with uncomplicated influenza A.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients 18 to 65?years of age with symptom onset within 72?h were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a single intravenous infusion of VIS410 4000?mg, 2000?mg, or placebo.\n\n Neuraminidase inhibitor therapy was prohibited.\n\n Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were evaluated up to 100?days post-infusion.\n\n Influenza symptoms were assessed daily for 10?days using the FLU-PRO tool.\n\n Nasopharyngeal virus shedding was assessed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and viral culture through Day 7.\nFindings\nOf the 150 patients randomized, 148 received study drug, and 138 were confirmed influenza A positive.\n\n Median age was 42?years; median time from symptom onset to treatment was 42?h; 93% had influenza A

polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) produced from the hyperimmune plasma of transchromosomic cattle immunised with a MERS coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation trial at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.\n\n We recruited healthy participants aged 1860 years who had normal laboratory parameters at enrolment, a body-mass index of 1932 kg/m2, and a creatinine clearance of 70 mL/min or more, and who did not have any chronic medical problems that required daily oral medications, a positive rheumatoid factor (?15 IU/mL), IgA deficiency (&lt;7 mg/dL), or history of allergy to intravenous immunoglobulin or human blood products.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned by a

The area under the concentrationtime curve (AUC) in the 50 mg/kg dose (27?498 ?g?×?days per mL) is comparable to the AUC that was associated with efficacy in a preclinical model.\n\n\nInterpretation\nSingle infusions of SAB-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well tolerated in healthy participants.\n\n Human immunoglobulin derived from transchromosomic cattle could

inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis and diabetes, and in viral infections, such as influenza infection.\n Thus, therapeutic control of the TLR4 signalling pathway is of major interest.\n Here we tested the activity of the small-molecule synthetic TLR4 antagonist, FP7, in vitro on human monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and in vivo during influenza virus infection of mice.\n Our results indicate that FP7 antagonized the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1?) by monocytes and DCs (IC50?&lt;?1??M) and prevented DC maturation upon TLR4 activation by ultrapure lipopolysaccharide (LPS).\n FP7 selectively blocked TLR4 stimulation, but not TLR1/2, TLR2/6, or TLR3 activation.\n TLR4 stimulation of human DCs resulted in increased glycolytic activity that was also antagonized by FP7. FP7 protected mice from influenza virus-induced lethality and reduced both proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in the lungs and acute lung injury (ALI).\n Therefore, FP7 can antagonize TLR4 activation in vitro and protect mice from severe influenza infection, most likely by reducing TLR4-dependent cytokine storm mediated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) like

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.\n\n We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drugs safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.\n\n\nConclusions\nHydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in

trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavirritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavirritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavirritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavirritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavirritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavirritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavirritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavirritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm

and meta-analyses.\n Moreover, we aim to discuss other currently and previously studied agents targeting COVID-19 that either show no or only limited therapeutic activity.\n The results of recent studies report that hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma demonstrate no efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Lastly, we summarize the studies on various drugs with incoherent or insufficient data concerning their effectiveness, such as amantadine, ivermectin, or niclosamide.\n","id":"PMC8654464","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

(RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","abstract":"Background\nCasirivimab and imdevimab are non-competing monoclonal antibodies that bind to two different sites on the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, blocking viral entry into host cells.\n\n We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of casirivimab and imdevimab administered in combination in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nRECOVERY is a randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial comparing several possible treatments with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 127 UK hospitals took part in the evaluation of casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n Eligible participants were any patients aged at least 12 years admitted to hospital with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone or usual care plus casirivimab 4 g and imdevimab 4 g administered together in a single intravenous infusion.\n\n Investigators and data assessors were masked to analyses of the outcome data during the trial.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality assessed by intention to treat, first only in patients without detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection at randomisation (ie, those who were seronegative) and then in the overall population.\n\n Safety was assessed in all participants who received casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov (NCT04381936).\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Sept 18, 2020, and May 22, 2021, 9785 patients enrolled in RECOVERY were eligible for casirivimab and imdevimab, of which 4839 were randomly assigned to casirivimab and imdevimab plus usual care and 4946 to usual care alone.\n\n 3153 (32%) of 9785 patients were seronegative, 5272 (54%) were seropositive, and 1360 (14%) had unknown baseline antibody status.\n\n 812 (8%) patients were known to have received at least one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\n In the primary efficacy population of seronegative patients, 396 (24%) of 1633 patients allocated to casirivimab and imdevimab versus 452 (30%) of 1520 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 0·79, 95% CI 0·690·91; p=0·0009).\n\n In an analysis of all randomly assigned patients (regardless of baseline antibody status), 943 (19%) of 4839 patients allocated to casirivimab and imdevimab versus 1029 (21%) of 4946 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (RR 0·94, 95% CI 0·861·02; p=0·14).\n\n The proportional effect of casirivimab and imdevimab on mortality differed significantly between seropositive and seronegative patients (p value for heterogeneity=0·002).\n\n There were no deaths attributed to the treatment, or meaningful between-group differences in the pre-specified safety outcomes of cause-specific mortality, cardiac arrhythmia, thrombosis, or major bleeding events.\n\n Serious adverse reactions reported in seven (&lt;1%) participants were believed by the local investigator to be related to treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, the monoclonal antibody combination of casirivimab and imdevimab reduced 28-day mortality in patients who were seronegative (and therefore had not mounted their own humoral immune response) at baseline but not in those who were seropositive at baseline.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Research and Innovation

antibodies","abstract":"id='Par1'>The SARS-CoV-2 B.\n1.1.529 (Omicron) variant contains 15 mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD).\n How Omicron evades RBD-targeted neutralizing antibodies requires immediate investigation.\n Here we use high-throughput yeast display screening1,2 to determine the profiles of RBD escaping mutations for 247 human anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies and show that the neutralizing antibodies can be classified by unsupervised clustering into six epitope groups (AF)a grouping that is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications35.\n Various single mutations of Omicron can impair neutralizing antibodies of different epitope groups.\n Specifically, neutralizing antibodies in groups AD, the epitopes of which overlap with the ACE2-binding motif, are largely escaped by K417N, G446S, E484A and Q493R.\n Antibodies in group E (for example, S309)6 and group F (for example, CR3022)7, which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but a subset of neutralizing antibodies are still escaped by G339D, N440K and S371L.\n Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could also be escaped, owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes.\n In total, over 85% of the tested neutralizing antibodies were escaped by Omicron.\n With regard to neutralizing-antibody-based drugs, the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10933, REGN10987, AZD1061, AZD8895 and BRII-196 was greatly undermined by Omicron, whereas VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still functioned at a reduced efficacy.\n Together, our data suggest that infection with Omicron would result in considerable humoral immune evasion, and that neutralizing antibodies targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region will remain most effective.\n Our results inform the development of antibody-based drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants.\n","id":"PMC8866119","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

to facilitate its infection.\n Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification.\n Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment.\n Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice.\n Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient.\n Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab.\n Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis.\n Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.","id":"PMC7714896","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

of a novel human CD147 knock-in NSG mouse model to test SARS-CoV-2 viral infection","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>An animal model that can mimic the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is critical to understanding the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and for development of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat emerging mutants.\n\n Studies show that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry.\n\n Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which are clearly invaluable.\n\n However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: (1) low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients; (2) low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients; and (3) hACE2Tg mice do not mimic the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.\n\n Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronavirus infection is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a possible co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry.\n\n It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par2'>Here we successfully generated a hCD147 knock-in mouse model (hCD147KI) in the NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG) background.\n\n In this hCD147KI-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed downstream of the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of hCD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 (JAX) model.\n\n In addition, the hCD147KI-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations in immunosuppressed states.\n\n Our data show (1) the human CD147 protein is expressed in various organs (including bronchiolar epithelial cells) in hCD147KI-NSG mice by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry; (2) hCD147KI-NSG mice are marginally sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to WT-NSG littermates characterized by increased viral copies by qRT-PCR and moderate body weight decline compared to baseline; (3) a significant increase in leukocytes in the lungs of hCD147KI-NSG mice, compared to infected WT-NSG mice.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par3'>hCD147KI-NSG mice are more sensitive to COVID-19 infection compared to WT-NSG mice.\n\n The hCD147KI-NSG mouse model can serve as an additional animal model for further interrogation whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at

symptomatic and for activating public health measures.\n Antigen rapid detection tests detect viral proteins and, although they are less sensitive than molecular tests, have the advantages of being easier to do, giving a faster time to result, of being lower cost, and able to detect infection in those who are most likely to be at risk of transmitting the virus to others.\n Antigen rapid detection tests can be used as a public health tool for screening individuals at enhanced risk of infection, to protect people who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure safe travel and the resumption of schooling and social activities, and to enable economic recovery.\n With vaccine roll-out, antibody tests (which detect the host's response to infection or vaccination) can be useful surveillance tools to inform public policy, but should not be used to provide proof of immunity, as the correlates of protection remain unclear.\n All three types of COVID-19 test continue to have a crucial role

17-year-old male with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) secondary to COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nCase report\nThis patient presented with cough, sore throat, anorexia and pyrexia.\n\n On examination, he had gross cervical lymphadenopathy and palpable splenomegaly.\n\n Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels.\n\n The patient's H-Score [2] was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 9396%.\n\n Considering Russell and colleagues' [3] comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with COVID-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\n\nResults\nThe patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24?h.\n\n His lymph nodes and spleen began to normalise after the first 48?h, at which time point the ferritin also started to decrease.\n\n He was discharged after 11?days feeling fit and well.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis case certainly illustrates the importance of hyperinflammation syndromes in COVID-19. It also raises the question  is the severe pneumonitis seen in patients with COVID-19 an immunological phenomenon? We know that the viral load of patients with COVID-19 seems to peak in the early stages of illness [4,5]; however, patients deteriorate later in the disease course, at around days 1014. This patient, who had risk factors for deterioration (male, pancytopaenic), did not develop an oxygen requirement and clinically and biochemically improved rapidly on Anakinra with no adverse events.\n\n We might suggest Anakinra to the scientific community as a treatment option in COVID-19 infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7245680","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Author(s).

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in 3%-30% of patients with COVID-19,   because of direct virus-induced cytopathic effects in the respiratory tract or cytokine storms triggered by the host's immune response. Comorbidities are known to increase the risk of ARDS in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. \nBelatacept:a CTLA4-Ig molecule designed to block the costimulatory B7-CD28 signal needed for activation of effector T cells:is used in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) to maintain effective long-term immunosuppression while minimizing calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs)-induced nephrotoxicity. However, a recent report has shown that the use of this drug may be associated with severe opportunistic infections. \nTimeline of immunosuppression management, patient symptoms, and laboratory findings before COVID-19 infection, at time of hospitalization, and after discharge [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]\nFIGURE 1\nLung CT scan performed 7 d after symptom onset. Evidence of minor, localized ground-glass opacities\nFIGURE 2\nHere, we describe the first case of COVID-19 in a KTR treated with belatacept. The 58-year-old male patient:with a history of cured testicular cancer followed by renal vein thrombosis and coronary artery disease:had undergone kidney transplantation in January 2017. Because of nephrotoxicity, he was switched from a cyclosporine (CNI) to belatacept in June 2017. His maintenance immunosuppression consisted of belatacept (345 mg every 28 days), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, 750 mg twice daily), and prednisone (5 mg/d). The last dose of belatacept was administered on February 18, 2020. The patient was referred to our center 3 weeks later (March 7, 2020) with fever (38 C), mild dyspnea, and cough 1 week after being in contact with a carrier of SARS-CoV-2 in Alsace, France. Figure 1 shows a timeline of immunosuppression management as well as the patient's clinical course and laboratory data. Belatacept and MMF were discontinued on the day of admission. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by RT-PCR amplification of the RdRp viral gene from a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. On admission, blood oxygen saturation on room air was 96% and remained stable during the hospitalization period. Limited peripheral pulmonary ground-glass opacities were identified on chest CT ( Figure 2). Serum IL-6 levels measured with a chemiluminescent enzyme assay were 29 ng/L, that is, markedly lower than those observed in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation (consistently &gt;100 ng/L; unpublished data, Dr Thomas Lavaux). The patient had a mild clinical course according to the World Health Organization interim guidance for COVID-19 with rapid recovery of respiratory symptoms after treatment of a possible bacterial superinfection. Low-dose cyclosporine (50 mg twice daily) was started on March 25. Five days after discharge, fever, cough, or breathing difficulties were absent. The results of laboratory tests were in line with those observed before SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1). We are planning to withdraw cyclosporine and restart both belatacept and MMF on April 14, that is, on the date of the next scheduled belatacept infusion.\nAltogether, severe manifestations of COVID-19 due to lymphopenia-associated immunosuppression could have been feared but did not occur in this patient. ARDS caused by coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by a cytokine storm, with secretion of numerous proinflammatory cytokines.   We hypothesize that the mild clinical course of COVID-19 observed in our immunocompromised patient may have been, at least in part, related to belatacept-related blockade of massive cytokines/chemokines production. Additional clinical investigation in larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are required to corroborate this possibility.\nREFERENCES\nZhou F, Yu T, Du R, et al.

Belatacept has been demonstrated to be as efficient as cyclosporine-based immunosuppression and is associated with significantly better renal function, that is, no nephrotoxicity.\n However, in the immediate posttransplant period, significantly more mild/moderate episodes of acute rejection have been reported, favored by the fact that cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein pathway has an inhibitory effect on the alloimmune response; thereby its inhibition is detrimental in this regard.\n This has led to the development of antibodies that target CD28.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47%

We stress the need for guidelines in transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection with particular regard to the management of therapy.\nINTRODUCTION\nAt the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) was identified as the causal pathogen of an ongoing pandemic. The first cases were reported in Wuhan, China, and then, they spread to other countries worldwide, posing great threats to public health. Very recently an outbreak in Italy is occurring with a subsequent concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected. Among them, organ transplant patients represent a frail susceptible category due to long-term immunosuppressive therapy. For this reason, clinical complications of COVID-19 infection may differ from those of the general population and need different treatment approaches. Herein, we present the case of a 36-year-old woman with Senior-Loken syndrome who underwent a 2nd kidney transplant in 1995 and developed a pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia in the early stage of the outbreak in Tuscany, Italy.\nCASE REPORT\nThe patient is a 36-year-old woman with Senior-Loken syndrome (SLS). SLS is a rare genetic disorder characterized by nephronophthisis and retinal degeneration leading to blindness and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Following ESKD, she underwent living-donor kidney transplantation in 1993 from her mother, a common consequence of her genetic disorder. The transplant was complicated by delayed graft function (DGF) and failed in 1995, so in the same year she received a second transplant from cadaveric donor. The induction therapy comprised basiliximab, cyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. Since 2013, the immunosuppressive therapy was switched to tacrolimus and corticosteroids. Her serum creatinine levels stabilized between 1.5-1.8 mg/dL and her tacrolimus trough levels ranged between 5-7 ng/mL.\nAt her most recent follow-up on 20 January 2020, her serum creatinine was 1.5 mg/dL and her tacrolimus trough level was 8.8 ng/mL.\nShe lived with her mother between Florence (Tuscany, Italy) and Robecco d'Oglio (Cremona, Lombardy, Italy). Her mother had visited some relatives in Robecco d'Oglio (hot spot of the COVID19 outbreak) at the end of February. On 5th March, due to loss of consciousness, her mother was hospitalized in the Infectious and Tropical Diseases unit of our hospital (Careggi Hospital, Florence) and a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was made.\nOn 6 March 2020, a rhino-pharyngeal swab sample for reverse real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from the patient, since she had been in contact with her mother and showed mild symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection (dry cough) beginning 1st of March; the swab was positive and so the patient was hospitalized.\nThe patient initial symptoms were as follows: fatigue, dry cough, and coryza. She never had fever. Physical examination on admission revealed a body temperature of 36.3 C, blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg, a pulse of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% in room air.\nHer laboratory results and radiological features were as follows: Lymphocyte count was normal according to age; neutrophil count was markedly high (17.20 x 109/L); creatinine level was 2.29 mg/dL, eGFR 27 mL/min; C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly elevated (67 mg/L); serum levels of some inflammatory cytokines were tested in two different occasions: interleukin (IL-1beta), IL-10, IL-6 were in normal range while IL-8 was slightly elevated (Table 1); chest X-ray showed reticulonodular left lung opacity with perivascular infiltrates especially in the perihilar region.\nBlood exams during hospitalization\n 	Day 2	Day 3	Day 4	Day 5	Day 6	Day 8	Day 9	Normal range	 	Tacrolimus (ng/mL)	-	90.5	81.5	74.5	72.4	33.8	18.8	5-15	 	Creatinine (mg/dL)	1.77	1.77	2.19	2.21	1.98	1.91	1.75	0.6-1.2	 	CRP (mg/L)	67	-	131	70	-	5	-	&lt;5	 	IL-6 (pg/mL)	-	-	10.3	-	2.5	-	-	0-10	 	IL-8 (pg/mL)	-	-	-	-	31	-	-	-	 	IL-10 (pg/mL)	-	-	2.5	-	2.1	-	-	0-15	 	IL-1 beta (pg/mL)	-	-	1	-	1	-	-	-	 	\nThese abnormalities confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The background therapy was tacrolimus 5 mg bid, methylprednisolone 4 mg daily, omeprazole 20 mg daily, allopurinol 150 mg daily, atorvastatin 20 mg daily, and ramipril 2.5 mg daily. On admission, antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg bid) along with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg bid) and ceftriaxone 2 g daily was started. Atorvastatin was stopped. Adjustments based on drug-drug interactions (DDI) with her routine therapy were considered, and the immunosuppressive therapy was initially reduced with tacrolimus 3 mg bid and methylprednisolone 6.5 mg daily. Therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir was then replaced on day 2 with darunavir/cobicistat 800 mg/150 mg due to the onset of nausea and diarrhea. Tacrolimus trough level on this day was not available due to analytical issues.\nOn day 4, she started to complain intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, and vomit. Blood gases were normal with pH 7.43, pO2 88.2 mm Hg, pCO2 26.6 mm Hg, HCO3- 20 mmol/L, K + 4.6 mEq/L, Na 138 mEq/L, Ca 4.89 mg/dL, Cl 112 mEq/L. Tacrolimus trough levels turned to be extremely high (90.5 ng/mL); ECG was normal. We immediately discontinued both antiviral therapy and tacrolimus, starting daily monitoring of tacrolimus trough levels (Table 1). In the following days, the patient recovered from her gastrointestinal symptoms and showed a general amelioration of clinical condition, notably a decrease of fatigue and cough, with stable SpO2 levels (98% room air). Tacrolimus trough levels progressively decreased during the following days, reaching the value of 18.8 ng/mL the day of discharge (Table 1). The patient was discharged together with her mother on day 9 and put in home isolation until two consecutively negative rhino-pharyngeal swabs, scheduled on day 12th and 18th after discharge. Tacrolimus trough levels were monitored with twice weekly home blood sampling, showing a value of 19 microg/mL a week after discharge and of 15 microg/mL after 2 weeks. The last creatinine level was 1.75 mg/dL, eGFR 37 mL/min. The patient, since hospital discharge, is on corticosteroid therapy alone.\nDISCUSSION\nThe infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 was declared global pandemic by WHO. In the past, other coronaviruses caused epidemic outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were also reported in solid organ transplant recipients. Data on the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients are lacking.\nWe hereby discuss the first Italian reported COVID-19 infection in a kidney transplant recipient. To date, only two other case reports are available, one Chinese and one Spanish.\nLan Zhu et al described a successful recovery of a kidney transplant patient following a treatment regimen consisting of reduced immunosuppressant use and low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy. The patient's illness was severe, and they argued that both the anti-inflammatory and graft-protective effect of steroids (along with novel therapies) seemed to be crucial for the patient's clinical improvement. At first, immunosuppression was reduced by lowering the dosage of the calcineurin inhibitor and mildly increasing methylprednisolone like in other cases of opportunistic infections in kidney transplant recipients. This approach, the mainstay for severe viral infections, appears to be safe in patients with mild SARS-CoV-2 infections, although more evidence-based data are needed. \nAnother approach used is the prompt suspension of calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolic acid, and m-TOR inhibitors, continuing immunosuppression in monotherapy with methylprednisolone. There is currently no evidence to support immediate discontinuation of maintenance corticosteroids in kidney transplant recipients. On the other hand, it is not currently possible to have evidence that in COVID-19 patients corticosteroids monotherapy has better outcomes than corticosteroids combined with a second immunosuppressive drug.\nThe peculiarity of this case resides in the clinical presentation, as the patient did not develop a severe form of COVID-19 despite receiving immunosuppressive drugs. More recently, indeed, Guillen et al described a case of COVID-19 in a recipient of a 3rd deceased-donor kidney transplant pointing out the importance of atypical symptoms in the setting of an immunosuppressive therapy. \nAtypical presentations in immunocompromised host, consisting in delayed symptom development, prolonged incubation period and persistent viral shedding without clinical deterioration have been well described in other CoV infections, and they should always be put into account in order to control potential outbreaks in such kind of patients.\nIn our case, the atypical manifestations misled us so that we did not stop neither reduce immunosuppressive drugs causing an overdose of tacrolimus. Pharmacokinetic profiles of tacrolimus are influenced by CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, and it is presumable that drug-drug interactions can change the drug blood level. Drug, such as lopinavir/ritonavir that competitively inhibits CYP3A4 activity, can increase the bioavailability of tacrolimus and other calcineurin inhibitors, with potential for toxicity. It is therefore necessary to weigh the risks and benefits in using these drugs in the transplant population. The most recent evidences regarding lopinavir/ritonavir treatment show that they did not significantly accelerate clinical improvement, reduce mortality, or diminish throat viral RNA detectability in patients with serious COVID-19. \nOther novel therapies (such as remdesivir, tocilizumab) could be useful but they are reserved to patients with severe pneumonia, and there are no data on safety on solid transplant recipients. Treatment with the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could be a more feasible option.\nEven in the acute phase, the patient did not show considerable respiratory manifestations despite the presence of radiological pneumonia findings. The symptomatology only worsened due to drug-related gastrointestinal toxicity. From day 4 (stop of immunosuppression), we observed a reduction in inflammatory parameters (CRP, IL-6). It could be possible that increased corticosteroid therapy has reduced IL-6 levels, recently involved as one of the main factors in the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia. \nTo date, acute kidney injury (AKI) was found to be an independent predictor of mortality in CODIV-19 infection. However, in our case the most reasonable effect on GFR was due to excessive tacrolimus exposure, owing to the well-known interaction between tacrolimus and ritonavir. \nAs high viral load and close contact are a risk factor for transmission, appropriate airborne infection isolation room and careful wearing and removal of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is required in managing such patients. Considering these aspects, patients who cannot avoid corticosteroid therapy should be aggressively managed from symptom onset, including evidence based, if present, or experimental therapeutic measures such as antiviral therapy.\nIn conclusion, we want to point out the importance of a quick diagnosis of COVID-19 especially in the presence of atypical symptoms. In the next months, we suggest COVID-19 to be rule out by performing rhino-pharyngeal swab sample to all the kidney transplanted recipients presenting with a suspicious history. We also intend to underline the need for guidelines in renal transplant recipient with COVID-19 infection with particular regard to management of therapy.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nM.B, B.B, An.B, and MT treated the patient.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

The clinical course of patients remains to be fully characterized, clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute renal failure, and no pharmacological therapies of proven efficacy yet exist. We report a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a renal transplant recipient with excellent outcome. This case states the importance of close monitoring of the concentration of cyclosporine in patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir; the routine treatment of corticosteroid can be continued. This is a rare report of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a renal transplant recipient. Further data are needed to achieve better understanding of the impact of immunosuppressive therapy on the clinical presentation, severity, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections in solid organ transplant recipients.\nINTRODUCTION\nCoronaviruses are frequent causes of self-limited community-acquired upper respiratory tract infections. A novel coronavirus strain named SARS-CoV-2 (formerly called 2019-nCoV) was isolated from human airway epithelial cells and reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. As it spread rapidly, outbreaks and case clusters were reported.   As of April 24, 2020, the World Health Organization has reported 2 631 839 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally. \nBecause specific drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been revealed, the National Health Committee of China published a series of &quot;Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan&quot; to standardize the clinical diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. According to this plan, interferon-alpha inhalation, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are recommended as experimental antiviral treatment.   Furthermore, the clinical picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies widely, ranging from asymptomatic carrier state to severe rapidly fatal pneumonia.   SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with severe morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, complicated with cardiovascular or pulmonary comorbidities and in immunoincompetent populations.   Clinical information of COVID-19 on solid organ transplant recipients and the effect of the immunosuppression regimens on the clinical course of COVID-19 are still lacking. We report a case of a renal transplant recipient with atypical pneumonia as a manifestation of COVID-19.\nCASE REPORT\nA 29-year-old male patient, with a clinical history of arterial hypertension and later chronic kidney disease, underwent hemodialysis for 9 months and then received a living kidney transplant donated by his mother on December 27, 2018. His routine immunosuppressive regimen consisted of mycophenolate mofetil 0.5 g q12h, cyclosporine (CsA) q12h (75 mg every morning and 75 mg/100 mg alternating every other night), and methylprednisolone 8 mg daily. Simultaneously, he was given a maintenance treatment with esomeprazole 20 mg daily, aspirin 0.1 g daily, metoprolol succinate 47.5 mg daily, felodipine 5 mg twice daily, valsartan 80 mg every night, and diammonium glycyrrhizinate 150 mg 3 times daily.\nSymptoms and maximum body temperatures according to day of illness and day of hospitalization, February 4 to February 20, 2020 [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]\nFIGURE 1\nShown are chest CT obtained on day 3 (February 6, A), day 9 (February 12, B), day 15 (February 18, C) of illness, and fifth day after discharge (February 24, D)\nFIGURE 2\nHe presented to the fever clinic of the local hospital in Fuyang city, Anhui province, on February 6, 2020, complaining of generalized fatigue and chills for 2 days and a low-grade fever of 37.7C ( Figure 1). He had no rigors, cough, sputum, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, myalgia, malaise, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, or headache. There was no history of contact with similarly ill or febrile patients. An oropharyngeal swab obtained from the patient tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and chest computed tomography (CT) images showed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity ( Figure 2A). Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was initiated as empiric treatment for possible Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.\nClinical laboratory results\nTABLE 1	 	\nMeasure	Reference range	Illness day 5, hospital day 1	Illness day 6, hospital day 2	Illness day 7, hospital day 3	Illness day 10, hospital day 6	Illness day 12, hospital day 8	Illness day 15, hospital day 11	Discharge day 6 February 25	 	White-cell count (109/L)	3.5-9.5	11.14a	:	6.73	:	8.78	13.21a	6.19	 	Lymphocyte count (109/L)	1.1-3.2	1.5	:	1.01b	:	1.82	1.62	1.31	 	Platelet count (109/L)	125-350	104b	:	142	:	82b	254	147	 	Hemoglobin (g/L)	130-175	157	:	136	:	144	132	114b	 	Sodium (mmol/L)	135-145	:	126b	122b	128b	133b	136	133.2b	 	Creatinine (mumol/L)	57-111	:	102	167a	122a	104	101	113.8	 	Albumin (g/L)	40-55	:	38.7b	41	33.6b	42.2	33.5b	32.3b	 	Total bilirubin (mumol/L)	3.4-21	:	7.8	13	24.1a	16	9.2	11.3	 	Alanine aminotransferase (U/L)	9-50	:	20	20	19	72a	49	119	 	Aspartate aminotransferase (U/L)	15-45	:	23	32	19	47a	28	60	 	\nThe value in the patient was above normal.\nThe value in the patient was below normal.\nDue to persistent fatigue and chills and to monitor his renal transplant, the patient was transferred to the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China on February 8, 2020. After admission, he was started on broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with moxifloxacin in addition to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; the immunosuppressive regimen and maintenance treatment were not changed. Mild chest tightness, nasal stuffiness, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting developed 12 hours later (Figure 1). His laboratory testing revealed an elevated white cell count, mild thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, and hypoalbuminemia ( Table 1). Oropharyngeal swab and sputum were both positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR results within 24 hours. According to the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (trial version 5) and in accordance with current best practice, the patient was put on antiviral therapy with oral lopinavir/ritonavir (1000 mg/d) and supportive therapy with probiotics on hospital day 2. Moxifloxacin was discontinued in consideration of the lack of evidence of bacterial pneumonia.\nDizziness and hematuria developed on day 3 of hospitalization, apart from the development of intermittent nausea and vomiting (Figure 1). Laboratory results showed an elevated creatinine level and hyponatremia on that evening (Table 1). The 24-hour urine volume on hospital day 3 was 500 mL. To improve the oliguria and hyponatremia, individually tailored fluid administration based on real-time urine volume was conducted, and 24-hour urine volume for hospital days 4 and 5 was 2000 and 2500 mL, respectively.\nChest CT was performed on hospital day 5 (Figure 2B) and revealed extensive but slightly improved ground-glass shadowing over both lungs and a strip-like sign over bilateral superior lobes and right lower lobe. Both the sputum and oropharyngeal swab specimens later tested negative on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.\nGiven unavailable laboratory testing of CsA concentration in blood, our major concern was the metabolic interactions on cytochrome P450 (CYP) between CsA and lopinavir/ritonavir. This issue was addressed in a multidisciplinary team meeting, performed online on hospital day 6, in which it was decided to discontinue esomeprazole and reduce lopinavir/ritonavir by 25% to 750 mg daily. Dosage of baseline immunosuppression remained unchanged. Laboratory results on day 6 of hospitalization showed improved creatinine level and hyponatremia; again, the sputum and oropharyngeal swab specimens tested negative on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.\nGiven the stable clinical presentation, chest CT revealed significant improvement on day 12 of hospitalization (Figure 2C) and an almost normal laboratory test, persistently negative for SARS-CoV-2; hence, he was discharged on hospital day 13 after recovering from COVID-19. Based on Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (trial version 5), he was treated for 10 days (February 9 to February 18th) with lopinavir/ritonavir and for 3 days with gamma-globulin.\nConcentration of CSA in venous blood\nTABLE 2	 	\nTime	November 26, 2019	December 27, 2019	January 21, 2020	February 8, 2020, hospital day 1	February 19, 2020, hospital day 12	February 26, 2020, discharge day 7	 	C0 (ng/mL)a	101.2	121.4	114.4	126.7	:	260.58	 	C2 (ng/ml)b	:	:	:	:	1375.6	319.19	 	\nC0, concentration of cyclosporine on fasting specimens.\nC2 blood specimen was collected about 2 h after the patient taking the CsA.\nTesting of the CsA concentration in patients with COVID-19 was not available before February 22, 2020 due to organizational issues, so when the patient was discharged from our hospital, we tested the concentration of CsA on stored blood specimens frozen in a -80C refrigerator collected on February 8 and February 19, 2020. The results revealed a C0 of 126.7 ng/mL on February 8 and a C2 of 1375.6 ng/mL on February 19, respectively ( Table 2).\nThe patient was seen in the outpatient clinic on February 26 (7 days after discharge), and his appetite had improved, and he had no fever, cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, headache, or diarrhea. His 24-hour urine volume fluctuated from 2000 mL to 3000 mL each day since February 20. The laboratory testing on February 25 revealed mild anemia and hypoalbuminemia, and creatinine and aminotransferase levels were slightly elevated (Table 1). Chest CT showed that the ground-glass lesions were significantly absorbed; fibrosis was absent (Figure 2D). Both oropharyngeal swab and sputum were negative for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR twice, on February 25 and February 26. C0 and C2 of CsA were measured on February 26; C0 was 260.58 ng/mL and C2 was 319.19 ng/mL. No changes were made to the dosing at this time, and further evaluation will be performed.\nDISCUSSION\nWe report a case of COVID-19 occurring in a kidney transplant recipient. Diagnosis was confirmed using RT-PCR assays. Although the source of his SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown, evidence of person-to-person transmission has been confirmed. Long-term administration of immunosuppression in solid organ transplant recipients may increase the risk of infection, though there is no clinical evidence for an increased morbidity/mortality in respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory viruses such as the known group of coronaviruses so far (with exception of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS]).   Although the number of patients currently is too small to allow a prediction whether the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection is different or more severe in transplant recipients, this issue clearly needs further observation and careful monitoring in order to assess its impact on this specific patient group.\nSpecific drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 will take several years to develop and evaluate. In an attempt to treat the COVID-19, interferon and ribavirin were deemed to be not suitable for a renal transplantation recipient due to their side effects, including the potential to trigger an acute rejection. Therefore, the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir were initiated based on Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (trial version 5). Lopinavir and ritonavir are the inhibitors of CYP3A enzyme causing irreversible inhibition of CYP3A4 with increased blood levels of ciclosporin/tacrolimus. While we were unable to monitor C0 of CsA in blood because laboratory testing was restricted by biosafety level, we empirically adjusted the dosage of lopinavir/ritonavir to three quarters of the recommended dose. We retrospectively tested CsA levels on stored specimens which coincidentally had been collected from one day before and after the treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. We found the C0 of CsA before treatment within the patients usual CsA exposure while the C2 level after treatment was higher than the C2 recommended level. To confirm the interaction between CsA and lopinavir/ritonavir, follow-up monitoring of C0 and C2 levels were implemented 1 week after discharge (8 days after lopinavir/ritonavir discontinued). The C0 was elevated, but C2 was decreased indicating that lopinavir/ritonavir may strongly interact via CYP450 with the concentration of CsA even after discontinuation of the protease inhibitors. Nevertheless, no serious hepatic and renal dysfunction was observed in our case and we assume further normalization of CsA levels.\nMethylprednisolone was routinely used as baseline immunosuppression in this case, although its use for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains controversial. No clinical data exist to indicate that net benefit is derived from corticosteroids in the treatment of respiratory infection due to coronavirus included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Furthermore, corticosteroid treatment may be associated with delayed clearance of MERS-CoV viral RNA from respiratory tract secretions. Nevertheless, there are other studies supporting the use of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate dose in patients with coronavirus infection, proper use of corticosteroids was found to reduce mortality and shorten the length of stay in hospital for critically ill patients with SARS without causing secondary infection and other complications. While the average clearance time of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory tract secretions was not reported, the majority of patients were tested persistently positive for SARS-CoV-2 for longer than 1 week. In this case, the SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory tract secretions was not detected after hospital day 5, no obvious delayed clearance was observed in this case under immunosuppression. Secondly, secondary infection and other complications were not presented in this case under immunosuppression as well. These findings indicate that routine low dose of corticosteroids probably may have no significant negative impact on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; on the other hand, a positive impact cannot be concluded from one single case.\nIn conclusion, we report COVID-19 in a renal transplant recipient successfully treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. The patient had a relatively mild illness, atypical pneumonia resolved rapidly under the antiviral therapy and an excellent clinical recovery was observed. No significant complications were found during the infection although baseline immunosuppression was continued. Maintenance treatment with corticosteroids was continued as well since no negative impact was found. Furthermore, lopinavir/ritonavir has a strong effect on CsA blood concentration, hence these patients need close monitoring and if necessary, adjustment such as dosage reduction or discontinuation. More data are needed to gain better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infections in solid organ transplant recipients.\nREFERENCES\nRespiratory viral infections in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019\nA familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster\nImportation and human-to-human transmission of a novel coronavirus in Vietnam\nWHO.

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund Limited, Marina Man-Wai Lee, the Hong Kong Hainan Commercial Association South China Microbiology Research Fund, Sanming Project of Medicine (Shenzhen), and High Level-Hospital Program (Guangdong Health Commission).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159286","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper Fuk-Woo","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuofeng","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kin-Hang","surname":"Kok","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelvin Kai-Wang","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hin","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fanfan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jieling","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyril Chik-Yan","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosana Wing-Shan","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hoi-Wah","surname":"Tsoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon Kam-Fai","surname":"Lo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Kwok-Man","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan-Mui","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan Daniel","surname":"Ip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Piao","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Chi-Chung","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Honglin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher Kim-Ming","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on kidney transplant patients with COVID-19 to date.\nIn January 2020, a renal transplant patient with COVID-19 was admitted to the First Hospital of Zhoukou, Zhoukou, China. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the local hospital.\nSummary of laboratory test results for the patient with COVID-19.\nTable 1	 	\n	Reference range	Day 8 of illness	Day 12 of illness	 	White blood cell count (x109 /l)	4-10	7.18	6.32	 	Neutrophils (x109/l)	2-7	6.06	5.64	 	Neutrophil ratio (%)	50-70	84.4	89.2	 	Lymphocytes (x109/l)	0.80-4	0.59	0.64	 	Lymphocyte ratio (%)	20-40	8.2	7.3	 	C-reactive protein (mg/l)	&lt;10	22.73	7.8	 	Procalcitonin (ng/mL)	0-0.5	0.36	0.38	 	Serum creatinine (mumol/l)	21.5-104	128.1	101	 	Blood urea nitrogen (mumol/l)	2.82-8.2	7.17	7.93	 	\nThe patient was a 49-yr-old male kidney transplant recipient who developed fever and respiratory symptoms between February 6 and February 12, 2020 and was admitted to the hospital on February 13, 2020. His history included close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Chest computed tomography showed multifocal ground-glass opacities, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests on pharyngeal swabs were positive for COVID-19 on February 13, 2020. The patient had a reduced lymphocyte count and elevated C-reactive protein levels (Table 1 ). He had received a kidney graft 2 yr previously and has been on triple immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine A (CsA, 100 mg twice daily, orally), mycophenolate mofetil (0.75 g twice daily, orally), and prednisone (4 mg once daily, orally) since the surgery. His medical history also included type 2 diabetes for 20 yr and hypertension for 10 yr.\nThe patient was admitted to the special isolation ward and underwent comprehensive treatment for COVID-19, including supplemental oxygen through nasal catheters, lopinavir plus ritonavir (500 mg twice daily, orally), ribavirin (0.5 g twice daily, intravenously), interferon alpha-2b (50 mug twice daily, atomization inhalation), and methylprednisolone (40 mg once daily, intravenously). The patient was maintained on immunosuppression with CsA, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone throughout the course of his treatment.\nHe became afebrile on February 15 (day 10 of illness) and a dry cough persisted until day 12 of illness. His respiratory status was stable without supplemental oxygen inhalation, and he had stable renal function. His nasopharyngeal swabs were negative on day 14 of illness, and the patient remained well during follow-up.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of COVID-19 in a renal transplant patient who was maintained on conventional-dose immunosuppression throughout the course of his treatment. Organ transplant patients with COVID-19 infection might have poorer prognosis because of their systemic immunosuppressive state. However, this severe case was cured even without discontinuing or reducing his immunosuppressant therapy. There are two possible reasons that might help to explain this result. First, it has been reported that overwhelming inflammation and cytokine release could lead to multiple organ dysfunction and death in patients with COVID-19. However, his immunosuppressive state could have protected this kidney transplant patient from severe immune injury. Second, as a potent immunosuppressive agent, CsA is able to inhibit the replication of diverse coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human coronavirus NL63, and feline coronavirus. Whether CsA has an antiviral effect for the coronavirus causing COVID-19 requires further study.\nThis immunosuppressed case might help physicians to establish optimal treatment strategies for similar severe cases.\n  :  :  Conflicts of interest: The authors have nothing to disclose.\nReferences\nCyclosporin A inhibits the replication of diverse coronaviruses\nEffect of interferon alpha and cyclosporine treatment separately and in combination on Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in a human in-vitro and ex-vivo culture model\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30076-X","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome","abstract":"","id":"PMC7164771","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhe","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yijin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiyuan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuhong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongxia","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanhong","surname":"Tai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Changqing","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tingting","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jinwen","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jinghui","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jingmin","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fu-Sheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3","date":"2020-01-28","title":"A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China","abstract":"id='Par1'>Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health13.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019.

causing severe viral pneumonia, with index cases having resided in or recently travelled to the Arabian peninsula, and is a global concern for public health.\n\n Limited human-to-human transmission, leading to some case clusters, has been reported.\n\n MERS-CoV has been reported in dromedary camels but phenotypic characterisation of such viruses is limited.\n\n We aimed to compare MERS-CoV isolates from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia and Egypt with a prototype human MERS-CoV to assess virus replication competence and cell tropism in ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung.\n\n\nMethods\nWe characterised MERS-CoV viruses from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia and Egypt and compared them with a human MERS-CoV reference strain.\n\n We assessed viral replication kinetics and competence in Vero-E6 cells (rhesus monkey), tissue tropism in cultures of ex-vivo human bronchial and lung tissues, and cytokine and chemokine induction, gene expression, and quantification of viral RNA in Calu-3 cells (human respiratory tract).\n\n We used mock-infected tissue as negative controls for ex-vivo experiments and influenza A H5N1 as a positive control for cytokine and chemokine induction experiments in Calu-3 cells.\n\n\nFindings\nWe isolated three dromedary strains, two from Saudi Arabia (Dromedary/Al-Hasa-KFU-HKU13/2013 [AH13] and Dromedary/Al-Hasa-KFU-HKU19D/2013 [AH19D]), and one from Egypt (Dromedary/Egypt-NRCE-HKU270/2013 [NRCE-HKU270]).\n\n The human and dromedary MERS-CoV strains had similar viral replication competence in Vero-E6 cells and respiratory tropism in ex-vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract, and had similar ability to evade interferon responses in the human-respiratory-tract-derived cell line Calu-3.\nInterpretation\nThe similarity of virus tropism and replication competence of human and dromedary MERS-CoV from the Arabian peninsula, and genetically diverse dromedary viruses from Egypt, in ex-vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract suggests that dromedary viruses from Saudi Arabia and Egypt are probably infectious to human beings.\n\n Exposure to zoonotic MERS-CoV is probably occurring in a wider geographical region beyond the Arabian peninsula.\n\n\nFunding\nKing Faisal University, Egyptian National Research Centre, Hong Kong Food and Health Bureau, National Institute of Allergy and

respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection is associated with high mortality and has no approved antiviral therapy.\n\n We aimed to compare ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a treatment for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection with a supportive therapy only.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (aged ?16 years) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection and pneumonia needing ventilation support, diagnosed between Oct 23, 2012, and May 1, 2014, at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia).\n\n All patients received appropriate supportive care and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring, but patients diagnosed after Sept 16, 2013, were also given oral ribavirin (dose based on calculated creatinine clearance, for 810 days) and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 ?g per week for 2 weeks).\n\n The primary endpoint was 14-day and 28-day survival from the date of MERS-CoV infection diagnosis.\n\n We used ?2 and Fischer's exact test to analyse categorical variables and the t test to analyse continuous variables.\n\n\nFindings\nWe analysed 20 patients who received ribavirin and interferon (treatment group; initiated a median of 3 days [range 08] after diagnosis) and 24 who did not (comparator group).\n\n Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between groups, apart from baseline absolute neutrophil count, which was significantly lower in the comparator group (5·88?×?109/L [SD 3·95] vs 9·88?×?109/L [6·63]; p=0·023).\n\n 14 (70%) of 20 patients in the treatment group had survived after 14 days, compared with seven (29%) of 24 in the comparator group (p=0·004).\n\n After 28 days, six (30%) of 20 and four (17%) of 24, respectively, had survived (p=0·054).\n\n Adverse effects were similar between groups, apart from reduction in haemoglobin, which was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the comparator group (4·32 g/L [SD 2·47] vs 2·14 g/L [1·90]; p=0·002).\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy is associated with significantly improved survival at 14 days, but not at 28 days.\n\n Further assessment in appropriately designed randomised trials is recommended.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7106357","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Ali

Inhibits Rotavirus Replication and Restores Interferon-Beta Signaling Pathway <italic>In Vitro</italic> and <italic>In Vivo</italic>\n","abstract":"Rotavirus (RV) is the most common cause of severe diarrhea among infants and young children.\n Currently, there is no specific drug available against rotavirus, largely due to the lack of an ideal target molecule which has hampered drug development.\n Our previous studies have revealed that cyclosporin A (CsA) might be potentially useful as an anti-RV drug.\n We therefore used both cellular and mouse models to study the immunological safety and effectiveness of CsA as an anti-RV drug.\n We found that CsA treatment of HT-29 cells before, during, and after viral infection efficiently inhibited Wa strain RV replication and restored IFN-? expression in a HT-29 cell line model.\n Exploring the underlying mechanisms showed that CsA promoted Interferon Regulatory Factor-5 (IRF-5) expression (a key positive regulator of the type I IFN signaling pathway), but not IRF-1, IRF-3, or IRF-7. Additionally, CsA inhibited SOCS-1 expression (the key negative regulator of IFN-?/?), but not SOCS-2 or SOCS-3. The antiviral effect of CsA was confirmed in an RV-infected neonatal mouse model by evaluation of antigen clearance and assessment of changes in intestinal tissue pathology.\n Also, no differences in T cell frequency or proliferation between the CsA- and vehicle-treated groups were observed.\n Thus, both our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that CsA, through modulating the expression of key regulators in IFN signaling pathway, promote type I IFN-based intracellular innate immunity in RV host cells.\n These findings suggest that CsA may be a useful candidate to develop a new anti-RV strategy, although further evaluation and characterization of CsA on RV-induced diarrhea are warranted.\n","id":"PMC3749198","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Zigang","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haiyang","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuzhang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jintao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wenzhe","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wenzhe","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa1211721","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]}]}]}
