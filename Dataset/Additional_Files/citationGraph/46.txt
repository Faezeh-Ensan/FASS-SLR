However, little is known about the prevalence rate of mental health disorders among hospital discharged COVID-19 patients and its associated factors. A cross-sectional survey of hospital discharged patients was conducted April 11-22, 2020 in Wuhan, China (where the pandemic began). 675 participants completed the survey, including 90 (13.3%) medical staff (physicians and nurses who had been ill). We used Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms associated with COVID-19 hospitalization). Adverse mental health effects of COVID-19 are evident after discharge from the hospital, with sleep difficulties highlighted as a central issue. As we found that perceived discrimination was a central predictor of mental illness, preventing and addressing social stigma associated with COVID-19 may be crucial for improving mental health for recovered patients.\nIntroduction\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. As of May 18, 2020, the outbreak has resulted in almost 5 million confirmed infections around the world, and the number of deaths and infections caused by COVID-19 continues to rise. The present study investigated mental illness outcomes among people who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 and then discharged.\nAlong with the symptoms of the disease itself, patients infected by COVID-19 may experience a variety of stressors and traumatic events, such as difficulty gaining admission to hospital wards, social and physical isolation, and deaths of other patients and/or family members. Furthermore, treatment for COVID-19 may have adverse effects on mental health and contribute to problems such as anxiety and insomnia (Zhao, et al., 2020). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might also infect the brain, which could directly cause and have adverse effects on brain function and mental health. Previous studies following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infected patients in 2003 found that the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in SARS survivors was respectively 46.2% and 38.8% at 3 months and 12 months after discharge (Gao, et al., 2020). A recent study found that 96.2% clinically stable COVID-19 patients reported clinically significant symptoms of PTSD.\nTo date, no studies have reported the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and PTSD for the hospital discharged COVID-19 patients. There is also limited information regarding risk factors for mental health problems among discharged COVID-19 patients. It is urgent for researchers to clarify these issues to understand the mechanisms of the development of mental health issues for COVID-19 patients \nMethod\nStudy design\nThe study protocol was approved by the research ethics committee of Renmin University of China on March 20, 2020. Nurses described the survey to each participant and obtained their oral consent. The participants completed the survey either online at home or offline at temporary quarantine places. The study is a cross-sectional survey conducted from April 11 to 22, 2020.\nParticipants\nAll participants were recovered COVID-19 patients who had been discharged from hospitals, average time since discharge was 36.75 days. The discharge date ranged from Jan. 27, 2020 to April 21, 2020. According to the treatment guidelines in China, COVID-19 patients had to be isolated in quarantine places for 14 days after hospital discharge and then isolated in their homes for another 14 days afterward. Nurses distributed the questionnaires online or gave them when doing follow-up home visits after discharge. An estimate of 90% of patients visited responded to the survey. This is a very high compliance rate.\nDemographic variables\nDemographic data were self-reported by the participants, including occupation (hospital staff or not), gender (male or female), age, marital status, educational level (high school degree or lower, educational specialist diploma, Bachelor's degree, or Master's degree or higher, scores were respectively coded as from 1 to 4), income level (2000 -5000 yuan, 5000-10,000 yuan, 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and more than 20,000 yuan per month, scores were respectively coded as from 1 to 4). (1000 yuan convert to US$141 as of May 2020.)\nIllness severity, symptoms, treatment\nThe questionnaire elicited self-reports of key clinical variables, including ICU admission, severity level of COVID-19 pneumonia (mild, moderate, severe, and critically ill), admission date, discharge date, current symptoms after hospital discharge (cough, chest distress, chest pain, dizziness, fatigue, dyspnea etc.), use of invasive mechanical ventilation, use of corticosteroids, presence of chronic underlying disease (e.g. diabetes, hypertension), and positive COVID-19 RNA test after hospital discharge.\nSocial factors\nParticipants were asked about whether they currently live with parents or children, whether any of their family members were infected, and whether these family members died from COVID. We constructed a brief 5-item perceived discrimination scale for the current study based upon phone interview with COVID-19 patients and similar scales previously used to assess HIV patients: &quot;my family are unwilling to live with me&quot;, &quot;I'm rejected by my neighbors and community&quot;, &quot;my family members are rejected by relatives and neighbors&quot;, &quot;relatives and friends are afraid of me&quot;, and &quot;I suffer from verbal abuse&quot;. Item responses included: &quot;None of the time&quot; (score 0), &quot;a bit&quot; (score 1), &quot;moderate&quot; (score 2), &quot;severe&quot; (score 3), and &quot;very serious&quot; (score 4). A higher score indicates a higher level of perceived discrimination. The composite scale had a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.834.\nOutcomes\nAnxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were evaluated using Chinese versions of validated measurement tools. Specifically, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7; range, 0-21), and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; range, 0-27) were used to assess the severity of symptoms of anxiety and depression in the past two weeks. The 20-item PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; range, 0-80), was used to assess PTSD in the past month. The PCL-5 asks people to report on responses to a &quot;stressful&quot; experience and all participants in this study were asked to consider experiences with COVID-19 as the stressful experience, similar to other studies. Based on prior work, scores of 5 for both anxiety and depression were considered mild, whereas anxiety scores above 10 (moderate; 15 was severe) and depression scores of 10 (moderately severe; 20 indicated severe) were the cutoffs for clinically significant symptoms.\nSignificant PTSD related to COVID-19 was assumed to be present among participants who reported all of the following: at least one re-experiencing symptom, one avoidance symptom, two negative alterations in cognition or mood symptoms, and two arousal symptoms, where a symptom was considered present with a score of 2 (moderate) or higher. The reliabilities of GAD-7, PHQ-9 and PCL-5 were respectively 0.890, 0.875, 0.948.\nAnalysis strategy\nWe did analyses on three mental health outcomes: anxiety, depression, and PTSD related to COVID-19. At first, descriptive analysis of demographic variables, clinical features, perceived discrimination, anxiety, depression, and PTSD will be presented. Categorical variables are described as frequency rates and percentages and were compared for the study's outcomes by using Fisher's exact test. The continuous variables are described using median, range, and standard deviation values, and were compared with t-tests.\nNext, we tested the association between the predictor variables and presence of clinical outcomes using bivariate logistic regression analyses. The forward selection (likelihood ratio) method and stepwise method were respectively used to select the most significant variables from the 19 initial predicting variables. In the regression analysis, missing data were deleted listwise.\nResult\nDemographic profile of sample\n675 participants completed the survey, of whom 577 (85.5%) completed measures of perceived discrimination. The median age of the sample was 55(ICQ [41,66]). 358(53%) of the participants were female. 90 (13.3%) of the sample was medical staff (physicians and nurses). Only 77 (11.4%) of the participants were unmarried. 482 (63.4%) had a monthly income that was less than 5000 yuan (about 700 US dollars). 529 (78.4%) had an educational level below undergraduate. 140 (20.7%) of the participants lived with their parents and 338 (50.1%) lived with children.\nIllness and symptoms\nMost of the participants had been moderately ill with COVID-19 (406, 60.1%). Others were mildly (145, 21.5%), severely (116, 17.2%), or critically ill (8, 1.2%). 251 (37.2%) of the participants reported some chronic underlying disease. 35 (5.2%) of the patients had been in intensive care (ICU). 30 (4.4%) of the patients had re-detectable positive COVID-19 RNA test after hospital discharge. 96 (14.2%) of the participants had been given substantial doses of corticosteroid during hospital treatment. 13 (2.4%) of participants received invasive mechanical ventilation. 216 (32%) of the participants had at least one COVID symptom after discharge. Chest distress (99,14.7% of the full sample), cough (93, 13.8%) and fatigue (86,12.7%) were the most common symptoms after hospital discharge. 221 (32.7%) participants had at least one family member infected, and 47 (7%) had family members who had died because of COVID-19 infection.\nDescriptive analysis of mental health outcomes\nAbout 84 (12.4%) were provisionally diagnosed with clinically significant symptoms of PTSD due to COVID-19. The median score of PCL-5 was 12 (ICQ [4,16]). For anxiety, 70 (10.4%) were categorized as having moderate to severe symptoms, with another 218 (32.3%) reporting mild symptoms. 128 (19%) were categorized as having moderate to severe depression symptoms, with another 315 (46.7%) reporting mild symptoms. The median scores of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were respectively 4 (ICQ [2, 6]) and 5 (ICQ [3, 8]). Of note, there was significant overlap in symptoms; 41 (6.07%) had severe anxiety and clinically significant PTSD, 57 (8.44%) had clinically significant PTSD and depression, another 57 (8.44%) had both depression and anxiety symptoms, and 37 (5.48%) were categorized with all three.\nRisk factors of mental health outcomes\nCharacteristics of COVID-19 Patients and PTSD outcomes.\nTable 1	 	\n		Patients, No. (%)	 	Characteristic	All (n = 675)	No (n = 591)	PTSD (n = 84)	P value	 	Demographic Characteristics					 	Age, average	53.58	53.48	54.29	0.016	 	Female	358 (53.0)	314 (53.1)	44 (52.4)	0.908	 	Married	598(88.6(	520 (88.0)	78(92.9(	0.269	 	Undergraduate or above	146 (21.6)	128 (21.7)	18 (21.4)	1	 	Income above 5000$	193(28.6)	101(29.8)	17 (20.2)	0.072	 	Medical staff	90 (13.3)	79 (13.4)	11 (13.1)	0.553	 	Smoking	84(12.4)	72(12.2)	12(14.3)	0.596	 	Family situation					 	Live with parents	140(20.7)	118(20.0)	22 (26.2)	0.196	 	Live with children	338(50.1)	281(47.5(	57(67.9)	&lt;.001	 	Family member infected	221(32.7)	199 (33.7)	22 (26.2)	0.106	 	Family member died	47(7)	41 (6.9)	6 (7.1)	1	 	Clinical features in hospital					 	Underlying illness	251(37.2)	226(38.2)	25(29.8)	0.148	 	Severity levels					 	Mild	145 (21.5)	136 (23.0)	9 (10.7)	&lt;.001	 	Moderate	406 (60.1)	346 (58.5)	60 (71.4)		 	Severe	116 (17.2)	102 (17.3)	14 (16.7)		 	Critically ill	8 (1.2)	7 (1.2)	1 (1.2)		 	Days in hospital, average	27.87	28.05	26.62	0.004	 	Hospital treatment					 	Invasive mechanical ventilation	13(2.4)	12 (2.5)	1 (1.6)	1	 	Corticosteroids	96(20.8)	91(22.2)	5 (9.6)	0.016	 	ICU	35(5.2)	30 (5.1)	5 (6.0)	0.163	 	Signs and symptoms after discharge					 	Cough	93(13.8)	72 (12.2)	21 (25.0)	0.003	 	Chest pain	40(5.9)	35 (5.9)	5 (6.0)	1	 	Chest Distress	99(14.7)	76 (12.9)	23 (27.4)	&lt;.001	 	Dyspnea	36(5.3)	29 (4.9)	7 (8.3)	0.194	 	Dizziness	38(5.6)	30 (5.1)	8 (9.5)	0.123	 	Fatigue	86(12.7)	64(10.8)	22 (26.2)	&lt;.001	 	Other symptoms	49(7.3)	38 (6.4)	11 (13.1)	0.04	 	Re-detectable positive COVID-19 RNA test	30 (5.3)	26 (5.2)	4 (6.1)	0.769	 	Social factors					 	Discrimination, mean (S.D.)	7.67(2.94)	6.34 (2.56)	8.69 (2.81)	0.064	 	\nCharacteristics of COVID-19 Patients and anxiety outcomes.\nTable 2	 	\n		Patients, No. (%)	 	Characteristic	All (n = 675)	Mild/No (n = 605)	Moderate &amp;

Most COVID-19 symptoms after discharge were risk factors of depression and anxiety, but only cough, fatigue, and chest distress were significant for PTSD due to COVID-19 (p&lt;.05). Treatment by invasive mechanical ventilation and testing positive for COVID-19 RNA after discharge were not significant predictors of any of the three mental illness indicators (p&gt;.05). Treatment with corticosteroid was associated with lower risk of PTSD due to COVID-19 (p=.016) but higher risk of anxiety (p=.022). ICU was associated with higher level of depression (p = 0.003). Not surprisingly, severity of disease consistently acted as a main risk factor for PTSD due to COVID-19 (p&lt;.001), severe depression (p&lt;.001) and severe anxiety (p&lt;.001). Thus, the more severe the disease was, the worse the mental illness outcomes. Perceived discrimination was a strong risk factor for all 3 mental illness indicators (p&lt;.001).\nThe rates of developing heightened depression, anxiety and PTSD due to COVID-19 were the same among medical staff as among regular patients. Patients who lived with their own children had higher risk of PTSD due to COVID-19 (p&lt;.001), anxiety (p&lt;.001), and depression (p&lt;.001), as compared with patients who did not live with their children. Patients who had family members infected had higher risk of depression than other patients (p=.022 on the Fisher's exact test). Although death of a family member from COVID-19 was not significant for any test (p = 1, 0.808, and 0.440), it was significant in the multivariate analyses.\nFactors Associated with Mental Health Outcomes Identified by Multivariable Logistic Regression Analysis.\nTable 4	 	\nPTSD				 	variables	b coefficient (SE)	Odds ratio (95% CI for expected odds ratio)	p value	 	Live with children	1.9(0.45)	6.71[2.79, 16.12]	&lt;.001	 	Disease severity	1.19(0.34)	3.27[1.69, 6.32]	&lt;.001	 	Family member died	1.95(0.70)	7.05[1.78, 27.88]	0.005	 	Discrimination	0.52(0.06)	1.67[1.48, 1.90]	&lt;.001	 	Corticosteroids	-1.78(0.63)	0.17[0.05, 0.58]	0.005	 	\nModerate to Severe Depression			 	variables	b coefficient (SE)	Odds ratio (95% CI for expected odds ratio)	p value	 	Educational level	0.43(0.19)	1.54[1.07, 2.22]	0.021	 	Live with children	1.56(0.39)	4.75[2.20,10.23]	&lt;.001	 	Smoking	1.59(0.44)	4.89[2.05, 11.66]	&lt;.001	 	Disease severity	1.48(0.29)	4.40[2.51, 7.74]	&lt;.001	 	No of Symptoms	0.65(0.14)	1.92[1.47, 2.50]	&lt;.001	 	Discrimination	0.44(0.06)	1.55[1.37, 1.75]	&lt;.001	 	\nModerate to Severe Anxiety			 	variables	b coefficient (SE)	Odds ratio (95% CI for expected odds ratio)	p value	 	Live with children	2.08 (0.54)	8.01[2.79,23.04]	&lt;.001	 	Disease severity	1.07(0.32)	2.91[1.55, 5.48]	&lt;.001	 	Family member died	1.46(0.75)	4.29[0.99, 18.64]	0.052	 	No of Symptoms	0.39(0.13)	1.48[1.14,1.92]	0.003	 	Discrimination	0.36(0.06)	1.43[1.27,1.62]	&lt;.001	 	\nNote: Age, gender, marital status, educational level, income level, medical staff, smoking, live with parents, live with children, family member infected, family member died, underlying illness, severity COVID-19 disease levels, invasive mechanical ventilation, large dose corticosteroids use, ICU, No of Symptoms, re-detectable positive COVID-19 RNA test, perceived discrimination were entered into the model initially.\nWe selected the effective predictors using forward selection (likelihood ratio) method, see Table 4 .

I ., [1.48, 1.90]) were all risk factors for significant PTSD symptoms due to COVID-19. Corticosteroids use in treatment (OR, 0.17, 95% C. I., [.05, 0.58]) was associated with lower risk of PTSD.\nThe odds of reporting moderate to severe anxiety were significantly increased by each of the following factors: higher disease severity (OR, 2.91, 95% C. I ., [1.55,5.48]), living with children (OR, 8.01, 95% C. I ., [2.79,23.04]), death of family member from COVID (OR, 4.29, 95% C. I ., [0.99, 18.64]), higher total number of symptoms after discharge (OR, 1.48, 95% C. I ., [1.14, 1.92]), and perceiving self has having been target of discrimination (OR, 1.43, 95% C. I ., [1.27, 1.62]).\nThe odds of severe depression were significantly increased by each of the following: higher educational level (OR, 1.54, 95% C. I ., [1.07, 2.22]), living with children(OR, 4.75, 95% C. I ., [2.20, 10.23]), smoking (OR, 4.89, 95% C. I ., [2.05, 11.66]), higher disease severity (OR, 4.40, 95% C. I ., [2.51, 7.74]), higher total number of symptoms after discharge (OR, 1.92, 95% C. I ., [1.47,2.50]), and perceived discrimination (OR, 1.55, 95% C. I ., [1.37,1.75]).\nImportance score of predicting variables for moderate to severe depression.\nFig. 1\nImportance score of predicting variables for moderate to severe anxiety.\nFig. 2\nImportance score of predicting variables for PTSD.\nFig. 3\nRanking of importance scores allowed an ordering of the factors in terms of their efficiency to predict the outcome. With GUIDE random forest, we calculated the importance score to help us select the predictor variables most likely to influence the outcome. Perceived discrimination was always one of the most important variables in predicting anxiety, depression, or PTSD, see Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 .\nItem analyses\nItem analysis further indicated that sleep problems, intrusive thoughts, feeling distant or cut off from people, and inability to concentrate were the most prevalent symptoms of PTSD due to COVID-19. Our analyses of depression items also showed that sleep difficulty was the most frequently reported symptom.\nDiscussion\nOur survey indicates that there are substantial mental health problems among patients who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 and discharged. We had a large sample of 675 patients, and relatively few refused to do our survey, so the sample may be considered representative, at least for Chinese individuals.\nHalf of the sample reported at least mild symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety. Nevertheless, moderate to severe anxiety was reported by 10.4%, and moderate to severe depression was found among 19%. Importantly, these rates are significantly higher than anxiety and depression rates noted in studies of the general adult population in China (12 months generalized anxiety prevalence rates: 0.2%; major depression prevalence rates: 2.1%). Clearly, the adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19 do not end with discharge from the hospital, and many continue to report moderate to severe problems a month later.\nSignificant PTSD symptoms due to COVID-19 were considerably less common than depression, but 12.4% surpassed the cutoff for provisional PTSD diagnosis. The latter contrasts sharply with finding that 96% of patients currently hospitalized for COVID-19 had clinically significant symptoms of PTSD due to COVID-19. It seems reasonable to conclude that PTSD symptoms from COVID are quite high among hospitalized individuals, which may be due to the overlap between PTSD symptoms and acute illness (i.e., difficulties sleeping, feeling cut off from others, difficultly concentrating), and diminish substantially after discharge. Even so, clinically significant PTSD symptoms were still indicated a month after discharge in one out of eight respondents. Item analyses for PTSD and depression suggested that sleep difficulties were the most common symptoms, consistent with our personal interview findings with frontline nurses (exploratory interviews). suggest sleep problems may impair both emotions and attention regulation and cause irritability and concentration problems. Considering that a study of SARS survivors showed about 25% reported significant PTSD symptoms after 30 months, evaluation of long-term psychiatric outcomes is also warranted.\nGiven the wide variation in mental health outcomes, we sought to ascertain what predicted the more serious adverse outcomes. Not surprisingly, all three mental illness outcomes were more severe when the physical illness itself had been more severe : and also when more symptoms recurred after discharge. People who lived with their children were also more likely to have severe symptoms of mental illness, and those who experience the death of a family member were at greater risk for anxiety and PTSD symptoms. These findings suggest that post-COVID hospitalization, particularly for those with severe illness and with family stressors, should receive mental health resources directly after hospital discharge.\nOur findings do underscore the importance of social stigma and discrimination in exacerbating the emotional impact of COVID-19. Both the importance score analysis and multivariate logistic regression showed that perceived discrimination was associated with clinically significant PTSD symptoms, severe depression, and severe anxiety. Previous studies on SARS suggested that people avoid recovered patients due to fear of infection. Thus, fears of discrimination by others are likely founded for COVID-19 patients, and the sense of feeling isolated and &quot;othered&quot; seems to contribute to symptoms of mental illness. Considering that isolation is central to the quarantine process to diminish COVID-19 transmission, finding methods of helping quarantined patients remain connected to loved ones may be crucial to preventing mental health problems.\nHigh-dose corticosteroids were administered to many critically ill patients in Wuhan (Zhou et al., 2020) and were associated with higher mortality risk. Previous research on SARS patients found that high-dose corticosteroid use could lead to osteonecrosis of the femoral head (OFNH). Many patients worry about the sequelae of corticosteroid treatment and be more anxious. On the other hand, the use of corticosteroids in hospital treatment may be protective against PTSD symptoms (Zohar et al., 2011).\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, it is a cross-sectional study, which limits causal inference. Second, there may be a sample bias. It is possible that non-Chinese samples would have different patterns of mental illness associated with COVID-19. In addition, further work with a larger number of the most critically ill patients would be desirable. Third, our mental health outcomes were cut off based on the sum-score of diagnostic criteria, which may lead to Berkson's bias, presenting a potential threat to the validity our findings. Fourth, limited by the length of the questionnaire, we may have missed some important risk factors in our analysis such as waiting time for hospital admission. Fifth, we did not directly examine any medical comorbidities. Sixth, we do not have any assessment of mental health issues prior to COVID-19, and we are thus unable to ascertain if mental health symptoms were pre-existing, exacerbated or acutely caused by the stress of having COVID-19. This is a significant limitation, as we recognize that prior depression and anxiety are significant risk factors for symptom recurrence. However, because the rates of depression and anxiety in this study are higher than population levels, and because the PTSD symptoms addressed symptom responses to hospitalization with COVID, it is likely that heightened mental illness symptoms are related to the experience of having COVID-19.\nWe also recognize that mental illness may be associated with COVID-19 for people not directly infected by the virus, such as front line healthcare workers. In addition, lockdown and quarantine appears to be exacerbating interpersonal violence, as people are home more often and have fewer alternative outlets for emotional outbursts. Financial stressors associated with job losses due to COVID-19 related business shutdowns are also potential contributors to mental health issues, particularly in countries with less government protections Future work should examine mental health problems in these groups in addition to recovered patients.\nConclusions\nThe effects of COVID-19 extend beyond the (often quite serious) physical affliction. Almost half of the sample reported at least mild levels of depression and anxiety, and substantial minorities reported clinically significant symptoms PTSD and/or moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression. Some of these were linked to the severity of the physical illness and to recurring symptoms after discharge (as well as illness and death of family members), and at present there is no way to prevent those. However, we also found that feeling oneself to be the target of stigma and discrimination based on one's having COVID was strongly associated with all three negative outcomes. Some efforts toward public education to reduce stigma and discrimination may be warranted to reduce the secondary suffering associated with the pandemic.\nAuthors statement\nThis study is supported by fund for building world-class universities (disciplines) of .

residual symptoms, or using cognitive or mindfulness-based therapies for those with prior histories of recurrence.\n\n Future research that focuses on understanding causal pathways that link childhood

the occurrence of symptoms are still relatively unclear.\n This study investigated cognitive reactivity, i.\ne.\n the ease with which particular patterns of negative thinking are reactivated in response to mild low mood, as a potential mediator.\n Individuals with (N = 98) and without a previous history of depression (N = 83) who had provided neuroticism scores six years previously were assessed for cognitive reactivity and current symptoms of depression using self-report questionnaires.\n Tendencies to respond to mild low mood with ruminative thinking mediated the relation between neuroticism and current symptoms of depression in both groups.\n Reactivation of hopelessness and suicidal thinking occurred as an additional mediator only in those with a history of previous depression.\n The results suggest that neuroticism predisposes individuals to depression by generally increasing the likelihood of ruminative responses to low mood.\n In those with a history of depression in the past, neuroticism additionally increases risk of recurrence by facilitating reactivation of previously associated patterns such as suicidal thinking and hopelessness.\n These findings suggest potential targets for interventions to help preventing the occurrence, or recurrence of depression in those who due to their temperamental predisposition are at an increased

emotional regulation in the development of depression and physical illness.\n Literature suggests in fact that the employment of adaptive emotional regulation strategies (e.\ng.\n, reappraisal) causes a reduction of stress-elicited emotions leading to physical disorders.\n Conversely, dysfunctional emotional regulation strategies and, in particular, rumination and emotion suppression appear to be influential in the pathogenesis of depression and physiological disease.\n More specifically, the evidence suggests that depression and rumination affect both cognitive (e.\ng.\n, impaired ability to process negative information) and neurobiological mechanisms (e.\ng.\n, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis overactivation and higher rates of cortisol production).\n Understanding the factors that govern the variety of health outcomes that different people experience following exposure to stress has important implications for the development of effective emotion-regulation interventional

research based on the constructs of personality functioning (Criterion A) and maladaptive personality traits (Criterion B) as core components of personality pathology.\n However, little is known about the roles of these aspects in relation to borderline personality features during adolescence.\n The current study aimed at exploring the associations of Criterion A and B and their contribution in predicting borderline personality features in adolescence.\n A sample of 568 adolescents aged 11–17 (M = 14.38, SD = 1.57; 42.4% males) from different backgrounds (community-based, psychiatric inpatients, and youth forensic care) completed a set of questionnaires among which were measures of personality functioning, maladaptive personality traits, and borderline personality features.\n The findings reveal that Criterion A and B are strongly interrelated and both are significant in predicting borderline personality features in adolescents.\n Further, the results showed the incremental value of Criterion A beyond the level of underlying psychopathology and maladaptive personality traits suggesting the distinctive function of Criterion A to capture the features of borderline personality.\n These findings extend the knowledge about the dimensional aspects of personality pathology in adolescence.\n The implications in relation to the new personality disorder model in the

We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time.\n The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative.\n International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial.\n An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required.\n Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience.\n New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be

failure of COVID?19 patients","abstract":"Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS?CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS?CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS?CoV?2 (previously known as 2019?nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world.\n This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS?CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS?CoV and MERS?CoV.\n The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID?19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously.\n Additionally, some patients with COVID?19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases.\n The infection of SARS?CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected.\n Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse?connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung

the last.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the long-term psychiatric morbidities in survivors of SARS.\n\n\nMethod\nThis is a cohort study designed to investigate psychiatric complications among SARS survivors treated in the United Christian Hospital 30 months after the SARS outbreak.\n\n Psychiatric morbidities were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Impact of Events Scale–Revised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n\n Functional outcomes were assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey.\n\n\nResults\nNinety subjects were recruited, yielding a response rate of 96.8%.\n\n Post-SARS cumulative incidence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was 58.9%.\n\n Current prevalence for any psychiatric disorder at 30 months post-SARS was 33.3%.\n\n One-fourth of the patients had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 15.6% had depressive disorders.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe outbreak of SARS can be regarded as a mental health catastrophe.\n\n PTSD was the most prevalent long-term psychiatric condition, followed by depressive disorders.\n\n Our results highlight the need to enhance preparedness and competence of health care professionals in detecting and managing the psychological sequelae of future comparable infectious disease outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112501","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

violence (IPV) and its consequences is made complex by women’s diverse needs, priorities and contexts.\n\n Tailored online IPV interventions that account for differences among women have potential to reduce barriers to support and improve key outcomes.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Double blind randomized controlled trial of 462 Canadian adult women who experienced recent IPV randomly were assigned to receive either a tailored, interactive online safety and health intervention (iCAN Plan 4 Safety) or a static, non-tailored version of this tool.\n\n Primary (depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms) and secondary (helpfulness of safety actions, confidence in safety planning, mastery, social support, experiences of coercive control, and decisional conflict) outcomes were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12?months later via online surveys.\n\n Generalized Estimating Equations were used to test for differences in outcomes by study arm.\n\n Differential effects of the tailored intervention for 4 strata of women were examined using effect sizes.\n\n Exit survey process evaluation data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests and conventional content analysis.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Women in both tailored and non-tailored groups improved over time on primary outcomes of depression (p &lt;?.\n\n001) and PTSD (p &lt;?.\n\n001) and on all secondary outcomes.\n\n Changes over time did not differ by study arm.\n\n Women in both groups reported high levels of benefit, safety and accessibility of the online interventions, with low risk of harm, although those completing the tailored intervention were more positive about fit and helpfulness.\n\n Importantly, the tailored intervention had greater positive effects for 4 groups of women, those: with children under 18 living at home; reporting more severe violence; living in medium-sized and large urban centers; and not living with a partner.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>This trial extends evidence about the effectiveness of online safety and health interventions for women experiencing IPV to Canadian women and provides a contextualized understanding about intervention processes and effects useful for future refinement and scale up.\n\n The differential effects of the tailored intervention found for specific subgroups support the importance of attending to diverse contexts and needs.\n\n iCAN is a promising intervention that can complement resources available to Canadian women experiencing IPV.\n\n\nTrial registration\nid='Par5'>Clinicaltrials.\n\ngov ID NCT02258841

Associations With Behavioral Health Outcomes","abstract":"Bullying and sibling aggression can appear as similar behavior, though the latter is comparatively understudied.\n Aligned with the Theory of Intergenerational Transmission of Violence, research suggests that exposure to family violence increases an individual's risk for perpetrating violence in their own future relationships.\n Additionally, Problem Behavior Theory suggests that engaging in one problem behavior (e.\ng.\n, bullying) increases the likelihood of engaging in other problem behavior (e.\ng.\n, substance use).\n In Phase 1, this study of middle school students from the U.\nS.\n examined how exposure to family violence predicted membership in latent classes of bullying and sibling aggression perpetration (N = 894, sampled from four middle schools).\n In Phase 2, we used mixture modeling to understand how latent classes of family violence, sibling aggression, and bullying predict future substance use, mental health outcomes, and deviance behavior later in high school.\n Results yielded four profiles of peer and sibling aggression: high all, high sibling aggression, high peer aggression, and low all aggression.\n Youth who reported witnessing more family violence at home were significantly more likely to fall into the sibling aggression only and high all classes, compared to the low all class.\n Phase 2 results also yielded four classes: a high all class, a sibling aggression and family violence class, a peer aggression class, and a low all class.\n Individuals in the high all class were more likely to experience several unfavorable outcomes (substance use, depression, delinquency) compared to other classes.\n This study provides evidence for pathways from witnessing violence, to perpetrating aggression across multiple contexts, to developing other deleterious mental and behavioral health outcomes.\n These findings highlight the negative impact family violence can have on child development, providing support for a cross-contextual approach for programming aimed at developing relationships skills.\n","id":"PMC7027165","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Katherine

course of anxiety disorders","abstract":"Background\nAmong the psychological difficulties seen in children of parents with substance use problems, the anxiety disorders are among the most chronic conditions.\n\n Although children of alcoholic parents often struggle with the effects of parental substance use problems long into adulthood, empirical investigations of the influence of parental substance use disorders on the course of anxiety disorders in adult offspring are rare.\n\n The purpose of this study was to examine prospectively the relationship between parental substance use disorders and the course of anxiety disorders in adulthood over the course of 12 years.\n\n\nMethods\nData on 618 subjects were derived from the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Project (HARP), a longitudinal naturalistic investigation of the clinical course of multiple anxiety disorders.\n\n Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to calculate probabilities of time to anxiety disorder remission and relapse.\n\n Proportional hazards regressions were conducted to determine whether the likelihood of remission and relapse for specific anxiety disorders was lower for those who had a history of parental substance use disorders than for individuals without this parental history.\n\n\nResults\nAdults with a history of parental substance use disorders were significantly more likely to be divorced and to have a high school level of education.\n\n History of parental substance use disorder was a significant predictor of relapse of social phobia and panic disorders.\n\n\nConclusion\nThese findings provide compelling evidence that adult children of parents with substance use disorders are more likely to have relapses of social phobia and panic disorders.\n\n Clinicians who treat adults with anxiety disorders should assess parental substance use disorders and dependence histories.\n\n Such information may facilitate treatment planning with regards to their patients' level of vulnerability to perceive scrutiny by others in social situations, and ability to maintain a long-term panic-free state.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1866228","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria

epidemiology of social anxiety disorder: Data from the World Mental Health Survey Initiative","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>There is evidence that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder.\n\n However, most of the available data on the epidemiology of this condition originate from high income countries in the West.\n\n The World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative provides an opportunity to investigate the prevalence, course, impairment, socio-demographic correlates, comorbidity, and treatment of this condition across a range of high, middle, and low income countries in different geographic regions of the world, and to address the question of whether differences in SAD merely reflect differences in threshold for diagnosis.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Data from 28 community surveys in the WMH Survey Initiative, with 142,405 respondents, were analyzed.\n\n We assessed the 30-day, 12-month, and lifetime prevalence of SAD, age of onset, and severity of role impairment associated with SAD, across countries.\n\n In addition, we investigated socio-demographic correlates of SAD, comorbidity of SAD with other mental disorders, and treatment of SAD in the combined sample.\n\n Cross-tabulations were used to calculate prevalence, impairment, comorbidity, and treatment.\n\n Survival analysis was used to estimate age of onset, and logistic regression and survival analyses were used to examine socio-demographic correlates.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>SAD 30-day, 12-month, and lifetime prevalence estimates are 1.3, 2.4, and 4.0% across all countries.\n\n SAD prevalence rates are lowest in low/lower-middle income countries and in the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions, and highest in high income countries and in the Americas and the Western Pacific regions.\n\n Age of onset is early across the globe, and persistence is highest in upper-middle income countries, Africa, and the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\n There are some differences in domains of severe role impairment by country income level and geographic region, but there are no significant differences across different income level and geographic region in the proportion of respondents with any severe role impairment.\n\n Also, across countries SAD is associated with specific socio-demographic features (younger age, female gender, unmarried status, lower education, and lower income) and with similar patterns of comorbidity.\n\n Treatment rates for those with any impairment are lowest in low/lower-middle income countries and highest in high income countries.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>While differences in SAD prevalence across countries are apparent, we found a number of consistent patterns across the globe, including early age of onset, persistence, impairment in multiple domains, as well as characteristic socio-demographic correlates and associated psychiatric comorbidities.\n\n In addition, while there are some differences in the patterns of impairment associated with SAD across the globe, key similarities suggest that the threshold for diagnosis is similar regardless of country income levels or geographic location.\n\n Taken together, these cross-national data emphasize the international clinical and public health significance of SAD.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5535284","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

Evidence suggests that individuals previously exposed to traumatic events, and particularly to continuous traumatic stress (CTS), might be more vulnerable to distress when facing additional stressors. This study aimed to investigate these suppositions in the context of the ongoing shelling of Israel from the Israel-Gaza border, which continues even amidst the COVID-19 crisis.\nMethod\nAn online survey was conducted among Israel's general population. The sample included 976 participants. Seven-hundred-and-ninety-three participants had been exposed to traumatic events, with 255 participants reporting CTS. Trauma exposure, COVID-19-related stressors, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 (anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms) were assessed.\nResults\nMost participants reported experiencing at least one psychiatric symptom related to COVID-19. Being younger, female, not in a relationship, having a below-average income, being diagnosed with the disease, living alone during the outbreak, having a close other in a high-risk group, and negatively self-rating one's health status were associated with elevated distress. Individuals who had been exposed to trauma, and to CTS in particular, had elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms compared to individuals without such a history or to survivors of non-ongoing traumatic events. CTS moderated the relations between PTSD symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, with significantly stronger relations found among individuals exposed to CTS.\nLimitations\nThis study relied on convenience sampling.\nConclusions\nTrauma survivors, and particularly traumatized individuals exposed to CTS, seem at risk for psychological distress related to COVID-19.\n1. Introduction\nIn December 2019, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan, China. Early stages of COVID-19 include severe acute respiratory infection, with some patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory failure, and other severe complications. This disease is highly infectious, and after it was identified in Wuhan, it was identified in other parts of the world. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a &quot;Public Health Emergency of International Concern&quot;.\nIn February 2020, the virus was identified in Israel, and by April 19th, the number of individuals diagnosed with the virus was 13,107, with 158 people deceased. To slow down the spread of this highly contagious and potentially fatal virus, strict measures were taken in Israel, including restricting outdoor activities, cancelling gatherings, closing schools and institutes of higher learning, shutting down all &quot;non-essential&quot; businesses, minimizing public transportation, etc.\nThe outbreak itself and the measures taken to bring it under control have likely been highly stressful for many individuals. As such, it is reasonable to suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic will have implications not only for physical health, but also for mental health and well-being. Furthermore, as with the SARS outbreak, it would not be surprising to find that the COVID-19 pandemic has been experienced by many as a traumatic event, leading to trauma-related symptoms, namely peritraumatic stress reactions.\nAlthough research exploring psychological distress related to COVID-19 is only in its initial stages, recent studies have provided support for this view. A recent cross-sectional study of 1257 healthcare workers in hospitals equipped with clinics/wards for patients with COVID-19 in China found that a considerable proportion of these workers reported experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. A longitudinal study conducted among the general population in China during the initial outbreak of COVID-19, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, indicated clinically significant peritraumatic stress symptoms as well as moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety, and depression, which did not change significantly over time. A study among 6049 Chinese individuals ranging from 17 to 63 years of age uncovered three profiles of peritraumatic stress symptoms: mild (80.9%), moderate (13.0%), and high (6.1%). Lastly, a nationwide large-scale survey of psychological distress in the general population of China indicated that almost 35% of respondents experienced psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe severity of an individual's psychological distress in response to COVID-19 may be related to specific COVID-19-related stressors. Being diagnosed with COVID-19, belonging to a risk group for COVID-19 complications, and perceiving one's physical health in a negative fashion may all raise substantial concerns during the pandemic and might intensify one's emotional plight (e.g.,). Having family members or close others who belong to a risk group for COVID-19 might also increase worries and generate or exacerbate psychological distress. Lastly, being quarantined or living alone during the pandemic might also have detrimental effects. Reduced social interactions and loneliness are well-known risk factors for psychopathology and might increase individuals' vulnerability, particularly under conditions of exposure to stressors. Indeed, a recent review which included 24 studies, found posttraumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger among quarantined children and adults.\nThat said, there are some individuals who might be even more vulnerable than others to the implications of the COVID-19 crisis. According to the ''sensitization'' hypothesis, individuals who have previously been exposed to traumatic events might react more severely to additional stressors due to heightened sensitivity to stress or depleted coping capacities. Research has supported this claim. A meta-analysis that was based on 68 studies indicated that previous exposure to a traumatic event was related to an elevated risk for PTSD following a later trauma. This association seems to be applicable when the additional stressor is a physical illness; for example, previous exposure to a traumatic event was found to be associated with psychiatric symptomatology, depression, and PTSD symptoms in women with breast cancer. This heightened vulnerability of individuals previously exposed to trauma might be rooted in posttraumatic distress subsequent to trauma exposure. During its follow-up periods, a longitudinal study revealed that traumatized individuals with PTSD were at a higher risk for PTSD than were individuals with no history of trauma exposure.\nDespite the evidence regarding the effects of prior trauma and posttraumatic distress on the distress of individuals who are facing an additional stressor, to the best of my knowledge no study to date has explored this subject with regard to a worldwide pandemic such as COVID-19. Furthermore, to date the research has been focused on the effects of additional stressors on survivors of past traumatic events (i.e., events that came to an end), and not on survivors of continuous traumatic stress.\nContinuous traumatic stress (CTS) or Type III trauma exposure reflects a situation in which individuals repeatedly face an ongoing and protracted threat, typically lasting several years. Continuous traumatic stress is a common phenomenon worldwide, and can result from various traumatic situations, such as living under conditions of constant urban violence, or being exposed to continuous rocket shellings, the latter of which was the focus of the current study.\nLiving under conditions of ongoing exposure to traumatic events involves constant uncertainty, as well as constant alertness and preparedness. Recurrent exposure to traumatic stress impairs people's ability to maintain a stable routine and creates a sense of threat, vulnerability, anxiety, confusion, uncertainty, and helplessness. Research has indeed documented elevated distress among individuals exposed to CTS situations, including PTSD symptomatology, anxiety, depression, and helplessness, as well as somatization.\nThe ramifications of ongoing and unceasing exposure to trauma might not be limited to CTS-related psychological distress; rather, CTS may very well affect one's ability to adjust to new challenges and stressors, such as the COVID-19 threat. Given that CTS demands an ongoing effort to cope, individuals in CTS situations might be worn down and depleted of coping capacities, and thus particularly vulnerable to COVID-19-related stressors. Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that suffering from posttraumatic distress would be particularly difficult and painful when one continues to be exposed to the trauma, with such continuous exposure heightening one's vulnerability in the context of new challenges. Thus, the negative effects of PTSD symptoms on psychological distress related to COVID-19 might be particularly prominent among individuals exposed to CTS, and more so than among individuals who were exposed to traumatic events that came to an end.\n2. The current study\nSadly, the situation in southern Israel today allows us to examine the aforementioned postulations. For the past almost two decades, as part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, individuals living in this region have been subjected to frequent rocket shelling from the Gaza side of the border, with more than 17,000 rockets and mortars fired. Although there have been some relatively quiet periods, there have also been several intensive armed conflicts, each interspersed with varying amounts of shelling, right before and during the conflicts. These attacks have resulted in death, injury, damage, and disruption to the everyday life of Israelis living in the &quot;Gaza envelope.&quot; These attacks have continued, even now, at a time when Israelis are also contending with the COVID-19 disaster.\nTo describe the prevalence of COVID-19-related stressors as well as the levels of psychological distress (peritraumatic stress symptoms, anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms) related to COVID-19.\nTo explore the contribution of trauma exposure in explaining psychological distress related to COVID-19, above and beyond demographic characteristics and COVID-19-related stressors.\nTo explore the moderating role of trauma type (CTS versus past trauma exposure) in the associations between PTSD symptoms and psychological distress related to COVID-19, above and beyond demographic characteristics and COVID-19-related stressors.\nThe present study aimed to explore whether individuals previously exposed to traumatic events, and particularly those previously and currently exposed to CTS as part of their living in the &quot;Gaza envelope,&quot; suffer from increased vulnerability when facing COVID-19. Specifically, the current investigation strove to explore the contribution of PTSD symptoms as a result of past trauma exposure versus as a result of CTS in explaining psychological distress (peritraumatic stress symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms) in the face of COVID-19. Being the first, presumably, to address this subject matter, the current study was exploratory in nature. Three main objectives were set: \n3. Methods\n3.1. Participants and procedure\nAn online survey was conducted among a convenience sample of Israeli adults. The survey was accessible through Qualtrics, a secure web-based survey data collection system. The survey took an average of 25 min to complete and was open from April 2, 2020 to April 19, 2020. It was anonymous, and no data were collected that linked participants to recruitment sources. The Tel Aviv University institutional review board (IRB) approved all procedures and instruments. Clicking on the link to the survey guided potential respondents to a page that provided information about the purpose of the study, the nature of the questions, and a consent form (i.e., the survey was voluntary; respondents could quit at any time; responses would be anonymous). The first page also offered researcher contact information. Each participant was given the opportunity to take part in a lottery that included four $60 gift vouchers.\nA total of 1263 people participated in the survey. Of them, only 976 (77.3%) participants who provided data regarding the study variables were included. No differences were found between participants who were included in the study and those who were not in terms of relationship status, education, or income (P s &gt; 0.05). Yet there were significant differences between the groups in terms of age, t(1261)= -2.07, p = .04; gender, chi2(1, n = 1263) = 4.94, p = .03; and religiosity, chi2(1, n = 1263) = 4.08, p = .04. The average age among the current sample was higher (M = 44.37, SD = 14.28) than among the group of participants who were not included in the study (M = 42.37, SD = 14.78), and the proportion of women and secular individuals among the current sample was higher (81.6%, 69.4%, respectively) than among the group of participants who were not included in the study (75.6%, 62.9%, respectively).\nParticipants' ages ranged from 18 to 79 (M = 44.37, SD = 14.28), with the majority of the sample being below the age of 50 (61.6%). Most of the participants were Jewish (96.4%) women (81.6%); were secular (69.4%); had a high school degree or under (52.2%); were in a relationship (64.7%); and had an average or above-average income (50.3%).\nOf the total sample, 793 participants (81.3%) were classified as having been exposed to traumatic events based on the Trauma History Screen (THS). The average age of this subgroup was 45.54 (SD = 14.12). Most of this sub-group were women (81.3%); were secular (69.3%); had a high school degree or under (53.5%); and had an above-average income (50.1%).\nRegarding type of traumatic event, 255 participants (31.5%) reported continuous exposure to rocket attacks (thus, CTS), and the rest of the 543 participants reported exposure to a traumatic event that had ended. The latter category (i.e., a traumatic event that had ended) included accidents (24.1%), a physical or sexual assault during childhood (26.9%), natural disasters (2.5%), a physical or sexual assault in adulthood (20.7%), being attacked with a gun, knife, or weapon (6.6%), the sudden death of a family member or close friend (69.1%), seeing someone die or get badly hurt or killed (20.8%), and seeing something horrible during military service (17.0%). The vast majority of participants reported two traumatic events or more (66.2%).\n3.2. Measures\n3.2.1. Background variables\nParticipants completed a brief demographic questionnaire that assessed age, gender, education, relational status, religiosity, and income.\n3.2.2. COVID-19-related stressors\nSpecific stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic were measured via nine items designed by the research team. Participants were asked (1) how they perceived their own physical health, (2) whether they were diagnosed with the disease, (3) whether they were quarantined, (4) whether they were living alone during the outbreak, (5) whether they belonged to a high-risk group for COVID-19, (6) whether they had close others who belonged to a high-risk group, (7) whether they had close others who had been diagnosed with the disease, (8) whether they had close others who had been hospitalized due to the disease, and (9) whether they had experienced the loss of close others as a result of the disease. Given that only four participants reported experiencing the last three stressors (having close others who were diagnosed with the disease, having close others who were hospitalized due to the disease, experiencing a loss of close others due to the disease), these specific stressors were not included in the present analyses.\n3.2.3. Anxiety and depression symptoms related to COVID-19\nLevels of anxiety and depression symptoms in response to COVID-19 were assessed by the anxiety and depression subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18). The BSI-18 is a self-report symptom checklist measure consisting of 18 items, each describing a psychiatric symptom. Anxiety and depression subscales consist of six items each. Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they had been bothered by the symptom in the prior week, on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Mean scores on each subscale reflect the respondent's level of anxiety or depression symptoms, with higher scores reflecting greater symptoms. The raw scores are converted to T scores, with an accepted cutoff point of 63 for psychopathology on depression and anxiety subscales. The BSI-18 has been found to have adequate convergent and discriminant validity and good reliability. Internal consistency reliabilities in this study were good for both the depression (alpha = 0.86) and anxiety subscale (alpha = 0.89).\n3.2.4. Peritraumatic stress symptoms related to COVID-19\nPeritraumatic stress symptoms in response to COVID-19 were measured via a modified version of the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5). This 20-item self-report measure asks participants to indicate the extent to which they experienced each PTSD symptom, on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Items correspond to the newly approved PTSD symptom criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed., DSM-5). The original version was adapted so that the timeframe for experiencing each symptom was changed from &quot;in the past month&quot; to &quot;since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,&quot; and the index event was the COVID-19 pandemic. A total score of peritraumatic stress symptoms was calculated by summing all 20 items. Although not a definitive diagnostic measure, preliminary research suggests a cutoff score of 33 is a useful threshold to indicate symptomatology which may be at clinical levels. The PCL-5 demonstrates high internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Internal consistency reliabilities in this study for the PCL-5 total score was excellent (alpha = 0.94).\n3.2.5. Trauma exposure\nExposure to traumatic events was measured via a modified version of the Trauma History Screen (THS; Carlson et al., 2011). The THS was developed as a brief, easy-to-complete self-report measure of exposure to high-magnitude stressor events that could be traumatic. Only 11 items (of the original 15 items) which reflect traumatic events according to the DSM-5 criteria were included. In addition, &quot;continuous exposure to rocket attacks&quot; was added to the list of events. For each event, respondents are asked to indicate whether the event occurred (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;).\n3.2.6. PTSD symptoms as a result of trauma exposure\nPTSD symptoms were measured via the PCL-5. Participants were asked to anchor responses to &quot;stressful life experiences&quot; on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). A total score is also calculated to assess the overall PTSD severity. Internal consistency reliability in this study for the PCL-5 total score subscales was excellent (alpha = 0.95).\n3.3. Analytic strategy\nThe current analyses were conducted using SPSS 25 and PROCESS computational macro. To assess the univariate associations between background characteristics and COVID-19-related stressors, on the one hand, and psychological distress outcomes (i.e., anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and peritraumatic stress symptoms) on the other, linear regressions were conducted.\nTo explore the unique contribution of trauma exposure in explaining psychological distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic above and beyond background characteristics and COVID-19-related stressors, three multiple regression analyses were conducted. Anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and peritraumatic stress symptoms were treated as dependent variables. Trauma exposure, COVID-19-related stressors, and the background variables of age, gender, relationship status, and income - all four of which variables had the largest contribution in explaining psychological distress outcomes compared to the other background variables - were treated as independent variables.\nTo explore the moderating role of trauma type (CTS versus previous non-ongoing trauma exposure) in the associations between PTSD symptoms and psychological distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, moderation analyses were conducted via PROCESS (Model 1) computational macro. These analyses were conducted only among participants who reported a trauma history and had data regarding PTSD symptoms (n = 543, 68.5%). Scores of all the variables were standardized. Significant interactions were probed using the PROCESS (Model 1) computational macro.\nTo determine whether including the independent variable and covariates in the current analyses was adequate, we assessed for multicollinearity, and examined the variance inflation factors (VIFs) for the study variables. Findings indicated that all were within the acceptable range (all VIFs were smaller than 2), indicating that multicollinearity was not a problem in our analyses.\n4. Results\n4.1. COVID-19-related stressors\nRespondents reported several COVID-19-related stressors. These consisted of being diagnosed with the disease (n = 5, 0.5%), being quarantined (n = 93, 9.5%), living alone during the outbreak (n = 144, 14.8%), belonging to a high-risk group for COVID-19 (n = 320, 33.6%), perceiving one's physical health in a negative fashion (n = 69, 7.0%), having a close other who was diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 67, 6.9%), and having a close other who belonged to a high-risk group (n = 817, 83.7%).\n4.2. Psychological distress related to COVID-19\nThe majority of the sample (n = 824, 84.4%) reported experiencing at least one anxiety symptom since the outbreak of the pandemic, and the average of the levels of anxiety symptoms was 0.92 (+-.84). Moreover, 101 (10.3%) participants met the anxiety criteria. Similarly, the majority of the sample (n = 838, 85.9%) reported experiencing at least one depression symptom since the outbreak of the pandemic. The average of the levels of depression symptoms was 0.85 (+-.77), and 99 (10.1%) participants met the depression criteria. Among participants who suffered from clinically significant anxiety symptoms since the outbreak of the pandemic, 86.1% had a history of exposure to prior trauma; among participants who suffered from clinically significant depression symptoms since the pandemic's outbreak, 88.9% had a history of exposure to prior trauma.\nThe vast majority of the sample (n = 749, 76.7%) reported experiencing at least one peritraumatic stress symptom specifically related to COVID-19, and the average of the levels of peritraumatic stress symptoms was 15.39 (+-.13.28). Furthermore, 11.5% (n = 112) of the participants had a peritraumatic stress symptom total score of 33 and above, indicating that their symptoms were clinically significant. Among participants who suffered from clinically significant peritraumatic stress symptoms in relation to COVID-19, 90.2% had a history of exposure to prior trauma.\n4.3.

As can be seen in the table, age, gender, relationship status, and income were related to all outcomes. Being younger was associated with higher anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms related to the pandemic. It should be noted that the current study's exploration of psychological distress among the different age groups (18-29, 30-39, 40-59, 60-79) corroborated the existence of this trend, indicating higher distress among younger people. Being female, not being in a relationship, and having a below-average income were also associated with higher anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms related to COVID-19. Having a high school degree or below was related to elevated peritraumatic stress symptoms only, and religiosity was unrelated to any of the psychological distress outcomes.\nCOVID-19-related stressors were associated with psychological distress as well. Negative perceived health was related to elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms. Being diagnosed with the disease was related to elevated anxiety and peritraumatic stress symptoms, and living alone during the outbreak was related to elevated depression and anxiety symptoms. Being quarantined and belonging to a high-risk group for COVID-19 were both related to elevated peritraumatic stress symptoms. Lastly, having a close other who belonged to a high-risk group was associated with elevated anxiety and depression symptoms.\n4.4.

Results of the analyses are presented in Table 2 . As can be seen in the table, younger age, being female, and having a lower-than-average income were related to elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms during the pandemic. Not having a relationship was related to elevated depression symptoms. Being diagnosed with COVID-19 was related to increased anxiety symptoms, and living alone during the outbreak was associated with elevated depression symptoms. Negative perceived health was associated with elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms. More importantly, a history of exposure to a traumatic event had a significant effect in explaining anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, above and beyond the other variables in the model, so that individuals who were classified as having been exposed to traumatic events had higher levels of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic than did individuals who had not previously been exposed to traumatic events.\n4.5. Psychological distress when facing COVID-19 and PTSD symptoms subsequent to prior trauma\nOf the 793 participants who were classified as having been exposed to traumatic events, only 543 participants (68.5%) provided data regarding PTSD symptoms subsequent to these events. Of them, 243 participants (44.8%) reported continuous exposure to rocket attacks, whereas the rest (n = 300, 55.2%) reported exposure to traumatic events that had ended. The average of the levels of PTSD symptoms subsequent to prior trauma was 12.43 (+-.14.01), and 9.9% (n = 54) of the participants had a PTSD symptom score of 33 and above, indicating that their symptoms were clinically significant.\nExploring psychological distress among this subgroup indicated that 12.2% (n = 66) suffered from either clinically significant anxiety or depression symptoms since the outbreak of the pandemic, and 13.3% (n = 72) suffered from clinically significant peritraumatic stress symptoms in relation to COVID-19. Among participants who had clinically significant anxiety or depression symptoms since the outbreak of the pandemic, 39.4% and 45.5% (respectively) had PTSD symptoms at a clinical level subsequent to prior trauma. Supplementary logistic analyses indicated that the risk for clinically significant anxiety or depression symptoms since the outbreak of the pandemic was more than 10 or 15 times higher, respectively, among participants with clinically significant PTSD symptoms subsequent to prior trauma than among participants with PTSD symptoms below a clinical level (odds ratio = 10.42, 95% confidence interval: 5.58 -19.46; odds ratio = 15.73, 95% confidence interval: 8.84 -29.68, respectively).\nAmong participants who had clinically significant peritraumatic stress symptoms in relation to COVID-19, 41.7% had clinically significant PTSD symptoms subsequent to prior trauma. The proportion of clinically significant peritraumatic stress symptoms in relation to COVID-19 was higher among participants who had PTSD symptoms at a clinical level subsequent to prior trauma than among participants with PTSD symptoms below a clinical level (55.6% vs. 8.6%). A supplementary logistic analysis indicated that the risk for clinically significant peritraumatic stress symptoms in relation to COVID-19 was more than 13 times higher among participants with clinically significant PTSD symptoms subsequent to prior trauma than among participants with PTSD symptoms below a clinical level (odds ratio = 13.30, 95% confidence interval: 7.13 -24.80).\n4.6. Psychological distress when facing COVID-19 and PTSD symptoms: the moderating role of trauma type\nThe moderating role of trauma type in the relations between PTSD symptoms and COVID-19-related psychological distress among trauma survivors (n = 543).\nTable 3	 	\n	Anxiety symptoms	Depression symptoms	Peritraumatic stress symptoms	 	beta	R2	beta	R2	beta	R2	 	Age	-0.22***	.42	-0.25***	.43	-0.16***	.42	 	Gender	.11**		.06		-0.06		 	Relationship status	.01		-0.10*		-0.01		 	Income	-0.03		-0.06		-0.05		 	COVID-19 diagnosis	.06		.02		.04		 	In quarantine	.00		.05		.04		 	Belong to risk group	.01		-0.06		.03		 	Perceived health	-0.09*		-0.14***		-0.09*		 	Living alone during outbreak	.04		.07*		.01		 	Close other in risk group	.02		.04		.00		 	Trauma type	.13***		.47***		.11***		 	PTSD symptoms	.52***		.10**		.51***		 	Trauma type X PTSD symptoms	.10**		.04		.11**		 	\n*p &lt; .05, **p &lt; .01, ***p &lt; .001.\nTo explore the moderating role of trauma type in the relations between PTSD symptoms and psychological distress during the pandemic, moderation analyses were conducted among this group of participants (n = 543). Results of the moderation analyses are presented in Table 3 . As can be seen in the table, younger age was associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms. Being female was associated with elevated anxiety symptoms, and not having a relationship was associated with elevated depression symptoms. Negative perceived health was associated with elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, and living alone during the outbreak was associated with elevated depression symptoms. Trauma type and PTSD symptoms had a significant effect in explaining anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms. Individuals exposed to CTS had more elevated psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic than did individuals exposed to traumatic stress that had ended. Additionally, higher levels of PTSD symptoms subsequent to trauma exposure were related to elevated psychological distress manifested in anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe moderating role of trauma type in the associations between PTSD symptoms and COVID 19 related anxiety symptoms controlling for demographic characteristics and COVID-19-related stressors.\nFig. 1\nThe moderating role of trauma type in the associations between PTSD symptoms and COVID 19 related peritraumatic stress symptoms controlling for demographic characteristics and COVID-19-related stressors.\nFig. 2\nFurthermore, trauma type significantly moderated the relations between PTSD symptoms on the one hand, and anxiety and peritraumatic stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic on the other. Probing these interactions revealed a similar trend which is depicted in Figs. 1 and 2: Although PTSD symptoms subsequent to trauma exposure had a significant effect in explaining anxiety and peritraumatic stress symptoms during the pandemic among participants exposed to CTS as well as participants exposed to traumatic events that had ended, this effect was significantly stronger among participants exposed to CTS (beta = 0.69, p &lt; .001; 0.70, p &lt; .001, respectively) than among participants exposed to traumatic events that had ended (beta = 0.47, p &lt; .001; 0.44, p &lt; .001, respectively).\n5. Discussion\nThis study described the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the mental health of Israel's general population. The study's results indicated that the majority of the sample reported experiencing at least one symptom of anxiety, depression, or peritraumatic stress. Furthermore, around one tenth of the sample had peritraumatic stress symptoms above the cutoff of 33, and another 10% of the sample met the criteria for anxiety or depression. These findings demonstrate the potential negative implications of COVID-19 for mental health and are in line with recent studies that were conducted in China revealing anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms among general population samples as a result of COVID-19.\nSeveral demographic characteristics were associated with elevated distress. Consistent with a previous study, the present results indicated that female participants had a higher degree of psychological distress related to COVID-19 than did male participants. This finding coincides with previous studies that found women to be at an elevated risk for depression and anxiety, findings which might be rooted in biological and socioeconomic factors. The lack of being in a relationship and having a below-average income were also associated with intensified distress. In terms of explaining these associations, the lack of being in a relationship might have limited social support and exacerbated loneliness, particularly under the current circumstances of social distancing, and having a below-average income might have increased financial worries and concerns stemming from the COVID-19 crisis, and potentially exacerbating distress. The current results, indicating a relation between younger age and elevated distress, are also consistent with a previous study that found respondents aged 12-21.4 years to suffer from a higher psychological impact of COVID-19 than did older respondents. This finding suggests that although people in the 65+ age group are actually the ones most at risk of suffering from COVID-19 complications, they might not be particularly susceptible to potential psychopathology. Young adults, on the other hand, showed elevated vulnerability, which may have been rooted in obtaining a large amount of information via social media.\nExploring the univariate relations between COVID-19-related stressors and the psychological distress connected with the pandemic revealed significant associations between all of the stressors and psychological distress outcomes. Nevertheless, when demographic characteristics and trauma exposure were also included in the analyses, only four stressors had a significant effect in explaining the levels of psychological distress. Specifically, being diagnosed with the disease, living alone during the outbreak, having a close other who belonged to a high-risk group, and negatively self-rating one's health status - all of which have been documented in previous studies (e.g.,) - were found to significantly explain the levels of psychological distress. Whereas negatively self-rating one's health status was related to all psychological distress outcomes, the other three COVID-19-related stressors were associated with specific types of symptomatology. Namely, being diagnosed with the disease and having a close other who belonged to a high-risk group, which could intensify tension and worries, were related to anxiety symptoms. Living alone during the outbreak, a condition that could deepen feelings of loneliness, was linked to elevated depression.\nThe importance of this study, however, lies in its discovery of the effects of previous trauma exposure in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The present findings indicated that individuals who had previously been exposed to traumatic events had elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms as related to COVID-19, compared to individuals who had not previously been exposed to traumatic events, even after taking into account demographic characteristics and COVID-19-related stressors. Furthermore, PTSD symptoms subsequent to prior trauma were associated with elevated symptomatology in the face of the pandemic.\nThese findings suggest that prior trauma exposure and subsequent posttraumatic reactions might intensify one's vulnerability when facing a substantial additional stressor, such as the COVID-19 threat. Prior trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD might lead to physiological alterations that could increase one's vulnerability in the face of an additional stressor. Additionally, depletion of coping capacities and resources following trauma exposure might increase negative reactions in the face of COVID-19, eventuating in elevated distress and psychopathology.\nGoing a step further, the present study demonstrated that the impact of trauma exposure on the psychological distress connected with COVID-19 depended upon the nature of the exposure. In comparison to exposure to traumatic events that had ended, exposure to CTS was related to elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms. Furthermore, exposure to CTS moderated the relations between PTSD symptoms on the one hand, and anxiety and peritraumatic stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, on the other. Although PTSD symptoms had a significant effect in explaining anxiety and peritraumatic stress symptoms during the pandemic among trauma survivors in general, its effect was significantly stronger among participants who were exposed to CTS than among participants who had been exposed to traumatic events that had ended.\nSuffering from PTSD symptoms is highly debilitating. Vivid intrusive recollections, emotional numbness, and hyperreactivity in response to trauma reminders severely interfere with the daily lives of affected individuals and are likely to take a toll when such individuals are exposed to an additional stressor. That said, coping with such difficulties while still being exposed to an ongoing trauma could be even more devastating. Unceasing exposure to trauma leads to a substantial degradation of individuals' psychological, social, and economic resources (e.g.,), and this degradation could in turn limit one's capacity to handle a new stressor. Furthermore, the reality of ongoing threat/danger not only deprives one of the opportunity to experience recovery in a safe and protected environment, but also repeatedly confirms a sense of threat and helplessness. As such, the negative effects of the ongoing trauma and subsequent PTSD symptoms on coping with an additional stressor might be particularly potent.\nAlthough the current study contributes to the understanding of psychological distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic among individuals previously exposed to trauma and CTS, it has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design precludes any conclusions regarding causal relations between the study variables. Second, this study relied on convenience sampling and, similar to other surveys conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, suffered from an overrepresentation of the female gender which might reflect higher response rates in surveys among women. Furthermore, only participants who provided data regarding the study variables were included in this study: a group that was characterized by greater proportions of female and secular individuals as well as by a higher average age compared to participants who were not included in the study. Although religiosity was not associated with psychological distress outcomes, and gender and age were controlled for in the present analyses, this limitation should be acknowledged prior to generalizing from the results to the population at large. Third, this study did not include measures of potential protective factors, such as social support. Lastly, this study was based on self-reported data which may be subject to response biases and shared method variance. Future studies among a variety of populations, and specifically among gender-balanced samples, should include data from clinical interviews.\nDespite these limitations, this study represents a step towards understanding the relations between trauma exposure and psychological distress in the face of an additional stressor. The present findings suggest that trauma survivors might be at risk for elevated distress following COVID-19, and that individuals who are exposed to ongoing traumatic stress and who suffer from PTSD symptoms might be the most vulnerable to psychiatric symptomatology related to COVID-19.\nThe present study has important clinical implications. Its results point to the need to provide clinical interventions to trauma survivors during this pandemic, and particularly to individuals exposed to CTS. Survivors of previous traumatic events (that are not ongoing) might benefit from evidence-based treatments such as trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT), which could be provided online and would tap specific challenges that survivors might experience when dealing with the pandemic. Individuals exposed to CTS, on the other hand, need specific clinical interventions that are tailored to the particular struggles that they face. Treatment for individuals exposed to CTS should be directed towards managing anxiety and physical symptoms, and the acquisition of day-to-day coping skills, and not on a reprocessing of the trauma, as is generally done when treating survivors of traumatic events that are not ongoing. One of the main goals of CTS treatment is to teach patients to differentiate between adapting to an actual danger versus symptomatic reactions to trauma reminders. Core elements of stress management therapy such as relaxation, breathing exercises, and mindfulness-based practices might be beneficial (e.g.,) and a biopsychosocial approach, which is based on cognitive behavioral methods, might also be effective for individuals exposed to CTS. Given that numerous populations around the world are exposed to CTS, providing these clinical tools via online mental health services during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is of substantial value. Although some nations are beginning to see the end of the pandemic's first wave, it is generally believed that another and potentially worse second wave will return in the fall, a situation which calls urgently for preparation and precautions.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe author does not have any conflict of interests to disclose.\nReferences\nWhy is depression more prevalent in women?\nAnxiety disorders: sex differences in prevalence, degree, and background, but gender-neutral treatment\nPsychometric properties of the PTSD checklist for diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-fifth edition (PCL-5) in veterans\nA second look at prior trauma and the posttraumatic stress disorder effects of subsequent trauma: a prospective epidemiological study\nThe psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: rapid review of the evidence\nDevelopment and validation of a brief self-report measure of trauma exposure: The Trauma History Screen.\nEpidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study\nOngoing traumatic stress response (OTSR) in Sderot, Israel\nThe consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and implications for clinical practice\nTrauma history as a predictor of psychologic symptoms in women with breast cancer\nPsychopathology, risk, and resilience under exposure to continuous traumatic stress: a systematic review of studies among adults living in southern Israel\nSARS control and psychological effects of quarantine, Toronto, Canada\nHayes, A.F., 2012.

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

it is unclear if this association is limited to cases where the earlier trauma led to PTSD.\n Resolution of this uncertainty has important implications for research on pre-trauma vulnerability to PTSD.\n We examined this issue in the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys with 34,676 respondents who reported lifetime trauma exposure.\n One lifetime trauma was selected randomly for each respondent.\n DSM-IV PTSD due to that trauma was assessed.\n We reported in a previous paper that four earlier traumas involving interpersonal violence significantly predicted PTSD after subsequent random traumas (OR=1.3–2.5).\n We also assessed 14 lifetime DSM-IV mood, anxiety, disruptive behavior, and substance disorders prior to random traumas.\n We show in the current report that only prior anxiety disorders significantly predicted PTSD in a multivariate model (OR=1.5–4.3) and that these disorders interacted significantly with three of the earlier traumas (witnessing atrocities, physical violence victimization, rape).\n History of witnessing atrocities significantly predicted PTSD after subsequent random traumas only among respondents with prior PTSD (OR=5.6).\n Histories of physical violence victimization (OR=1.5) and rape after age 17 (OR=17.6) significantly predicted only among respondents with no history of prior anxiety disorders.\n Although only preliminary due to reliance on retrospective reports, these results suggest that history of anxiety disorders and history of a limited number of earlier traumas might usefully be targeted in future prospective studies as distinct foci of research on individual differences in vulnerability to PTSD after subsequent traumas.\n","id":"PMC5858954","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The World

COVID-19 in multiple regions of China, a considerable proportion of health care workers reported experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, especially women, nurses, those

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":" Updates on the novel coronavirus outbreak up to March 2, 2020.

systematically searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycInfo databases and relevant reference lists.\n Observational studies investigating the associations between individual or contextual characteristics and professional help-seeking behaviour for emotional problems in adults formally diagnosed with major depression were included.\n The quality of the included studies was assessed, and factors associated with help-seeking behaviour were qualitatively synthesized.\n In total, 40 studies based on 26 datasets were included.\n Several studies investigated predisposing (age (N = 17), gender (N = 16), ethnicity (N = 9), education (N = 11), marital status (N = 12)), enabling (income (N = 12)), need (severity (N = 14), duration (N = 9), number of depressive episodes (N = 6), psychiatric comorbidity (N = 10)) and contextual factors (area (N = 8)).\n Socio-demographic and need factors appeared to influence help-seeking behaviour.\n Although existing studies provide insight into the characteristics associated with help seeking for major depression, cohort studies and research on beliefs about, barriers to and perceived need for treatment are lacking.\n Based on this review, interventions to increase help-seeking behaviour can be designed.\n","id":"PMC5426609","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Julia

the inclusion criteria.\n\n The synthesis identified support for the key framework themes.\n\n Women’s experiences of choosing or deciding where to give birth were influenced by whether they received information about available options and about the right to choose, women’s preferences for different services and their attributes, previous birth experiences, views of family, friends and health care professionals and women’s beliefs about risk and safety.\n\n The synthesis additionally identified that women’s access to choice of place of birth during the antenatal period varied.\n\n Planning to give birth in OU was straightforward, but although women considering birth in a setting other than hospital OU were sometimes well-supported, they also encountered obstacles and described needing to ‘counter the negativity’ surrounding home birth or birth in midwife-led settings.\n\n\nConclusions\nOver the period covered by the review, it was straightforward for low risk women to opt for hospital birth in the UK.\n\n Accessing home birth was more complex and contested.\n\n The evidence on freestanding midwifery units (FMUs) is more limited, but suggests that women wanting to opt for an FMU birth experienced similar barriers.\n\n The extent to which women experienced similar problems accessing alongside midwifery units (AMUs) is unclear.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online

to depression treatment: results of the Brazilian National Health Survey – PNS","abstract":"Background\nDespite depression being one of the most prevalent mental disorders in the world, access to treatment is still insufficient, especially in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n The aim of this study is to investigate differences in access to treatment for depression according to socio-demographic characteristics, geographical area and multi-morbidity in a nationally representative sample of individuals with depression.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study analyses data from the National Health Survey (Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde – PNS), a Brazilian household-based nationwide survey, which comprises 60,202 adults (aged 18 years or older).\n\n Depression was evaluated through the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).\n\n Prevalence Ratios and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using Poisson regression.\n\n\nResults\nThe general prevalence of depression was 7.9 % (95 % CI 7.5 to 8.3).\n\n Among those with depression, 78.8 % did not receive any treatment, and 14.1 % received only pharmacotherapy.\n\n Multivariable analyses showed that being female, white, aged between 30 and 69 years, living in regions other than the North, having higher education and having multi-morbidities were independently associated with higher likelihood of access to any treatment.\n\n\nConclusions\nMost Brazilians with clinically relevant depressive symptoms are not receiving any treatment.\n\n Access to care is unequal, with the poor and those living in low resource areas having higher difficulties to access mental health care.\n\n Understanding these disparities is important for the provision of effective interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of depression and inequities in access to mental health care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5112732","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Claudia

findings from the National Health Survey","abstract":"Background\nIntegrating mental health into primarily health care and studying risk for mental health particularly depression needs assessment of different factors including those that impede diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.\n\n But so far the numbers of literature for local context to analyze risk factors for depression and its treatment are scare.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess risk factors and health service attendance for depression among adults, in Ethiopia.\n\n\nMethods\nFor this analysis, data from the Ethiopian National health survey was used.\n\n The Ethiopian national health survey studied 4,925 adults aged 18 years and older to obtain among other things, data on depression episodes, socio-demographic, chronic diseases, life style factors and treatment receiving for depression episodes in the past twelve months using questionnaire from world health organization (WHO).\n\n Prevalence of Depression in respondents based on ICD-10 criteria was estimated and logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for depression and treatment receiving.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of depressive episode was 9.1% (95% CI: 8.39-9.90).\n\n In a Univariate analysis, residence, age, marital status, educational status, number of diagnosed chronic non communicable diseases (heart diseases, diabetic mellitus and arthritis) and alcohol drinking status were associated with depression.\n\n After full adjustment for possible confounding, odds ratios for depression were significantly higher only for older age, divorced and widowed, number of diagnosed chronic non communicable diseases and alcohol drinking status.\n\n The proportion of attending health service among those with depression episodes was 22.9%.\n\n After full control for all socio-demographic variables the only predictor variable was educational status, being in grade 5–8 had a higher odds (OR=2.6, 95% CI: 1.23-5.43) and 9–12 grade (OR=1.8 95% CI: 1.45-6.12) of attending service for depressive episodes.\n\n\nConclusions\nAge, marital status, number of diagnosed chronic non communicable diseases and alcohol consumption were the most important risk factors for depressive episodes.\n\n Generally there was lower use of health service for depressive episodes and low educational status was found to be barriers for service use.\n\n There is a need to formulate policy for mental health and training of primary health care workers in mental health to early identify and treat cases with depression episodes, so as to decrease prevalence of depression episodes and to improve accessibility of service use.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3511231","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Therefore, it is important to gain a better understanding of the reasons why people do or do not seek help.\n\n This study examined what predisposing and need factors are associated with help-seeking among people with major depression.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional study was conducted in 102 subjects with major depression.\n\n Respondents were recruited from the general population in collaboration with three Municipal Health Services (GGD) across different regions in the Netherlands.\n\n Inclusion criteria were: being aged 18 years or older, a high score on a screening instrument for depression (K10?&gt;?20), and a diagnosis of major depression established through the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1).\n\n\nResults\nOf the total sample, 65 % (n?=?66) had

concerning that stigma was related to less help-seeking.\n\n Knowledge and understanding of depression should be promoted in society, hopefully leading to reduced stigma and increased help-seeking.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4806501","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Anke

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30260-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","abstract":"Background\nSince Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak.\n\n Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020.

Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days.\n Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor.\n The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%.\n The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19.

Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for Chinese residents to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices.\n Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to populations of a low socioeconomic status.\n","id":"PMC7098034","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Ivyspring International Publisher","authors":[{"firstname":"Bao-Liang","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hai-Mei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qian-Qian","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Ge","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wen-Tian","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Weathers, F., Litz, B., Keane, T., Palmieri, T., Marx, B.P., Schnurr, P., 2013.

Post-infection physical discomforts and the presence of family members or relatives being infected are significantly associated with more symptoms of stress response, anxiety, and depression. Good social support and retirement were inversely associated with stress response. Female survivors reported more severe stress response symptoms than males. The survivors aged 60 and above experienced fewer stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression and fewer anxiety symptoms than survivors of other ages.\nThe finding of this study highlights the need to pay special attention to the mental state of COVID-19 survivors. Screening for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention is recommended to all COVID survivors both under quarantine and after quarantine. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at-high-risk. The current study also contributes to the geriatric psychiatry by indicating the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress symptoms and anxiety symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger adults.\nObjective\nTo examine the psychological distress and the associated predictor factors of the 2019 corona-virus disease (COVID-19) on survivors in the early convalescence in Shenzhen.\nMethod\nA survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis.\nResults\nA total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS, and SAS were 45.5 +- 18.9, 47.3 +- 13.1, and 43.2 +- 10.2, respectively, meanwhile, 9 (31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48 (38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and postinfection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors.\nConclusion\nThe occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at high-risk. Besides, the results indicated the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress response symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger ones.\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE\n2019 corona-virus disease (COVID-19) is highly contagious. Since the first case reported in early December 2019, the epidemic has transmitted throughout China and many other countries and was declared as a &quot;public emergency of international concern&quot; by the World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee. In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Chinese government has been implementing strict self- and forced-quarantine measure across the country. Widespread unbearable psychological pressure and distress were reported. Patients who suffered from COVID-19, in many ways, are similar to those who have experienced the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), also experiencing mental problems, including PTSD, anxiety, and depression, even after they have been cured and discharged from hospital. Previous experiences highlight the need to pay attention to the mental health of COVID-19 survivors.\nCurrently, few epidemiological data are available on the mental health problems and psychiatric morbidity of those diagnosed with COVID-19. Accumulating cases reported recurrence of positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA.   To minimize the risk of infection, the COVID-19 survivors in convalescence must quarantine and undergo clinical observation for 14 days after being cured and discharged from hospital in Shenzhen, China. Shenzhen Samii Medical Center (SSMC) is the location for isolation and observation of COVID-19 convalescent survivors designated by Shenzhen Municipal Health Commission, rendering it a suitable place to identify eligible study subjects. Our study examined the psychological distress and its associated predictor factors of COVID-19 convalescent survivors who were still under quarantine in SSMC.\nThe older adults are the fastest growing age demographic. Literature exploring older adults' experience of traumatic events and development of mental health problems indicates that psychiatric disorders are more prevalent among this population than previously assumed. Therefore, the current study also aims to contribute to a growing body of research in the area of geriatric psychiatry by evaluating differences in symptoms of psychological distress and its correlates among COVID-19 survivors across their lifespan.\nMETHOD\nParticipants\nAll cured COVID-19 patients, according to the Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (the seventh trial edition) published by the National Health Commission of China, were discharged from the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen and then transferred to SSMC for a 14-day quarantine from 20th February to 15th March, 2020. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of SSMC. A total of 126 COVID-19 survivors enrolled in the current study.\nMeasures\nPost-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS)\nPTSD-SS is a self-report measure developed by Chinese experts Liu, et al. to capture the level of symptomatic responses to a specific traumatic stressor. The scale has demonstrated high internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.92, good test-retest reliability and validity. The scale contains 24 items and 5 subscales, namely subjective assessment of traumatic events, intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal, and impaired social function. The degree of distress for each item is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from the absence of a symptom (score of 1) to maximal symptoms (score of 5). For symptoms of intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal, scores of each subscale were calculated and an average score above 2 was used as the cutoff value. A cut-score of 50 on the PTSD-SS total score indicated the clinically significant stress response. The higher the score, the more severe the stress reaction. \nSelf-rating depression scale (SDS)\nSDS (William W.K.Zung, 1965) is a self-report instrument designed to detect symptoms related to depression and to measure the severity of depression in the general medical outpatient population. It contains 20 declarative sentences and corresponding question items, reflecting 4 specific symptoms of depression: emotional symptoms, physical symptoms, psychomotor disorder, and psychological disorders. All items are rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from the absence of a symptom (score of 1) to maximal symptoms (score of 4), for each item related to the 4 specific symptoms. A standard score of 53 (equal to the original raw score of 41) was used as the cut-score for Chinese clinical significance. The higher the score, the more severe the depressive mood.\nSelf-rating anxiety scale (SAS)\nSAS (William W.K. Zung, 1971) is a self-rating scale designed to detect symptoms related to anxiety in the general medical outpatient population. SAS is very similar to SDS in the items contributed to the scale and the specific evaluation method. A standard score of 50 (equal to the original raw score of 40) was used as the cut-score for clinical significance. \nProcedures\nAn online survey questionnaire, consisting of PTSD-SS, SAS, and SDS was delivered to those who consented to join the study via WeChat, a popular Chinese mobile messenger app, to collect information about COVID-19 related psychological variables. Information about sociopsychological variables was collected by telephone interviews, including social support (the number of people with whom they could talk and share their worries), presence of family members or close relatives being infected, bereavement due to COVID-19, postinfection physical discomforts, history of psychiatric disorders, and history of psychoactive substance abuse. Medical records were reviewed to collect information about medical background and overall medical parameters of COVID-19.\nStatistical Analysis\nData were analyzed with the SPSS Version 23.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics 23). The percentage of subjects of all ages and of subjects aged 60 and above who met the cutoffs for outcome measures is summarized in Table 2. However, the total scores of the scales and the relevant subscales were tested as dependent variables, as our main interest focused on symptoms of psychological distress rather than the diagnosis. Tests of normality related to the distribution of the scores of each scale were significant, indicating a non-normal distribution. To investigate correlates of psychological symptoms, scores of each scale and subscale were the dependent variables in the statistical analysis. A nonparametric test, Mann-Whitney test, was used to investigate the effects of discrete predictor variables, Pearson correlations was used for continuous predictor variables. Stepwise regression analysis was used to examine the association between the covariates with a p value below 0.1 and scores of each scale and subscale. A p value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the Participants\nCharacteristics of the Participants (n = 126)\nTABLE 1	 	\n	Variables	N (%) or mean+-S.D	 	Demographic information	Age (year)	45.7 +- 14.0	 	Age groups	Older age	26 (20.6%)	 	Younger age	100 (89.4%)	 	Gender	Female	66 (52.4%)	 	Male	60 (47.6%)	 	Education background	High education	73 (57.9%)	 	Non-high education	53 (42.1%)	 	Profession	Retired	32(25.4%)	 	Not retired	94 (74.6%)	 	Social variables	Social support	Good social support	30 (23.8%)	 	Low social support	96 (76.2%)	 	Presence of infected family members or close relatives	Yes	73 (57.9%)	 	No	53 (42.1%)	 	Bereavement due to COVID-19	Yes	1 (0.8%)	 	No	125 (99.2%)	 	Medical history	History of chronic medical illnesses	Yes	24 (19%)	 	No	102 (81%)	 	History of psychiatric problems	Yes	23 (18.3%)	 	No	103 (81.7%)	 	Overall medical parameters of COVID-19	Days of hospitalization (day)	25.4 +- 7.1	 	Treatment of intravenous glucocorticoids	Yes	16 (12.7%)	 	No	110 (87.3%)	 	Respiratory support	Yes	22 (17.5%)	 	No	104 (82.5%)	 	Clinical type and diagnosis of COVID-19	Mild illness - moderate pneumonia	111 (88.1%)	 	Severe pneumonia - ARDS	15 (11.9%)	 	Postinfection physical discomforts	Yes	16 (12.7%)	 	No	110 (87.3%)	 	\nNote. ARDS: acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n Table 1 indicates the social demographic and medical characteristics of the subjects included in the current study. Among the participants, 66 (52.4%) were women. Their ages ranged from 11 to 72 (mean = 45.7; SD = 14.0). In China, people aged 60 or above are defined as older adults. Therefore, the current study divided those aged 60 or above into the older adults group and those under 60 into the younger group, with in the former 26 (20.6%) and 100 (79.4%) in the latter. Those who had received college education or above were regarded as having received high education, with 73 (57.9%) in this group, and the remaining 53 (42.1%) who had a lower level of education were divided into the non-high education group. There was only one medical staff participant in this study. Thirty-two (25.4%) participants were retired and 96 (76.2%) were working or studying and faced resultant pressure. Regarding the number of people with whom they could talk and share their worries, 30 (23.8%) reported low social support, while 93 (73.8%) reported good social support. Seventy-three (57.9%) participants had family members or relatives diagnosed with COVID-19, among whom only one reported bereavement due to COVID-19.\nAs for medical history, 24 (19%) subjects reported a history of one or more chronic medical illnesses. Twenty-three (18.3%) participants had a history of psychiatric disorders, with 2 having a history of depressive moods but no clinical diagnosis, 4 had a history of anxious moods, and 17 had a history of chronic insomnia. None of the subjects in the study reported a prior diagnosis of PTSD or other psychiatric diagnoses. And none reported a history of psychoactive substance abuse.\nOverall medical parameters of COVID-19, including hospitalization days, intravenous use of glucocorticoids, respiratory support including additional oxygen inhalation and ventilator assistance, and the clinical type and diagnosis of COVID-19, were obtained after checking their medical records. The hospitalization duration varied from 10 to 49 days (mean = 25.4; SD = 7.1). Sixteen (12.7%) participants had received intravenous glucocorticoids treatment and 22 (17.5%) once required respiratory support. One hundred and eleven (88.1%) participants were diagnosed with mild illnesses (n = 23) or moderate pneumonia (n = 88), and the remaining 15 (11.9%) had severe pneumonia (n = 14) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, n = 1). Using telephone interviews, 16 (12.7%) participants reported persistent physical discomfort post infection, with gastrointestinal symptoms and respiratory symptoms being common complaints.\nResults of the Scales and Occurrence Rate of Psychiatric Distress, Including Subgroup Analysis of Older Adults\nOverall Information of Scale/Subscale Scores and Pyschological Distress of All Ages and of the Older\nTABLE 2	 	\n	Scores of all subjects (n = 126) (mean +- S.D)	Na (%)	Scores of the older survivors (n = 26) (mean +- S.D)	Nb (%)	 	PTSD	45.5 +- 18.9	39 (31%)	39.5 +- 15.6	7 (26.9%)	 	 Intrusion	15.4 +- 6.8	52 (41.2%)	13.3 +- 5.6	8 (30.8%)	 	 Avoidance	11.9 +- 5.7	35 (27.7%)	10.8 +- 5.0	8 (30.8%)	 	 Hyperarousal	11.3 +- 5.0	51 (40.4%)	9.7 +- 3.7	8 (30.8%)	 	Anxiety	43.2 +- 10.2	28 (22.2%)	33.2 +- 6.4	3 (11.5%)	 	Depression	47.3 +- 13.1	48 (38.1%)	39.6 +- 10.5	12 (46.2%)	 	 Emotional symptoms	2.8 +- 1.1	25 (19.8%)	2.2 +- 0.4	0	 	 Physical symptoms	15.6 +- 4.0	68 (53.9%)	16.5 +- 3.9	16 (61.5%)	 	 Psychomotor symptoms	4.6 +- 2.3	81 (64.2%)	5.2 +- 2.2	21 (80.8%)	 	Psychological symptoms	15.1 +- 5.3	57 (45.2%)	15.7 +- 5.3	11 (42.3%)	 	\nNote.

Co-morbidity of clinically significant stress response, anxiety, and depression was 11.9% (n = 15). Table 2 reports the overall information of scores of each scale and subscale and the proportions of psychological distress for subjects of all ages and subjects aged 60 and above. Details related to the significant findings between the older subjects and the younger subjects are reported in Tables 3 and 4 .\nThe mean score on PTSD-SS among all survivors and among the older survivors was 45.5 (SD = 18.9) and 39.5 (SD = 15.6) respectively. Those with clinically significant stress response accounted for a percentage of 31% among all survivors and 26.9% among the older survivors. Mann-Whitney test indicated that the older survivors experienced less severe stress response symptoms than younger ones (26 versus 100, z = -2.057, p = 0.04). Mean raw scores on SAS among all subjects and among the older subjects were 43.2 (SD = 10.2) and 33.2 (SD = 6.4), respectively. Survivors with clinically significant anxiety symptoms accounted for 22.2% among all survivors and 11.5% among the older survivors. The older subjects reported less severe anxiety symptoms than the younger ones, which was not significant as per the Mann-Whitney test, but significant as per stepwise regression analysis (beta = -0.168, t = -2.041, df = 123, p = 0.045). Mean raw scores on SDS among all subjects and among the older subjects were 47.3 (SD = 13.1) and 39.6 (SD = 10.5), respectively. Survivors with clinically significant depression symptoms accounted for 38.1% among all survivors and 46.2% among the older survivors respectively. No significant difference in the severity of depression symptoms was found between the older survivors and the survivors of other ages. However, stepwise regression analysis indicated that older age had a significant inverse association with the severity of emotional symptoms of depression (beta = -0.378, t = -4.582, df = 122, p &lt; 0.001).\nPredictors Associated with Symptoms of Psychological Distress Among the COVID-19 Survivors\n Table 3 reports the predictive factors of psychological distress symptoms with significant difference or with p value below 0.1 suggested by Mann-Whitney test. Table 4 reports significant predictors of psychological distress symptoms indicated by Stepwise Regression analysis.\nRetired subjects scored significantly lower on PTSD-SS than those who had not retired (32 versus 84, z = -2.832, p = 0.005). Stepwise regression analysis suggested that retirement had significant inverse associations with PTSD-SS scores, including intrusion and avoidance scores, but the association between hyperarousal, SAS, and SDS scores was not significant. The female subjects scored significantly higher on PTSD-SS than the male subjects (66 versus 60, z = -2.150, p = 0.032). And being female was found to be significantly related to depressive emotional and PTSD-SS scores, including intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance scores, but its association with SAS, SDS, and other depression subscale scores was not significant. The subjects reporting good social support were prone to lower depressive emotional and PTSD-SS scores, including Intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance scores, than those reporting poor social support. But the relationship between social support and SAS, SDS, and other depression subscale scores was not significant. The presence of family members or close relatives infected was significantly related to all scale and subscale scores except avoidance scores. Post-infection physical discomfort was significantly related to scores of PTSD-SS, intrusion, hyperarousal, SAS, SDS, and physical symptoms of depression, but its association with avoidance scores and other depression subscales was not significant. Associations between older age and psychological distress symptoms were reported above (seen in paragraph 3.1). No significant association was found between medical parameters of COVID-19 or medical history and psychological distress symptoms.\nAs for the strength of predictors on psychological distress symptoms, the relationship between social support and PTSD-SS scores was strong (beta = -0.295, t = -3.561, df = 121, p = 0.001), wherein the predictive strength on avoidance and intrusion scores was the strongest (beta = -0.355, t = -4.213, df = 123, p &lt;0.001; beta = -0.271, t = -3.245, df = 121, p = 0.002, respectively). While the association between retirement and PTSD-SS scores was significant (beta = -0.279, t = -3.417, df = 121, p = 0.001), which overshadowed the relationship between older age and PTSD-SS, the relationship between older age and hyperarousal score was the strongest (beta = -0.267, t = -3.235, df = 121, p = 0.002). The presence of family members or close relatives infected was the strongest predictor of SAS (beta = 0.331, t = 4.077, df = 123, p &lt;0.001) and SDS scores (beta = 0.386, t = 4.757, df = 124, p &lt;0.001). Older age had the strongest relationship with the emotional symptoms score of depression (beta = -0.378, t = -4.82, df = 122, p &lt;0.001).\nDISCUSSION\nTo the best of our knowledge, the current study is one of the few to present data on the short-term mental health consequences of COVID-19. The overall prevalence of psychological distress among the 126 COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence is 54.8%, with 31%, 22.2%, and 38.1% meeting the criteria for excessive stress, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Previous studies worldwide indicated the incidence of mental disorders after major disasters was from 10% to 20%.   Our results are much higher than that. The possible reasons are speculated as follows. First, the features of COVID-19, being highly contagious,   lack of antiviral drugs with definite efficacy and the possibility of recurrence of the positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in convalescence,   lead to widespread fears, horrors, and worries. Second, with the popularization of internet and smart-phones, people are overwhelmed with all kinds of information, resulting in more misunderstandings about the disease, excessive worries, and unnecessary fears. A recent study found that heavy media use increases the incidence of PTSD and depression in social unrest. Third, the isolation from family members and friends brings out helplessness and loneliness. Idleness during the isolation period is likely to lead to an increase in negative mood states, as well as worry about one's physical health. Fourth, as indicated by the burden hypothesis, the COVID-19 epidemic affects employment and incomes of most families, which adds to psychological distress. Fifth, remorse and worries about the infection of family members and close relatives add to more passive emotions, strongly supported by the significant associations between the presence of family members or close relatives and all kinds of psychological symptoms indicated by the current study. Last, with respect to telephone interviews, a majority of the survivors found that they were afraid of being stigmatized because they were infected and that they were overwhelmed with the idea they may be henceforth treated differently. Apart from the dramatically high incidence of short-term psychological problems indicated by the current study, data from previous studies on SARS about 1-year psychological distress indicated that survivors may develop more persistent psychological disorders with time after recovering from infectious diseases. Therefore, we suggested that all COVID-19 survivors should be screened for stress disorder, anxiety, and depression regularly to identify those with psychological distress for timely intervention.\nTo help identify the COVID-19 survivors at-high-risk for psychological problems, the current study suggested several predictors significantly associated with the development of psychological distress. The presence of infected family members or close relatives was associated with more symptoms of stress, anxiety as well as depression, wherein, the strength of association with stress symptoms was weak, while with depression and anxiety symptoms were strong. Concerns about the health problems of infected family members and guilt of being a source of infection lead to deterioration of mood, adding to more depression and anxiety symptoms, which may degrade and vanish as loved ones recover, or deteriorate and persist otherwise. Postinfection physical discomfort had minor associations with stress and depression symptoms, but it showed a high predictive value for more severe anxiety symptoms. As physical discomforts may be the cause as well as the effect of passive emotions, we failed to distinguish the confounding effects. Good social support was strongly associated with less severe stress symptoms and emotional symptoms of depression in the current study, consistent with the results found by previous studies that good social support helps to alleviate the emotional stress associated with traumatic events.   Being female was moderately related to more severe stress symptoms and emotional symptoms of depression, corresponding to the findings of previous studies about SARS related psychological distress, which indicated that being female leads to more vulnerability to stress events. Retirement was found to be associated with less severe stress symptoms, which may be explained by the burden hypothesis that those who had not retired are at higher risk for psychological distress because of greater social and financial responsibilities. The association between older age and psychological distress and the confounding effects between retirement and older age will be discussed later. The current study found no significant associations between psychological distress and the survivors' educational background, medical history including history of psychiatric disorders as well as overall medical parameters of COVID-19. On one hand, it may be that the huge social-psycho impact brought by the COVID-19 epidemic exceeds the decisive role of the disease itself. On the other hand, the relevant information was collected by the survivors' recall and dictation, which may lead to information inaccuracy, especially history of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, the subjects included in the current study all completed the online questionnaire by themselves, which indicates that they all had access to online sources of information, thus attenuating the impact of educational background.\nThe current study also contributes to knowledge of geriatric psychiatry, specifically about older survivors' psychological response to infectious diseases. Although the relationship between older age and PTSD-SS scores was overshadowed by that of retirement and PTSD-SS scores in Stepwise Regression analysis, Mann-Whitney test suggested that older COVID-19 survivors were about less than twice as likely to develop excessive stress symptoms. Moreover, older age was found to be strongly related to less severe hyperarousal symptoms and emotional symptoms of depression, and minorly associated with less severe anxiety symptoms. No significant difference was found between older COVID-19 survivors and the younger survivors for depression symptoms. Our findings about stress response corresponds to a prior study that found people over 60 years old had significantly fewer PTSD symptoms than all other age groups. Community-based surveys also confirmed that PTSD symptoms were less prevalent among the older population. A meta-analysis concerning post human induced disasters came to the same conclusion as ours that older adults (with the age above 65) were about less than twice as likely to experience PTSD symptoms, while finding no significant difference between older adults and younger adults for depression. Our finding, that, compared with survivors of other ages, older COVID-19 survivors reported fewer emotional symptoms and fewer anxiety symptoms, indicates that the older adults had less emotional reactivity to the infection, which may protect them from excessive stress response. Similar findings have been reported in previous studies and several theories may explain why.       Prior experiences, as cognitive theory suggested, make it less likely for the older adults to incorporate traumatic events as a central part of their identity than the younger population, and, as inoculation hypothesis suggested, may result in decreased emotional reactivity to subsequent exposure among the older adults. Besides, maturation helps the older adults develop an adaptive coping style with greater resilience to psychological distress than the younger adults. According to the burden hypothesis, older adults bear fewer social and financial responsibilities during the traumatic events than the younger adults. It may also explain why the retired COVID-19 survivors suffer less psychological distress than the ones who had not in the current study. Most of the older survivors belong to the retirement group. Older age and retirement may have a mutual influence on psychological response. However, we failed to eliminate the confounding effects between older age and retirement as a result of a small sample size in the stratified analysis.\nThere are a few limitations of this study. Online questionnaire surveys screened out those survivors who did not know how to use smartphones, failing to get psychological data from those with low levels of education or very old individuals and who were inaccessible to online information. The participants were COVID-19 patients cured and under quarantine in the hospital designated by the government in Shenzhen city, where medical sources and daily necessities were abundant. In some countries people have been forced to quarantine in their own homes rather than in government designated center, which may have significant impact on the COVID-19 survivors' mental well being. Therefore, the present findings may not be readily generalized to all COVID-19 survivors. Besides, the current study was conducted at an early stage of recovery. Psychological distress may improve with time as the survivors return to normal routines or as their infected family members get better. Stress response symptoms may be over-reported in the present study, especially in young individuals who are concerned about returning to work. Such findings should be further substantiated by the administration of outpatient follow-ups, after quarantine, for PTSD and mood disorder to differentiate it from other diagnoses such as adjustment disorders. There is also limitation in statistical analysis. The number of statistical tests was huge and type I error was inflated in the current study. In this retrospective study, small number of participants may limit the power of finding significant relationships between predictor variables and psychological distress not indicated by the current study.\nCONCLUSION\nThe current study presents data on the short-term mental health consequences of COVID-19, suggesting that COVID-19 survivors during early convalescence suffer a high incidence of psychological distress, including excessive stress, anxiety and depressive moods, which may improve after quarantine. However, data from previous studies of 1-year SARS related psychological distress indicated that survivors may develop more persistent psychological disorders with time after recovering from infectious diseases. Therefore, we suggested all COVID-19 survivors, both undergoing quarantine and after quarantine, should be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. Predictors significantly associated with COVID-19 related psychological distress suggested by the study may help identify those at-high-risk for timely interventions. Besides, the current study contributed to accumulating data on geriatric psychiatry, specifically about older adults' psychological responses to infectious diseases, indicating that older COVID-19 survivors have less emotional reactivity to infection, fewer anxiety symptoms and fewer stress reaction symptoms than younger survivors.\nReferences\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): the epidemic and the challenges\nTimely mental health care for the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is urgently needed\nThe mental health of medical workers in Wuhan, China dealing with the 2019 novel coronavirus\nImmediate psychological responses and associated factors during the initial stage of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic among the general population in China\nThe SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest global health threats: what lessons have we learned?

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

antimalarial agents.\n Apart from this antimalarial activity, CQ and HCQ have gained interest in the field of other infectious diseases.\n One of the most interesting mechanisms of action is that CQ leads to alkalinisation of acid vesicles that inhibit the growth of several intracellular bacteria and fungi.\n The proof of concept of this effect was first used to restore intracellular pH allowing antibiotic efficacy for Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, and doxycycline plus HCQ is now the reference treatment for chronic Q fever.\n There is also strong evidence of a similar effect in vitro against Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple's disease, and a clinical trial is in progress.\n Other bacteria and fungi multiply in an acidic environment and encouraging in vitro data suggest that this concept may be generalised for all intracellular organisms that multiply in an acidic environment.\n For viruses, CQ led to inhibition of uncoating and/or alteration of post-translational modifications of newly synthesised proteins, especially inhibition of glycosylation.\n These effects have been well described in vitro for many viruses, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being the most studied.\n Preliminary in vivo clinical trials suggest that CQ alone or in combination with antiretroviral drugs might represent an interesting way to treat HIV infection.\n

disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.\n Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

(one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth.\n The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation.\n We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0.\n Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.\n The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403–540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18–25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.\n We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49–2.63).\n Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.\n","id":"PMC7074332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Shi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinjun","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangpu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daozhou","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

next lethal viral epidemic that occurs.\n\n\nMethod\nThe 1995 Kikwit Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formally Zaire) is one of the most well studied epidemics to have occurred to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nWhen an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered.\n\n Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities.\n\n The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral lessons from the outbreak include the importance of having simple, well-defined triage procedures; staff who are flexible and able to adapt to situations with unknowns; and the need to protect staff

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities.\n At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down.\n It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities.\n Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma.\n The severity of this epidemic and its long-lasting repercussions

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire.\n\n Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access.\n\n\nIn addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6).\n\n The total Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n The perceived dangerous Pollutant

Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic.\n Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.","id":"PMC7139239","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Amr H.","surname":"Sawalha","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Coit","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qianjin","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Michaud K, Wipfler K, Shaw Y, Simon TA, Cornish A, England BR, Ogdie A, Katz P (2020) Experiences of patients with rheumatic diseases in the US during early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

COVID-19 in China\nThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been rapidly transmitted globally. With the increasing number of infected cases and deaths, many patients experienced both physical suffering and great psychological distress. In China, a range of guidelines and expert consensus have been developed by health authorities and academic associations. Crisis mental health interventions, such as online education and counseling services, have been widely adopted nationwide (Liu et al.,).\nAccording to the treatment guidelines in China, COVID-19 patients need to be treated in isolated hospitals. Due to social isolation, perceived danger, uncertainty, physical discomfort, medication side effects, fear of virus transmission to others, and negative news on social media, patients with COVID-19 may experience loneliness, anger, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (Wu, Chan, &amp; Ma,; Xiang et al.,), which could negatively affect individuals' social and occupational functioning, and quality of life (Monson, Caron, McCloskey, &amp; Brunet,; North et al.,). To date, no studies on the pattern of posttraumatic stress symptoms among COVID-19 patients have been reported. Therefore, we examined the pattern of posttraumatic stress symptoms in clinically stable COVID-19 patients. We also explored patients' attitude toward crisis mental health services during the COVID-19 outbreak.\nOnline assessment was incorporated as part of the crisis psychological interventions. Patients were invited to participate in this online assessment prior to their discharge from five quarantine facilities ('Fang Cang' hospitals) in Wuhan, Hubei province in March 2020. 'Fang Cang' hospitals refer to temporary quarantine hospital facilities converted from gymnasiums, exhibition centers and sports centers for clinically stable patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. To be eligible, participants should be adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 verified by patients' medical records, and clinically stable, as screened by patients' case medical officers. Participants were asked about their attitudes toward COVID-19-related online crisis mental health services, such as psycho-educational resources, and mental health counseling, using a standardized question: 'Do you think online psycho-educational resources and mental health counseling provision during the COVID-19 outbreak are helpful?' (yes/no). The amended self-reported Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist- Civilian Version (PCL-C) (Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, &amp; Keane,) was used to assess the severity of the posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the COVID-19. A total PCL-C score of &gt;=50 was considered 'having significant posttraumatic stress symptoms' (Yang, Yang, Liu, &amp; Yang,).\nA total of 730 COVID-19 patients were recruited in this study, of whom, 714 met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the participants was 50.2 +- 12.9 years, men accounted for 49.1% of the sample, and 25.8% lived alone prior to admission. The prevalence of significant posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the COVID-19 was 96.2% (95% CI 94.8-97.6%). Half of the participants (49.8%) considered psycho-educational services helpful.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this was the first study examining the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms in COVID-19 patients. It is noteworthy that most COVID-19 patients suffered from significant posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the disease prior to discharge, and these symptoms may lead to negative outcomes, such as lower quality of life and impaired working performance. Following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the prevalence of PTSD in SARS survivors was 9.79% in their early recovery phase (Fang, Zhe, &amp; Shuran,) and 25.6% at 30-month post-SARS assessment (Mak, Chu, Pan, Yiu, &amp; Chan,). Our findings were significantly higher than that of Fang's and Mak's. The remarkable differences between these studies could be attributed to different clinical diagnosis and illness phrases (e.g., clinically stable COVID-19 inpatients vs. SARS survivors) and different measurements (e.g., self-reported instrument on posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the COVID-19 vs. clinical diagnosis of PTSD established by professionals). The rapid transmission of COVID-19 alongside with demeaning news coverage in widely used communication programs (e.g. WeChat and Weibo), and social discrimination toward COVID-19 patients may result in higher prevalence of self-perceived posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the COVID-19 in this study.\nOf particular note was that only half of the patients hold positive attitudes toward online crisis mental health services. During the COVID-19 outbreak, most crisis mental health services for infected patients are delivered online. Many COVID-19 patients were older adults with limited time, and restricted access to internet and smartphones due to poor health status during hospitalization (Yang et al.,). Compared with on-site psychological interventions, online self-guided psycho-educational resources could be less effective, especially for those with reading difficulties and physical discomfort brought by COVID-19 and treatment side effects.\nIn conclusion, this study found that most clinically stable COVID-19 patients suffered from significant posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the COVID-19 prior to discharge. Considering the negative detrimental impact of significant posttraumatic stress symptoms, appropriate crisis psychological interventions and long-term follow-up assessments should be urgently initiated for COVID-19 survivors.\nFinancial support\nThe study was supported by the University of Macau (MYRG2019-00066-FHS).\nConflicts of interest\nNone.\nReferences\nSurvey on mental status of

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

in the Philippines\nHighlights\nStudents report moderate-to-severe psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTimely and adequate health information has protective psychological effect.\nHealth care workers are less likely to be psychologically affected.\nHome quarantine is associated with depression, anxiety and stress symptoms.\nBackground\nThe 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses a threat to societies' mental health. This study examined the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identified the factors contributing to psychological impact in the Philippines.\nMethods\nA total of 1879 completed online surveys were gathered from March 28-April 12, 2020. Collected data included socio-demographics, health status, contact history, COVID-19 knowledge and concerns, precautionary measures, information needs, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) ratings.\nResults\nThe IES-R mean score was 19.57 (SD=13.12) while the DASS-21 mean score was 25.94 (SD=20.59). In total, 16.3% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate-to-severe; 16.9% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% had moderate-to-severe anxiety levels; and 13.4% had moderate-to-severe stress levels.\nFemale gender; youth age; single status; students; specific symptoms; recent imposed quarantine; prolonged home-stay; and reports of poor health status, unnecessary worry, concerns for family members, and discrimination were significantly associated with greater psychological impact of the pandemic and higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p&lt;0.05).\nAdequate health information, having grown-up children, perception of good health status and confidence in doctors' abilities were significantly associated with lesser psychological impact of the pandemic and lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p&lt;0.05).\nLimitations\nAn English online survey was used.\nConclusion\nDuring the early phase of the pandemic in the Philippines, one-fourth of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety and one-sixth reported moderate-to-severe depression and psychological impact. The factors identified can be used to devise effective psychological support strategies.\nIntroduction\nThe 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. It may follow the influenza pandemic of 1918 in magnitude which affected about one-third of the world population and killed 50 million. To date, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, has affected 213 countries and territories around the world with 14 million cases and half a million deaths. Control efforts worldwide led to travel bans and restrictions. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte placed the entire Luzon archipelago on enhanced community quarantine on March 16, 2020. Curfew, check-points and travel restrictions were implemented. Business and school activities were suspended indefinitely. People were forced to stay in their homes.\nPrevious disease outbreaks caused generalized fear to the public and induced fear-related behaviors and anxiety. With the novel coronavirus plaguing the world, there are so many uncertainties with the disease with a possibility of a fatal outcome. There were reported manifestations of distress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia in general populations. The systematic review and meta-analysis done by among the general populations in Asia and Europe showed that the prevalence of stress was 29.6% (95% confidence interval, 24.3-35.4), anxiety was 31.9% (95% CI, 27.5-36.7) and depression was 33.7% (95% CI, 27.5-40.6).\nInfection or death of family and friends could worsen the overall mental health well-being of an individual. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 may experience fear, while those in quarantine might experience boredom, loneliness, and anger. Overwhelming deep emotional traumas and socio-economic stressors brought about by the pandemic and the lockdowns have even led the more vulnerable people to commit suicide.\nIt is imperative to determine the prevalence of adverse mental health issues in a society during this pandemic and mitigate its psychological risks and consequences. To date, there are no studies that examine the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to the general population in the Philippines. Therefore, this study aims to establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identify risk and protective factors contributing to psychological stress among social media users in the Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMethod\nParticipants and procedures\nFrom 28 March to 12 April 2020, when the entire Luzon Islands of the Philippines was under enhanced community quarantine, an online survey in English language was disseminated through the social media using snowball sampling technique. The survey included information on socio-demographics, personal symptoms, contact history, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures about COVID-19, information update on COVID-19, the validated Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument.\nEthics\nThis study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the University of the Philippines Manila (UPMREB 2020-198-01).\nStatistical analysis\nData analysis was performed using the SPSS Statistic 24.0 (IBM SPSS, New York, NY, USA). Frequency and percentage were applied to describe variables. The scores of IES-R and DASS-21 subscales were expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD). Association analysis using chi-square test was performed. P value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nDemographic variables and association with psychological impact (n=1879).\nTable 1	 	\nVariable	n (%)	Stress	Anxiety	Depression	Impact of Event	 			Normal and Mild n (%)	At least Moderate n (%)	p-value*	Normal and Mildn (%)	At least Moderaten (%)	p-value*	Normal and Mildn (%)	At least Moderaten (%)	p-value*	Normal and Mild n (%)	At least Moderaten (%)	p-value*	 	Gender				0.018			0.038			0.13			0.015	 	Female	1296 (69)	1106 (85.3)	190 (14.7)		904 (69.8)	392 (30.2)		1066 (82.3)	230 (17.7)		1067 (82.3)	229 (17.7)		 	Male	583 (31)	521 (89.4)	62 (10.6)		434 (74.4)	149 (25.6)		496 (85.1)	87 (14.9)		506 (86.8)	77 (13.2)		 	Age (years)				&lt;0.001			&lt;0.001			. &lt;0.001			&lt;0.001	 	12-21.4	430 (22.9)	345 (80.2)	85 (19.8)		269 (62.6)	161 (37.4)		317 (73.7)	113 (26.3)		332 (77.2)	98 (22.8)		 	21.4-30.8	426 (22.7)	350 (82.2)	76 (17.8)		285 (66.9)	141 (33.1)		344 (80.8)	82 (19.2)		340 (79.8)	86 (20.2)		 	30.8-40.2	425 (22.6)	366 (86.1)	59 (13.9)		297 (69.9)	128 (30.1)		353 (83.1)	72 (16.9)		353 (83.1)	72 (16.9)		 	40.2-49.6	303 (16.1)	285 (94.1)	18 (5.9)		238 (78.5)	65 (21.5)		271 (89.4)	32 (10.6)		275 (90.8)	28 (9.2)		 	&gt;49.6	295 (15.7)	281 (95.3)	14 (4.7)		249 (84.4)	46 (15.6)		277 (93.9)	18 (6.1)		273 (92.5)	22 (7.5)		 	Educational attainment				0.034			0.001			&lt;0.001			&lt;0.001	 	High school and lower	133 (7.1)	111 (83.5)	22 (16.5)		89 (66.9)	44 (33.1)		106 (79.7)	27 (20.3)		104 (78.2)	29 (21.8)		 	College	458 (24.4)	384 (83.8)	74 (16.2)		300 (65.5)	158 (34.5)		357 (77.9)	101 (22.1)		358 (78.2)	100 (21.8)		 	University: Bachelor	677 (36)	585 (86.4)	92 (13.6)		480 (70.9)	197 (29.1)		557 (82.3)	120 (17.7)		567 (83.8)	110 (16.2)		 	University: Masters or Doctorate	611 (32.5)	547 (89.5)	64 (10.5)		469 (76.8)	142 (23.2)		542 (88.7)	69 (11.3)		544 (89)	67 (11)		 	Residential country during the COVID-19 outbreak				0.357			0.807			0.83			0.433	 	Philippines	1816 (96.6)	1570 (86.5)	246 (13.5)		1294 (71.3)	522 (28.7)		1509 (83.1)	307 (16.9)		1518 (83.6)	298 (16.4)		 	Other	63 (3.4)	57 (90.5)	6 (9.5)		44 (69.8)	19 (30.2)		53 (84.1)	10 (15.9)		55 (87.3)	8 (12.7)		 	Marital status				&lt;0.001			&lt;0.001			&lt;0.001			&lt;0.001	 	Single	1196 (63.7)	996 (83.3)	200 (16.7)		800 (66.9)	396 (33.1)		953 (79.7)	243 (20.3)		964 (80.6)	232 (19.4)		 	Married	619 (32.9)	570 (92.1)	49 (7.9)		485 (78.4)	134 (21.6)		551 (89)	68 (11)		554 (89.5)	65 (10.5)		 	Divorced/separated	44 (2.3)	43 (97.7)	1 (2.3)		35 (79.5)	9 (20.5)		39 (88.6)	5 (11.4)		39 (88.6)	5 (11.4)		 	Widowed	20 (1.1)	18 (90)	2 (10)		18 (90)	2 (10)		19 (95)	1 (5)		16 (80)	4 (20)		 	Employment status				&lt;0.001			&lt;0.001			&lt;0.001			&lt;0.001	 	Student	548 (29.2)	442 (80.7)	106 (19.3)		353 (64.4)	195 (35.6)		419 (76.5)	129 (23.5)		421 (76.8)	127 (23.2)		 	Employed	1153 (61.4)	1023 (88.7)	130 (11.3)		841 (72.9)	312 (27.1)		978 (84.8)	175 (15.2)		992 (86)	161 (14)		 	Unemployed	69 (3.7)	61 (88.4)	8 (11.6)		55 (79.7)	14 (20.3)		64 (92.8)	5 (7.2)		63 (91.3)	6 (8.7)		 	Housewife	53 (2.8)	49 (92.5)	4 (7.5)		41 (77.4)	12 (22.6)		49 (92.5)	4 (7.5)		46 (86.8)	7 (13.2)		 	Farmers	4 (0.2)	3 (75)	1 (25)		3 (75)	1 (25)		3 (75)	1 (25)		3 (75)	1 (25)		 	Retired	52 (2.8)	49 (94.2)	3 (5.8)		45 (86.5)	7 (13.5)		49 (94.2)	3 (5.8)		48 (92.3)	4 (7.7)		 	Health care professional				0.034			0.146			0.028			0. 001	 	Yes	609 (32.4)	542 (89)	67 (11)		447 (73.4)	162 (26.6)		523 (85.9)	86 (14.1)		535 (87.8)	74 (12.2)		 	No	1270 (67.6)	1085 (85.4)	185 (14.6)		891 (70.2)	379 (29.8)		1039 (81.8)	231 (18.2)		1038 (81.7)	232 (18.3)		 	Parental status				&lt;0.001			&lt;0.001			&lt;0.001			0. 001	 	Not applicable	860 (45.8)	721 (83.8)	139 (16.2)		575 (66.9)	285 (33.1)		681 (79.2)	179 (20.8)		693 (80.6)	167 (19.4)		 	No children	376 (20)	314 (83.5)	62 (16.5)		261 (69.4)	115 (30.6)		309 (82.2)	67 (17.8)		310 (82.4)	66 (17.6)		 	Has child younger than 16 years	311 (16.6)	277 (89.1)	34 (10.9)		232 (74.6)	79 (25.4)		272 (87.5)	39 (12.5)		270 (86.8)	41 (13.2)		 	Has child older than 16 years	186 (9.9)	177 (95.2)	9 (4.8)		155 (83.3)	31 (16.7)		172 (92.5)	14 (7.5)		166 (89.2)	20 (10.8)		 	Has children older than 16 years and younger than 16 years	146 (7.8)	138 (94.5)	8 (5.5)		115 (78.8)	31 (21.2)		128 (87.7)	18 (12.3)		134 (91.8)	12 (8.2)		 	Household size				0.551			0.508			0.451			0.417	 	1 person	107 (5.7)	90 (84.1)	17 (15.9)		70 (65.4)	37 (34.6)		84 (78.5)	23 (21.5)		87 (81.3)	20 (18.7)		 	2 persons	173 (9.2)	149 (86.1)	24 (13.9)		120 (69.4)	53 (30.6)		140 (80.9)	33 (19.1)		138 (79.8)	35 (20.2)		 	3-5 persons	1022 (54.4)	895 (87.6)	127 (12.4)		735 (71.9)	287 (28.1)		857 (83.9)	165 (16.1)		862 (84.3)	160 (15.7)		 	6 persons or more	577 (30.7)	493 (85.4)	84 (14.6)		413 (71.6)	164 (28.4)		481 (83.4)	96 (16.6)		486 (84.2)	91 (15.8)		 	\nThe Chi-square statistic is significant at p&lt; 0.05 level.\nThere were 2037 completed surveys out of 2700 total respondents with a completion rate of 75.4%. Excluding 158 respondents who have a pre-existing neuropsychiatric condition, a total of 1879 responses were analyzed. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the participants. The majority were females (69%), well-educated (68.5%, at least a bachelor's degree), residents of the Philippines (96.6%), single (63.7%), employed (61.4%), non-health care professionals (67.6%), with no children (65.8%) and members of household size of 3-5 people (54.4%). The mean age of respondents was 34.5 years (SD, 13.4 years).\nMental health status of respondents\nRespondents' depression, anxiety and stress levels, measured using DASS-21 scale, revealed a sample mean score of 25.94 (SD =20.59). For the depression subscale, 1338 (71.2%) were considered to have a normal score (score: 0-9); 224 (11.9%) reported mild depressive symptoms (score: 10-12); 239 (12.7%) moderate depressive symptoms (scores 13-20); and 78 (4.2%) reported severe to extremely severe depressive symptoms (score: 21-42). For the anxiety subscale, 1157 (61.6%) reported normal scores (score: 0-6); 181 (9.6%) reported mild anxiety symptoms (score: 7-9); 333 (17.7%) reported moderate anxiety symptoms (score: 10-14); and 208 (11.1%) reported severe to extremely severe anxiety symptoms (scores 15-42). For the stress subscale, 1131 (60.2%) reported normal scores (score &lt;10); 496 (26.4%) reported mild stress signals (scores 11-18); 179 (9.5%) reported moderate stress signals (scores 19-26); and 73 (3.9%) reported severe to extremely severe stress signals (scores 27-42).\nThe psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak, measured using the IES-R scale, revealed a sample mean score of 19.57 (SD, 13.12). Of all respondents, 1277 (68%) reported minimal psychological impact (score: 0-23); 296 (15.8%) rated mild psychological impact (score: 24-32); and 306 (16.3%) reported a moderate to severe psychological impact (score: &gt;33).\nSociodemographic factors and association with psychological impact\n Table 1 shows that male respondents had significantly lower scores for stress (p=0.018), anxiety (p=0.038) and IES-R (p=0.015) compared to females. The young age group of 12-21.4 years, single people and those who had no children had significantly high stress, anxiety, depression and IES-R scores. The non-health care professionals (non-HCP) had significantly higher levels of stress (p=0.034) and depression signals (p=0.028) and higher IES-R score (p=0.001) than health care professionals (HCP). Student status was associated with high anxiety subscale scores (p&lt;0.001). Respondents who had higher level of education (Masters/Doctorate) and had (a) child/ren older than 16 years old had significantly lower DASS stress subscale, DASS anxiety subscale, DASS depression subscale and IES-R scores (p &lt;0.05). The socio-demographic variables household size and residential country during the outbreak were not associated with IES-R and DASS subscale scores.\nPhysical health status and association with

Only 1% of the sample had fever of at least 1 day within the 2 weeks prior to the survey and 0.4% had fever in combination with either cough or breathing difficulty. Other respondents reported chills (2.1%), headache (22.6%), body pain (11.1%), cough (14.4%), breathing difficulty (6.7%), dizziness (5.5%), sore throat (12.6%) and nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (3.1%). These symptoms were significantly associated with higher scores for IESR, DASS stress subscale, DASS anxiety subscale and DASS depression subscale. The presence of runny nose in 12.4% of participants is associated with higher score for DASS stress (p &lt;0.001), anxiety (p &lt;0.001) and depression (p =0.002) subscales. About 51.4% of respondents reported no symptom for the past 2 weeks.\nOverall, 5% of respondents consulted with a doctor in the clinic in the past 14 days; 0.3% were hospitalized; 0.5% were tested for COVID-19; and 2% had recent quarantine by health authority. Majority of the respondents rated their current health status as good; 20.1% reported suffering from a chronic illness and 57.6% had medical insurance coverage.\nRecent consultation with doctors in clinics, recent placement in quarantine by a health authority and poor to very poor current health status were associated with high scores in IES-R, DASS stress subscale, DASS anxiety subscale and DASS depression subscale. Having medical insurance coverage was associated with a lower DASS anxiety subscale score (p =0.008).\nTravel and contact history and association with psychological impact\nTravel and contact history and association with psychological impact (n=1879).\nTable 3	 	\nVariable	n (%)	Stress	Anxiety	Depression	Impact of event	 			Normal and Mild n (%)	At least Moderate n (%)	p-value*	Normal and Mild n (%)	At least Moderate n (%)	p-value*	Normal and Mild n (%)	At least Moderate n (%)	p-value*	Normal and Mild n (%)	At least Moderate n (%)	p-value*	 	Travel outside residential country in the past 14 days				0.131			0.667			0.911			0.148	 	Yes	31 (1.6)	24 (77.4)	7 (22.6)		21 (67.7)	10 (32.3)		26 (83.9)	5 (16.1)		23 (74.2)	8 (25.8)		 	No	1848 (98.4)	1603 (86.7)	245 (13.3)		1317 (71.3)	531 (28.7)		1536 (83.1)	312 (16.9)		1550 (83.9)	298 (16.1)		 	Direct or indirect contact with patients suffering from COVID-19				0.517			0.132			0.31			0.246	 	No	1678 (89.3)	1450 (86.4)	228 (13.6)		1204 (71.8)	474 (28.2)		1400 (83.4)	278 (16.6)		1399 (83.4)	279 (16.6)		 	Yes	201 (10.7)	177 (88.1)	24 (11.9)		134 (66.7)	67 (33.3)		162 (80.6)	39 (19.4)		174 (86.6)	27 (13.4)		 	Close contact with a confirmed case				0.553			0.574			0.044			0.956	 	No	1823 (97)	1580 (86.7)	243 (13.3)		1300 (71.3)	523 (28.7)		1521 (83.4)	302 (16.6)		1526 (83.7)	297 (16.3)		 	Yes	56 (3)	47 (83.9)	9 (16.1)		38 (67.9)	18 (32.1)		41 (73.2)	15 (26.8)		47 (83.9)	9 (16.1)		 	Indirect contact with a confirmed case				0.779			0.366			0.695			0.422	 	No	1775 (94.5)	1536 (86.5)	239 (13.5)		1268 (71.4)	507 (28.6)		1477 (83.2)	298 (16.8)		1483 (83.5)	292 (16.5)		 	Yes	104 (5.5)	91 (87.5)	13 (12.5)		70 (67.3)	34 (32.7)		85 (81.7)	19 (18.3)		90 (86.5)	14 (13.5)		 	Contact with a suspected case				0.797			0.172			0.737			0.922	 	No	1791 (95.3)	1550 (86.5)	241 (13.5)		1281 (71.5)	510 (28.5)		1490 (83.2)	301 (16.8)		1499 (83.7)	292 (16.3)		 	Yes	88 (4.7)	77 (87.5)	11 (12.5)		57 (64.8)	31 (35.2)		72 (81.8)	16 (18.2)		74 (84.1)	14 (15.9)		 	Contact with infected materials				0.246			0.273			0.120			0.888	 	No	1850 (98.5)	1604 (86.7)	246 (13.3)		1320 (71.4)	530 (28.6)		1541 (83.3)	309 (16.7)		1549 (83.7)	301 (16.3)		 	Yes	29 (1.5)	23 (79.3)	6 (20.7)		18 (62.1)	11 (37.9)		21 (72.4)	8 (27.6)		24 (82.8)	5 (17.2)		 	\nThe Chi-square statistic is significant at p&lt; 0.05 level.\nIn the two weeks prior to the survey, only 31 respondents (1.6%) had international travel history (Table 3 ).

0.05 level.\nThe proportions of respondents who perceive that the routes of transmission of the virus for COVID-19 were via droplets, via contaminated objects and airborne were 98.6%, 96.7% and 35.3%, respectively (Table 4 ). About 76.8% were satisfied to very satisfied with the amount of health information available. Almost all knew about current numbers of cases, deaths and recoveries from COVID-19. Information was mainly sourced from social media and internet by 77.9% of the respondents with an average of 0-9 hours screen time. Three-fourths of respondents had confidence in their own doctors' ability to recognize COVID-19. About 40.3% felt they will likely contract COVID-19 during the outbreak. There were 85% of respondents who felt they will likely survive if infected with COVID-19. On concerns about other family members getting COVID-19, 60.7% were very worried and 33.3% somewhat worried. Half of the respondents were somewhat to very worried about a child younger than 16 years old getting the illness.\nVery high satisfaction on the amount of health information available about COVID-19 was associated with low scores in IES-R, DASS stress subscale, DASS anxiety subscale and DASS depression subscale (p &lt;0.001). Dissatisfaction with available health information was associated with high anxiety level (p &lt;0.001). Those who have not heard about the number of recovered cases had significant high scores on DASS stress subscale (p =0.003), DASS anxiety subscale (p =0.005) and IES-R (p =0.002).\nThe proportion of those who primarily obtain their information through the social media and internet had high levels of anxiety (p &lt;0.001) and depression signals (p &lt;0.001). Those who had their family members as the main source of health information had high stress signals (p =0.045).\nHigh level of confidence in their own doctors' ability to diagnose COVID-19 was associated with low scores in DASS stress subscale (p =0.017), DASS anxiety subscale (p =0.001), DASS depression subscale (p =0.006) and IES-R (p =0.006) scores.\nThose who reported not likely contracting COVID-19 during the outbreak are either normal or have mild symptoms of stress (p =0.017), anxiety (p =0.001), and depression (p =0.035). The respondents who felt unlikely to survive a COVID-19 infection and who felt worried about family members getting COVID-19 had high scores on stress, anxiety and depression subscales and IES-R. Those who felt very worried about a child younger than 16 years old getting COVID-19 had a significantly high score for DASS anxiety subscale (p =0.005).\nMajority did not feel being discriminated against by other countries due to the outbreak. However, to those who felt discriminated against, they had significantly high scores for stress (p =0.001), anxiety (p &lt;0.001), depression (p =0.004) and IES-R (p &lt;0.001).\nPrecautionary

significant at p&lt; 0.05 level.\nThe majority practiced the precautionary measures against COVID-19 in the 14 days prior to responding to the survey as shown in Table 5 . Majority of the respondents stayed at home for 20-24 hours a day to avoid COVID-19. About 35.5% of respondents almost always felt that too much worry had been made about COVID-19.\nThe practice of washing hands after touching contaminated objects and the wearing of masks regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms were associated with low stress scores (p &lt;0.05). While the practice of always washing hands with soap and water was associated with both low stress (p =0.034) and anxiety (p =0.007) scores.\nThe long hours of staying at home (20-24 hours) was associated with high scores in the anxiety (p =0.026) and depression (p =0.005) subscales. Those who always felt that there was too much unnecessary worry about COVID-19 had high scores for IES-R (p &lt;0.001), and subscale scores for stress (p &lt;0.001), anxiety (p =0.002) and depression (p &lt;0.001).\nAdditional health information and association with psychological impact\nAdditional health information required and association with psychological impact (n=1879).\nTable 6	 	\nVariable	n (%)	Stress	Anxiety	Depression	Impact of event	 			Normal and Mild n (%)	At least Moderaten (%)	p-value*	Normal and Mild n (%)	At least Moderate n (%)	p-value*	Normal and Mild n (%)	At least Moderate n (%)	p-value*	Normal and Mild n (%)	At least Moderate n (%)	p-value*	 	Need for additional information about COVID-19				0.209			0.003			0.14			0.011	 	Yes	1316 (70)	1131 (85.9)	185 (14.1)		910 (69.1)	406 (30.9)		1083 (82.3)	233 (17.7)		1083 (82.3)	233 (17.7)		 	No	563 (30)	496 (88.1)	67 (11.9)		428 (76)	135 (24)		479 (85.1)	84 (14.9)		490 (87)	73 (13)		 	Need for details on symptoms of COVID-19 infection				0.153			0.002			0.065			0.005	 	No	672 (35.8)	592 (88.1)	80 (11.9)		508 (75.6)	164 (24.4)		573 (85.3)	99 (14.7)		584 (86.9)	88 (13.1)		 	Yes	1207 (64.2)	1035 (85.7)	172 (14.3)		830 (68.8)	377 (31.2)		989 (81.9)	218 (18.1)		989 (81.9)	218 (18.1)		 	Need on advice on prevention of COVID-19 infection				0.223			0.032			0.236			0.044	 	No	653 (34.8)	574 (87.9)	79 (12.1)		485 (74.3)	168 (25.7)		552 (84.5)	101 (15.5)		562 (86.1)	91 (13.9)		 	Yes	1226 (65.2)	1053 (85.9)	173 (14.1)		853 (69.6)	373 (30.4)		1010 (82.4)	216 (17.6)		1011 (82.5)	215 (17.5)		 	Need for advice on treatment of COVID-19				0.177			0.004			0.198			0.010	 	No	591 (31.5)	521 (88.2)	70 (11.8)		447 (75.6)	144 (24.4)		501 (84.8)	90 (15.2)		514 (87)	77 (13)		 	Yes	1288 (68.5)	1106 (85.9)	182 (14.1)		891 (69.2)	397 (30.8)		1061 (82.4)	227 (17.6)		1059 (82.2)	229 (17.8)		 	Need for regular updates for latest information about COVID-19 infection				0.292			0.014			0.177			0.050	 	No	606 (32.3)	532 (87.8)	74 (12.2)		454 (74.9)	152 (25.1)		514 (84.8)	92 (15.2)		522 (86.1)	84 (13.9)		 	Yes	1273 (67.7)	1095 (86)	178 (14)		884 (69.4)	389 (30.6)		1048 (82.3)	225 (17.7)		1051 (82.6)	222 (17.4)		 	Need for latest updates for outbreaks in the local area				0.338			0.013			0.376			0.017	 	No	639 (34)	560 (87.6)	79 (12.4)		478 (74.8)	161 (25.2)		538 (84.2)	101 (15.8)		553 (86.5)	86 (13.5)		 	Yes	1240 (66)	1067 (86)	173 (14)		860 (69.4)	380 (30.6)		1024 (82.6)	216 (17.4)		1020 (82.3)	220 (17.7)		 	Need for advice for people who may need more tailored information, such as those with pre-existing illness				0.433			0.004			0.203			0.018	 	No	645 (34.3)	564 (87.4)	81 (12.6)		486 (75.3)	159 (24.7)		546 (84.7)	99 (15.3)		558 (86.5)	87 (13.5)		 	Yes	1234 (65.7)	1063 (86.1)	171 (13.9)		852 (69)	382 (31)		1016 (82.3)	218 (17.7)		1015 (82.3)	219 (17.7)		 	Need for information on availability and effectiveness of medicine/vaccine for COVID-19 infection				0.254			0.002			0.148			0.013	 	No	580 (30.9)	510 (87.9)	70 (12.1)		441 (76)	139 (24)		493 (85)	87 (15)		504 (86.9)	76 (13.1)		 	Yes	1299 (69.1)	1117 (86)	182 (14)		897 (69.1)	402 (30.9)		1069 (82.3)	230 (17.7)		1069 (82.3)	230 (17.7)		 	Need for latest updates on the number of people infected by COVID-19 and their location				0.546			0.003			0.271			0.053	 	No	643 (34.2)	561 (87.2)	82 (12.8)		486 (75.6)	157 (24.4)		543 (84.4)	100 (15.6)		553 (86)	90 (14)		 	Yes	1236 (65.8)	1066 (86.2)	170 (13.8)		852 (68.9)	384 (31.1)		1019 (82.4)	217 (17.6)		1020 (82.5)	216 (17.5)		 	Need for travel advice				0.359			0.026			0.239			0.317	 	No	773 (41.1)	676 (87.5)	97 (12.5)		572 (74)	201 (26)		652 (84.3)	121 (15.7)		655 (84.7)	118 (15.3)		 	Yes	1106 (58.9)	951 (86)	155 (14)		766 (69.3)	340 (30.7)		910 (82.3)	196 (17.7)		918 (83)	188 (17)		 	Need for updates on the routes of transmission of COVID-19				0.341			0.003			0.119			0.019	 	No	707 (37.6)	619 (87.6)	88 (12.4)		532 (75.2)	175 (24.8)		600 (84.9)	107 (15.1)		610 (86.3)	97 (13.7)		 	Yes	1172 (62.4)	1008 (86)	164 (14)		806 (68.8)	366 (31.2)		962 (82.1)	210 (17.9)		963 (82.2)	209 (17.8)		 	Need for updates on how other countries handle the COVID-19 outbreak				0.136			0.006			0.105			0.07	 	No	637 (33.9)	562 (88.2)	75 (11.8)		479 (75.2)	158 (24.8)		542 (85.1)	95 (14.9)		547 (85.9)	90 (14.1)		 	Yes	1242 (66.1)	1065 (85.7)	177 (14.3)		859 (69.2)	383 (30.8)		1020 (82.1)	222 (17.9)		1026 (82.6)	216 (17.4)		 	\nThe Chi-square statistic is significant at p&lt; 0.05 level.\n Table 6 shows that 70% of respondents wanted additional health information about COVID-19. Those who wanted additional information, details on symptoms, advice on prevention and treatment, regular updates for latest information and for the outbreaks in their local area, advice for people who might need more tailored information, information on the availability and effectiveness of medicine/vaccine for COVID-19 and updates on the route of transmission of the virus were all associated with significantly high scores for DASS anxiety subscale and IES-R. Those who need latest updates on the number of people infected and their location, travel advice and updates on how other countries handle the outbreak were associated with significantly high anxiety scores (p &lt;0.05).\nDiscussion\nThis survey was conducted in the first month that COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and enhanced community quarantine was implemented in the Philippines. To our knowledge, this was the first study that examined the psychological impact of COVID-19 to the general population in the country. During this time, 16.3% of the respondents reported moderate to severe psychological impact; 16.9% of the respondents reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 13.4% reported moderate to severe stress signals. However, these levels were lower than the rates reported by which were 33.7%, 31.9% and 29.6% for depression, anxiety, and stress respectively. In China, the majority reported worse psychological impact with overall mean IES-R scores more than 24 points, indicating the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Different populations in the world have been experiencing pandemic fear which can worsen feelings of anxiety that can lead to mental health disorders. Previous experiences of outbreaks like those caused by SARS, Ebola, and MERS-CoV contribute to heightening the impact of the present pandemic.\nThe study shows that females are more affected than males. The less educated, single people, children and adolescents, those who have no children reported high levels of stress, anxiety, depression and psychological impact. These subgroups, considered at greater risk for adverse psychological outcomes during a public health crisis, may be experiencing low social and emotional support, increased perceived threat to well-being and feelings of fear, isolation and uncertainty.\nThe students reported greater psychological impact as well as more depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms compared to those who are employed. The results were comparable to reports among the Chinese students. Contributing factors include effects on daily life and routine, academic delays, and perhaps reduced social support.\nDuring pandemics, healthcare workers are at the front lines. They are subjected to long working hours, risk of infection, shortages of protective equipment, loneliness, exhaustion and separation from families. They are at a significant risk of adverse mental health outcomes. However, our study shows that HCPs had lower levels of psychological impact, and symptoms of stress and depression than non-HCPs, comparable to the survey done among health care workers in Singapore. This can be due to their strong sense of duty and ability to adapt to crisis. It can also be because the survey was done during the early parts of the pandemic when cases were still low and the health care system was not yet overwhelmed. As the pandemic ensues, mental health policies are needed to support our HCPs and other front-line workers.\nIn this study, most respondents rated their current health status as good. They feel that they are less likely to contract COVID-19 and more likely to survive the infection if they do get infected. They were also confident of their own doctors' abilities. These perceptions seemed to be protective against adverse mental health state. It was reported that almost half of the respondents had at least one physical symptom within the last two weeks, but only 5% had a recent visit with their doctors for consultation. This disparity between symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and health-seeking behavior may be due to factors like physical limitations caused by community quarantine, closed outpatient clinics, fear of getting infected in hospitals, and lack of public transportation. The presence of any of these symptoms and consequent imposed quarantine by a health authority was associated with psychological distress as also found among the Chinese population. In severe instances where presence of symptoms cause social discrimination and avoidance, or lack of basic needs cause hopelessness, the more vulnerable individuals commit suicide.\nIn the Philippines where universal health care is not yet fully implemented, the 60% of respondents who had medical health coverage had less anxiety symptoms as compared to those who had none. The government's health aid through the which assured to cover the full cost of COVID-19 hospitalization to its members may have had a positive effect on the public's mental health.\nDuring the initial phase of the lockdowns in the Philippines, majority of the respondents spent an average of 0-9 hours on social media to derive information and news. Those who had access and were satisfied to updated information experienced less psychological impact and lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression. Still many express the need for additional and up-to-date information. They were showing signs of anxiety and moderate psychological impact which may lead to &quot;headline stress disorder&quot;. Shared information that is relevant and unambiguous may alleviate panic and stress. A more consistent public education is needed to decrease uncertainties that are associated with more emotional reactions.\nIt appeared that those who practice hand hygiene and wear face masks as precautionary measures have protective effects on psychological status. Wearing a face mask is generally recognized to prevent a sick person from transmitting the virus while also protecting the wearer from getting infected. At the time of the survey, many establishments have imposed a &quot;no mask-no entry&quot; policy.\nThe restriction in social mobility to control the pandemic is stressful as it prevents face-to-face connections and traditional social interactions. Those who can go out like the workers who provide essential services exhibited less symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to those who stay 20 to 24 hours at home. Those who exhibit COVID-related symptoms or potential contacts of COVID were isolated and separated from loved ones. The imposed quarantine as seen in previous outbreaks has associated negative psychological effects that may be linked to fears of having the infection and spreading it to family members; frustration and boredom from being isolated; duration of uncertainty and scarcity of basic supplies. While isolation may be a necessary preventive measure, adequate information, opening lines of communication and provision of essential supplies to those confined may improve psychosocial outcomes.\nThe present study has some limitations. First, the survey was done online and administered in the English language. Majority of respondents were well educated with access to the internet. Second, the snowball sampling strategy was initiated within the social network of academicians and healthcare professionals and may not be representative of the general population. Third, the survey was rolled in the early phase of the pandemic and the psychological outcomes may change over the course of the public health crisis.\nConclusion\nDuring the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, one-fourth of the respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety, one-seventh reported moderate-to-severe stress levels and one-sixth reported moderate-to-severe depression and psychological impact of the outbreak. Female gender, youth age of 12-21 years, single status, students, presence of specific physical symptoms (i.e., headache, cough, chills), recent imposed quarantine by a health authority, prolonged stay at home, poor self-reported health status, feeling of too much unnecessary worry has been made about COVID-19, concerns about family members getting sick, and feeling of being discriminated by other countries were associated with a greater psychological impact of the pandemic and higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression. Timely and accurate health information, having children older than 16 years old, perception of good health status and confidence in their own health care providers were associated with lesser psychological impact of the pandemic and lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression. The findings of this study can be used to frame appropriate psychological interventions to avert occurrence of mental health problems preventing psychological crisis.\nFinancial disclosure\nNone.\nFunding\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n Michael L.

gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus.\n Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the COVID-19 and mass isolation were not available.\n To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people.\n An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province.\n Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures.\n Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio.\n Results also revealed that young people aged 21–40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use.\n To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.\ne.\n forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.\n).\n","id":"PMC7194662","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier B.V.","authors":[{"firstname":"Md

UK validation","abstract":"Background\nThere is increasing international interest in the concept of mental well-being and its contribution to all aspects of human life.\n\n Demand for instruments to monitor mental well-being at a population level and evaluate mental health promotion initiatives is growing.\n\n This article describes the development and validation of a new scale, comprised only of positively worded items relating to different aspects of positive mental health: the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS).\n\n\nMethods\nWEMWBS was developed by an expert panel drawing on current academic literature, qualitative research with focus groups, and psychometric testing of an existing scale.\n\n It was validated on a student and representative population sample.\n\n Content validity was assessed by reviewing the frequency of complete responses and the distribution of responses to each item.\n\n Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the hypothesis that the scale measured a single construct.\n\n Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha.\n\n Criterion validity was explored in terms of correlations between WEMWBS and other scales and by testing whether the scale discriminated between population groups in line with pre-specified hypotheses.\n\n Test-retest reliability was assessed at one week using intra-class correlation coefficients.\n\n Susceptibility to bias was measured using the Balanced Inventory of Desired Responding.\n\n\nResults\nWEMWBS showed good content validity.\n\n Confirmatory factor analysis supported the single factor hypothesis.\n\n A Cronbach's alpha score of 0.89 (student sample) and 0.91 (population sample) suggests some item redundancy in the scale.\n\n WEMWBS showed high correlations with other mental health and well-being scales and lower correlations with scales measuring overall health.\n\n Its distribution was near normal and the scale did not show ceiling effects in a population sample.\n\n It discriminated between population groups in a way that is largely consistent with the results of other population surveys.\n\n Test-retest reliability at one week was high (0.83).\n\n Social desirability bias was lower or similar to that of other comparable scales.\n\n\nConclusion\nWEMWBS is a measure of mental well-being focusing entirely on positive aspects of mental health.\n\n As a short and psychometrically robust scale, with no ceiling effects in a population sample, it offers promise as a tool for monitoring mental well-being at a population level.\n\n Whilst WEMWBS should appeal to those evaluating mental health promotion initiatives, it is important that the scale's sensitivity to change is established before it is recommended in this context.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2222612","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

outbreak in China","abstract":"Background\nWith its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n Consequently, many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China.\n\n China itself has imposed a lockdown of the population of Wuhan as well as the entire Hubei province.\n\n However, whether these two enormous measures have led to significant changes in the spread of COVID-19 cases remains unclear.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analyzed available data on the development of confirmed domestic and international COVID-19 cases before and after lockdown measures.\n\n We evaluated the correlation of domestic air traffic to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and determined the growth curves of COVID-19 cases within China before and after lockdown as well as after changes in COVID-19 diagnostic criteria.\n\n\nResults\nOur findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time from 2 days (95% Confidence Interval, CI): 1.9–2.6), to 4 days (95% CI: 3.5–4.3), after imposing lockdown.\n\n A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1–26.3), respectively.\n\n Moreover, the correlation between domestic air traffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r?=?0.98, p?&lt;?0.05 vs.\n\n after lockdown: r?=?0.91, p?=?NS).\n\n\nConclusions\nA significantly decreased growth rate and increased doubling time of cases was observed, which is most likely due to Chinese lockdown measures.\n\n A more stringent confinement of people in high risk areas seem to have a potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7184469","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

Virus Disease Outbreak","abstract":"id='Par1'>The 2013–2016 West Africa Ebola virus disease pandemic was the largest, longest, deadliest, and most geographically expansive outbreak in the 40-year interval since Ebola was first identified.\n Fear-related behaviors played an important role in shaping the outbreak.\n Fear-related behaviors are defined as “individual or collective behaviors and actions initiated in response to fear reactions that are triggered by a perceived threat or actual exposure to a potentially traumatizing event.\n FRBs modify the future risk of harm.\n” This review examines how fear-related behaviors were implicated in (1) accelerating the spread of Ebola, (2) impeding the utilization of life-saving Ebola treatment, (3) curtailing the availability of medical services for treatable conditions, (4) increasing the risks for new-onset psychological distress and psychiatric disorders, and (5) amplifying the downstream cascades of social problems.\n Fear-related behaviors are identified for each of these outcomes.\n Particularly notable are behaviors such as treating Ebola patients in home or private clinic settings, the “laying of hands” on Ebola-infected individuals to perform faith-based healing, observing hands-on funeral and burial customs, foregoing available life-saving treatment, and stigmatizing Ebola survivors and health professionals.\n Future directions include modeling the onset, operation, and perpetuation of fear-related behaviors and devising strategies to redirect behavioral responses to mass threats in a manner that reduces risks and promotes resilience.\n","id":"PMC5241909","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer US","authors":[{"firstname":"James

Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population in China","abstract":"Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience.\n Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic.\n The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n The data will be used for future reference.\n Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques.\n The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The impact of epidemic, war, prohibition and media on suicide: United States,1910-1920","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30090-0","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Patients with mental health disorders in the COVID-19 epidemic","abstract":"","id":"PMC7269717","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Hao","surname":"Yao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-Feng","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102066","date":"2020-03-31","title":"COVID-19 and mental health: A review of the existing literature","abstract":"\n\n\n•\nSubsyndromal mental health concerns are a common response to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n","id":"PMC7151415","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier B.V.","authors":[{"firstname":"Ravi Philip","surname":"Rajkumar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1177/1359105320951620","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A systematic review of the prevalence of anxiety symptoms during coronavirus epidemics","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Loades ME, Chatburn E, Higson-Sweeney N, Reynolds S, Shafran R, Brigden A, et al.

Second, are these behavior and mental health changes associated with the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media?\nMethods\nBehaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife smartphone sensing app.\n\n Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students, with 178 (82.0%) students providing data during the Winter 2020 term.\n\n Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term compared to previous terms in the same cohort were modeled using mixed linear models.\n\n\nResults\nDuring the first academic term impacted by COVID-19 (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P&lt;.\n\n001) relative to previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks.\n\n Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and the week of the academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant.\n\n In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term were strongly associated with increased amount of COVID-19–related news.\n\n When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P&lt;.\n\n001) and depression (P=.\n\n03) were significantly associated with COVID-19–related news.\n\n\nConclusions\nCompared with prior academic terms, individuals in the Winter 2020 term were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed.\n\n A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, were associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting.\n\n While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods to reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7301687","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR

months and years to come.\n Studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression, and insomnia in the general population and among health care professionals.\n Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress, and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable populations including individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and people who reside in high COVID-19 prevalence areas.\n Stress-related psychiatric conditions including mood and substance use disorders are associated with suicidal behavior.\n COVID-19 survivors may also be at elevated suicide risk.\n The COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide rates during and after the pandemic.\n Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis including suicidal behavior are likely to be present for a long time and peak later than the actual pandemic.\n To reduce suicides during the COVID-19 crisis it is imperative to decrease stress, anxiety, fears and loneliness in the general population.\n There should be traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress.\n Active outreach is necessary, especially for people with a history of psychiatric disorders, COVID-19 survivors, and older adults.\n Research

Our internet searches were restricted to countries with more than 3 million residents for pragmatic reasons, but we relaxed this rule for countries identified through the literature and our networks.\n\n Areas within countries could also be included with populations of less than 3 million.\n\n We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from at least Jan 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020) in each country or area within a country, comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number of suicides in the early months of the pandemic (from April 1 to July 31, 2020, in the primary analysis).\n\n\nFindings\nWe sourced data from 21 countries (16 high-income and five upper-middle-income countries), including whole-country data in ten countries and data for various areas in 11 countries).\n\n Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs based on the observed versus expected numbers of suicides showed no evidence of a significant increase in risk of suicide since the pandemic began in any country or area.\n\n There was statistical evidence of a decrease in suicide compared with the expected number in 12 countries or areas: New South Wales, Australia (RR 0·81 [95% CI 0·72–0·91]); Alberta, Canada (0·80 [0·68–0·93]); British Columbia, Canada (0·76 [0·66–0·87]); Chile (0·85 [0·78–0·94]); Leipzig, Germany (0·49 [0·32–0·74]); Japan (0·94 [0·91–0·96]); New Zealand (0·79 [0·68–0·91]); South Korea (0·94 [0·92–0·97]); California, USA (0·90 [0·85–0·95]); Illinois (Cook County), USA (0·79 [0·67–0·93]); Texas (four counties), USA (0·82 [0·68–0·98]); and Ecuador (0·74 [0·67–0·82]).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis is the first study to examine suicides occurring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries.\n\n In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, suicide numbers have remained largely unchanged or declined in the early months of the pandemic compared with the

Four hundred and twenty five people developed clinical symptoms in three geographically distinct parts of the country (Gulu, Masindi, and Mbarara), of whom 224 (53%) died.\n\n Given the focus of previous social scientific Ebola research on experiences in communities that have been directly affected, this article expands the lens to include responses to the outbreak in local, national, and international contexts over the course of the outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nResponses to the outbreak were gauged through the articles, editorials, cartoons, and letters that were published in the country’s two main English language daily national newspapers: the New Vision and the Monitor (now the Daily Monitor).\n\n All the relevant pieces from these two sources over the course of the epidemic were cut out, entered onto a computer, and the originals filed.\n\n The three a priori codes, based on the local, national, and international levels, were expanded into six, to include issues that emerged inductively during analysis.\n\n The data within each code were subsequently worked into coherent, chronological narratives.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 639 cuttings were included in the analysis.\n\n Strong and varied responses to the outbreak were identified from across the globe.\n\n These included, among others: confusion, anger, and serious stigma in affected communities; medical staff working themselves to exhaustion, with some quitting their posts; patients fleeing from hospitals; calls on spiritual forces for protection against infection; a well-coordinated national control strategy; and the imposition of some international travel restrictions.\n\n Responses varied both quantitatively and qualitatively according to the level (i.\n\ne.\n\n local, national, or international) at which they were manifested.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe Ugandan experience of 2000/2001 demonstrates that responses to an Ebola outbreak can be very dramatic, but perhaps disproportionate to the actual danger presented.\n\n An important objective for any future outbreak control strategy must be to prevent excessive fear, which, it is expected, would reduce stigma and other negative outcomes.\n\n To this end, the value of openness in the provision of public information, and critically, of being seen to be open, cannot be overstated.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3477054","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"John","surname":"Kinsman","email":"john.kinsman@epiph.umu.se","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMp1409859","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ebola virus disease in West Africa:no early end to the outbreak","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMp1411244","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ebola in a stew of fear","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/WTF.0000000000000079","date":"1970-01-01","title":"An outbreak of fear, rumours and stigma: psychosocial support for the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Behavioural and emotional responses to the 2014 Ebola Outbreak in Nigeria: a narrative review","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0129179","date":"2015-05-05","title":"Mass Media and the Contagion of Fear: The Case of Ebola in America","abstract":"Background\nIn the weeks following the first imported case of Ebola in the U.\n\n S.\n\n on September 29, 2014, coverage of the very limited outbreak dominated the news media, in a manner quite disproportionate to the actual threat to national public health; by the end of October, 2014, there were only four laboratory confirmed cases of Ebola in the entire nation.\n\n Public interest in these events was high, as reflected in the millions of Ebola-related Internet searches and tweets performed in the month following the first confirmed case.\n\n Use of trending Internet searches and tweets has been proposed in the past for real-time prediction of outbreaks (a field referred to as “digital epidemiology”), but accounting for the biases of public panic has been problematic.\n\n In the case of the limited U.\n\n S.\n\n Ebola outbreak, we know that the Ebola-related searches and tweets originating the U.\n\n S.\n\n during the outbreak were due only to public interest or panic, providing an unprecedented means to determine how these dynamics affect such data, and how news media may be driving these trends.\n\n\nMethodology\nWe examine daily Ebola-related Internet search and Twitter data in the U.\n\n S.\n\n during the six week period ending Oct 31, 2014.

Thematic analysis approach was applied to analyze the data.\n\n\nResults\nThe main stressors inside the ETU were the daily exposure to corpses, which often remained several hours among the living; the patients’ isolation from their families and worries about their well-being; and sometimes, the perception of disrespect by ETU staff.\n\n However, most survivors reported how staff motivated patients to drink, eat, bathe, and walk.\n\n Additionally, employing survivors as staff fostered hope, calling patients by their name increased confidence and familiarity, and organizing prayer and singing activities brought comfort.\n\n When Ebola virus disease survivors returned home, the experience of being alive was both a gift and a burden.\n\n Flashbacks were common among survivors.\n\n Perceived as contagious, many were excluded from their family, professional, and social life.\n\n Some survivors faced divorce, were driven out of their houses, or lost their jobs.\n\n The subsequent isolation prevented survivors from picking up daily life, and the multiple losses affected their coping mechanisms.\n\n However, when available, the support of family, friends, and prayer enabled survivors to cope with their mental distress.\n\n For those excluded from society, psychosocial counseling and the survivor’s network were ways to give a meaning to life post-Ebola.\n\n\nConclusion\nExposure to death in the ETU and stigma in the communities induced posttraumatic stress reactions and symptoms of depression among Ebola survivors.\n\n Distress in the ETU can be reduced through timely management of corpses.\n\n Coping mechanisms can be strengthened through trust relationships, religion, peer/community support, and community-based psychosocial care.\n\n Mental health disorders need to be addressed with appropriate specialized care and follow-up.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4931229","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Ionara","surname":"Rabelo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Virginia","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mosoka P.","surname":"Fallah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Moses","surname":"Massaquoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Iro","surname":"Evlampidou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rosa","surname":"Crestani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Decroo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rafael","surname":"Van den Bergh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Severy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s11673-014-9581-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ebola, ethics, and the question of culture","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid2104.141940","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evolution of Ebola Virus Disease from Exotic Infection to Global Health Priority, Liberia, Mid-2014","abstract":"As the disease spread, the scale of the epidemic required a multi-faceted public health response.\n","id":"PMC4378496","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","authors":[{"firstname":"M.

Surveys were completed by 3426 employees (18.4%), approximately one third of whom were health professionals.\n\n\nResults\nDemographic and professional distribution of respondents was similar to all hospital staff.\n\n Overall, more than one-in-four (28%) hospital workers indicated they were not willing to respond to an influenza pandemic scenario if asked but not required to do so.\n\n Only an additional 10% were willing if required.\n\n One-third (32%) of participants reported they would be unwilling to respond in the event of a more severe pandemic influenza scenario.\n\n These response rates were consistent across different departments, and were one-third lower among nurses as compared with physicians.\n\n Respondents who were hesitant to agree to work additional hours when required were 17 times less likely to respond during a pandemic if asked.\n\n Sixty percent of the workers perceived their peers as likely to report to work in such an emergency, and were ten times more likely

to Respond to Pandemic Influenza Using a Threat- and Efficacy-Based Assessment Framework","abstract":"Background\nEmergency Medical Services workers' willingness to report to duty in an influenza pandemic is essential to healthcare system surge amidst a global threat.\n\n Application of Witte's Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) has shown utility for revealing influences of perceived threat and efficacy on non-EMS public health providers' willingness to respond in an influenza pandemic.\n\n We thus propose using an EPPM-informed assessment of EMS workers' perspectives toward fulfilling their influenza pandemic response roles.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe administered an EPPM-informed snapshot survey about attitudes and beliefs toward pandemic influenza response, to a nationally representative, stratified random sample of 1,537 U.\n\nS.\n\n EMS workers from May–June 2009 (overall response rate: 49%).\n\n Of the 586 respondents who met inclusion criteria (currently active EMS providers in primarily EMS response roles), 12% indicated they would not voluntarily report to duty in a pandemic influenza emergency if asked, 7% if required.\n\n A majority (52%) indicated their unwillingness to report to work if risk of disease transmission to family existed.\n\n Confidence in personal safety at work (OR?=?3.3) and a high threat/high efficacy (“concerned and confident”) EPPM profile (OR?=?4.7) distinguished those who were more likely to voluntarily report to duty.\n\n Although 96% of EMS workers indicated that they would probably or definitely report to work if they were guaranteed a pandemic influenza vaccine, only 59% had received an influenza immunization in the preceding 12 months.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nEMS workers' response willingness gaps pose a substantial challenge to prehospital surge capacity in an influenza pandemic.\n\n “Concerned and confident” EMS workers are more than four times as likely to fulfill pandemic influenza response expectations.\n\n Confidence in workplace safety is a positively influential modifier of their response willingness.\n\n These findings can inform insights into interventions for enhancing EMS workers' willingness to respond in the face of a global infectious disease threat.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2844432","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience.\n Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic.\n The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n The data will be used for future reference.\n Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques.\n The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern","abstract":"","id":"PMC7135038","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"cyh-birm@263.net","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter W","surname":"Horby","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick G","surname":"Hayden","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1007.030703","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS Control and Psychological Effects of Quarantine, Toronto, Canada","abstract":"Explores effects of quarantine on those quarantined for SARS, Toronto, Canada","id":"PMC3323345","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Hawryluck","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wayne L.","surname":"Gold","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Robinson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Pogorski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sandro","surname":"Galea","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rima","surname":"Styra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/jcm9020330","date":"2020-01-23","title":"The Extent of Transmission of Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, 2020","abstract":"A cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported by China in late December 2019.

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth.\n The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation.\n We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0.\n Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.\n The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403–540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18–25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.\n We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49–2.63).\n Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.\n","id":"PMC7074332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Shi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinjun","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangpu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daozhou","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

next lethal viral epidemic that occurs.\n\n\nMethod\nThe 1995 Kikwit Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formally Zaire) is one of the most well studied epidemics to have occurred to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nWhen an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered.\n\n Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities.\n\n The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral lessons from the outbreak include the importance of having simple, well-defined triage procedures; staff who are flexible and able to adapt to situations with unknowns; and the need to protect staff physically and emotionally to ensure a sustained effort to provide care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7132410","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Ryan

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities.\n At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down.\n It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities.\n Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma.\n The severity of this epidemic and its long-lasting repercussions should spur investment in and development of health systems.\n","id":"PMC4773931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"World Health

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire.\n\n Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access.\n\n\nIn addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6).\n\n The total Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n The perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level and the number of physical symptoms were associated with higher IES-R Score (P&lt;.\n\n05).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis is one of the first few studies demonstrating the use of Internet in data collection during an air-pollution crisis.\n\n Our results demonstrated that the newer technological modalities have the potential to acquire data, similar to that of conventional technologies.\n\n Demographic variables did not influence the mechanism of usage.\n\n In addition, our findings also suggested that there are acute physical and psychological impacts on the population

In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak.\n An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China.\n A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants.\n The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days.\n Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor.\n The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%.\n The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days.\n In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P&lt;0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019. Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for Chinese residents to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices.\n Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to populations of a low socioeconomic status.\n","id":"PMC7098034","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Ivyspring International Publisher","authors":[{"firstname":"Bao-Liang","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hai-Mei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qian-Qian","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Ge","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-Tian","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World Health Organization, 2020.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui
