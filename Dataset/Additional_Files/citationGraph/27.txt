Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.\nSince December 2019, a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19) has been reported. The outbreak originated in Wuhan before spreading throughout China and the rest of the world. COVID-19 is a contagious pulmonary infectious disease with respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in the previously reported SARS epidemic in 2003. Respiratory droplets and close contact transmission are the main routes of transmission. There is also a possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment when exposed to high concentrations of aerosol for a protracted period of time. Parturients have relatively depressed immunity and could theoretically be at higher risk from infection of this virus. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 virus infection during pregnancy is reported to be a serious threat to pregnant women and their fetuses. Nevertheless, the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2-infected parturients and their babies remains unknown.\nAs of January 2020, the Renmin hospital of Wuhan University has been designated as the diagnostic and treatment centre for pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we retrospectively review 17 cases of the SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women who underwent Cesarean delivery.\nMethods\nPatients and diagnosis\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Renmin hospital of Wuhan University (No. WDRY2020-K077, 2 Feb 2020). Cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Renmin hospital of Wuhan University from 30 January to 23 February 2020 were reviewed. After obtaining written informed consent, all clinical data were independently collected by two investigators. The diagnosis of COVID-19 followed the diagnostic criteria established by the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (sixth edition) issued by the National Health Commission of China. Nasal swab samples from high-risk pregnant women and their newborns were tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus using a kit (BioGerm, Shanghai, China) according to the World Health Organization guidelines for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (also recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing, China). Chest computed tomography (CT) scans of all infected pregnant women were performed and reviewed as part of their pre-partum assessment. These scans were reviewed for the usual characteristic signs of COVID-19, including peripheral and/or sub-pleural ground-glass opacities.\nOperating room preparation, personnel entry and exit procedures, and medical staff protection\nAppropriate personnel protection equipment (PPE) was used in different zones of the operation room. Biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) protective medical equipment was worn during the operation, including N95 masks, goggles, protective suits, disposable medical caps, and medical rubber gloves. For care of the patients who received general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, the anesthesiologist used a powered air-purifying respirator.\nParturients were transferred between the isolation ward and the operating room by a negative pressure isolation transfer cabin that can carry one patient over a short distance in a stretcher and stretcher vehicle, and were transported by staff wearing BSL-3 protective medical equipment. The parturients also wore regular surgical masks throughout the process to reduce viral spread.\nOverall layout design of surgical workspaces\nStandard operating procedures for dressing biosafety level 3 protective medical equipment\nStandard operating procedures for undressing biosafety level 3 grade protective wear\nNegative pressure operating rooms were used for Cesarean delivery of parturients with COVID-19. Medical personnel entered and exited the operating room in strict accordance with the principles of clean area, contaminated pollution area, and two buffer zones (Fig. 1). Designated nurses ensured the implementation of standard procedures (Figs 2 and 3).\nAfter the surgery, the anesthesia workstation was disinfected for two hours with an anesthesia circuit sterilizer (containing 12% hydrogen peroxide). Chlorine-containing disinfectant (2,000 mg L-1) was used to clean the operating room floor and wipe the surface of reusable medical equipment (including the anesthesia workstation and monitors). Reusable medical devices (including surgical instruments) were soaked for 30 min in 2,000 mg L-1 chlorine-containing disinfectant, then sealed and collected into double-layer disposable medical waste bags in the cleaning room and sent to the designated disinfection department by specialized staff. After the operating room was cleaned, the air purification system was shut down after 30 min of continuous operation of negative pressure laminar flow. Then, an ultra-low volume of 3% hydrogen peroxide (20-30 mL m-3) was used to closed fumigate the operating room for two hours. Finally, the negative pressure ventilation of the operating room was turned on again.\nAnesthesia, surgery, and perioperative management\nThe anesthesia informed consent was signed by the patient or her relative in the isolation ward or operating room to avoid the possibility of virus spread.\nRoutine monitoring (continuous non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiograph, and pulse oximetry) was performed after the patient entered the operating room. Continuous epidural anesthesia or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSE) was the first choice to avoid endotracheal intubation (which could induce or exacerbate pulmonary complications in parturients with COVID-19). General anesthesia was an option for cases of maternal or fetal emergencies, or for those patients with contraindications to epidural or CSE techniques, or if intrathecal anesthesia failed.\nConduct of epidural anesthesia\nThe L3-4 or L2-3 interspace was selected as the epidural puncture site. 2% lidocaine was used as both the test dose and loading dose; 0.75% ropivacaine was used for maintenance of epidural anesthesia. A sensory and motor block plane from T6-T8 segments to S4-5 was maintained during Cesarean delivery.\nConduct of general anesthesia\nFor cases needing general anesthetic for Cesarean delivery, preoxygenation was rapidly accomplished with four maximal capacity breaths with 100% oxygen. Rapid inhalation induction of general anesthesia consisted of 8% sevoflurane in 100% oxygen while cricoid pressure was continuously applied, and following two to three minutes of gentle positive pressure ventilation. This was followed by intravenous injections of 2% lidocaine (1-1.5 mg kg-1), remifentanil (1-2 mg kg-1) and succinylcholine choline (1-2 mg kg-1) to ensure optimal intubating conditions. Sevoflurane was used to maintain anesthesia before delivery, with sufentanil (0.25-0.35 mug kg-1) and an infusion of propofol (50-100 mug kg1 min-1) used to maintain anesthesia after delivery.\nOutcomes of both mothers and newborns\nAll parturients presenting to hospital were queried as to whether they had a history of exposure to, or were diagnosed with COVID-19 within the prior 14 days. The method of delivery, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score, arterial blood gases, operation time, estimated blood loss, postoperative visual analogue score (VAS) for pain, any need for analgesia within the first 48 postpartum hours, as well as maternal complications and outcomes were also recorded.\nAfter delivery, the newborns' oral cavity, nose, and face were wiped and cleaned immediately with a sterile towel. The newborns were then transferred to a radiant warmer bed in a cordoned-off area in the operating room. The Apgar score was assessed at one, five, and ten minutes after delivery. After ligation of the umbilical cord, newborns were sent to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by specialized nurses and no further contact with infected mothers was allowed. A blood gas from the newborn was measured in NICU. A SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR viral test (nasal swab) for neonates was performed twice, first on the day after delivery and then again on the day before discharged. Neonatal mortality, severe asphyxia, NICU length of stay, and other clinical outcomes were also recorded.\nPostoperative evaluation of medical staff\nAll medical staff who were involved in the Cesarean delivery were required to have a SARS-CoV-2 virus detection test (RT-PCR of nasal swabs) and CT scans once every two weeks.\nData presentation\nData were presented as mean (standard deviation), median [interquartile range], or n (%). As the overall number of cases was relatively small, no inferential statistical analysis was undertaken.\nResults\nDemographic data\nDemographic data (n = 17)\n	Epidural anesthesia (n = 14)	General anesthesia (n = 3)	 	Age, yr	29.5 (3.1)	28.7 (1.6)	 	Height, cm	160.3 (2.4)	161.0 (1.7)	 	Weight, kg	65.6 (3.4)	65.7 (2.89)	 	Gestational age			 	 &lt; 37 weeks, n (%)	3 (21)	0	 	 &gt;= 37 weeks, n (%)	11 (79)	3 (100)	 	Coexisting disorders	8 (57)	0	 	 Anemia, n (%)	5 (36)	0	 	 Hypertension, n (%)	1 (7)	0	 	 Diabetes, n (%)	2 (14)	0	 	\nData are presented as mean (standard deviation) or n (%), as indicated\nAnemia is defined as hemoglobin level of &lt; 11 g L-1; Hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg (average of at least two measurements taken at least 15 min apart); Diabetes is defined as fasting blood glucose concentration &gt; 7.0 mmol L-1 or two-hour blood glucose concentration &gt; 11.1 mmol L-1\n\nSeventeen parturients with COVID-19 were included in this study.

Two of them were doctors who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, while one patient's husband worked at the HUANAN Seafood Wholesale Market (once considered to be the source of the COVID-19 outbreak). Four patients (24%) presented with a mild fever without chills and none had a high fever (temperature &gt; 39  C). Other symptoms included four patients (24%) with cough, one (6%) with fatigue, two (12%) with &quot;chest distress&quot;, one (6%) with overt dyspnea, and one (6%) with diarrhea (Table 2).\nFive parturients (29%) with COVID-19 had lymphopenia (&lt; 1.0 cells x 109 L-1). Seven patients (41%) had elevated concentrations of C-reactive protein (&gt; 10 mg L-1). All patients had a normal level of alanine transaminase, aspartic transaminase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine (Table 2). All 17 patients tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and presented with multiple patchy ground-glass opacities on chest CT scan.\nAnesthesia management and surgery\nAnesthesia management and surgery (n = 17)\n	Epidural anesthesia (n = 14)	General anesthesia (n = 3)	 	Method of delivery			 	 Elective Cesarean delivery, n (%)	14 (100)	0	 	 Emergency Cesarean delivery, n (%)	0	3 (100)	 	ASA physical status			 	  I, n (%)	0	0	 	  II, n (%)	13 (93)	3 (100)	 	  III, n (%)	1(7)	0	 	  IV, n (%)	0	0	 	  V, n (%)	0	0	 	Arterial blood gas analysis			 	 pH	7.36 (0.03)	7.33 (0.02)	 	 PaO2, mmHg	117 (98)	125 (92)	 	 PaCO2, mmHg	32 (3)	27 (4)	 	 HCO3, mmol L-1	18.9 (1.5)	20.4 (0.4)	 	 BE, mmol L-1	-5.4 (1.7)	-3.5 (0.7)	 	 K+, mmol L-1	4.0 (0.3)	4.1 (0.1)	 	 Na+, mmol L-1	135 (4)	136.0 (0)	 	 Glu, mmol L-1	7.1 (1.8)	6.3 (0.2)	 	 Hb, g L-1	116.1 (13.1)	118.3 (0.6)	 	Duration of operation, min	68 (13)	80 (20)	 	Blood loss, mL	307 (92)	300 (100)	 	Postoperative VAS	2 [1-4]	3 [2-4]	 	Occurrence of complications			 	 Hypotension, n (%)	12 (86)	0	 	Post-Cesarean delivery length of stay, day	10 (4)	8 (3)	 	Clinical outcomes			 	 Discharge from hospital, n (%)	12 (86)	2 (67)	 	 Recovered, n (%)	12 (86)	2 (67)	 	\nData are presented as mean (standard deviation), median [interquartile range], or n (%) as indicated.

Three patients (18%) received general anesthesia (with endotracheal intubation) and the other 14 patients (82%) received continuous epidural anesthesia. An overview of the intraoperative arterial blood gas of the parturients is shown in Table 3. Twelve of the parturients (86%) undergoing epidural anesthesia experienced a higher rate of intraoperative hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt; 80% of baseline) than that in the general anesthesia group. Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters were not improved by left-lateral position, intravenous liquid loading, and/or vasoconstrictor treatment. There were no other apparent clinical differences in other measurements between the general and epidural anesthesia groups. Fourteen patients quickly recovered from COVID-19 and were discharged from hospital after six to 13 days in the hospital. The three patients remaining are still in the hospital as of 1 March 2020 recovering from their Cesarean delivery and COVID-19.\nNeonatal outcomes\nNeonatal outcomes (n = 17)\n	Epidural anesthesia (n = 14)	General anesthesia (n = 3)	 	Neonatal death, n (%)	0	0	 	Severe neonatal asphyxia, n (%)	0	0	 	Apgar score			 	 1 min	9 [8-9]	9 [7-9]	 	 5 min	10 [9-10]	10 [9-10]	 	 10 min	10 [9-10]	10 [9-10]	 	Birth weight, g	3,280 (330)	2,780 (180)	 	Low-birth weight (&lt; 2,500 g), n (%)	0	0	 	Neonatal acidosis (umbilical artery pH &lt; 7.2), n (%)	0	0	 	Arterial blood gas			 	 pH	7.36 (0.06)	7.35 (0.05)	 	 PaO2, mmHg	69 (16)	77 (3)	 	 PaCO2, mmHg	35 (7)	40 (4)	 	 HCO3, mmol L-1	19.9 (2.2)	21.2 (0. 5)	 	 Hb, g L-1	182.1 (8.2)	171.7 (11.6)	 	SARS-CoV-2 positive, n (%)	0	0	 	Duration of neonate ICU, hr	13 (6)	16 (2)	 	Clinical outcomes			 	 Discharge from hospital, n (%)	14 (100)	3 (100)	 	In the hospital, n (%)	0	0	 	\nData are presented as mean (standard deviation), median [interquartile range], or n (%) as indicated\nBE = base excess; Glu = glucose; Hb = hemoglobin; ICU = intensive care unit; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\nAll mothers had a singleton pregnancy. No intrapartum death, neonatal death, or serious neonatal asphyxia was observed. Three neonates were born prematurely, but none had a birthweight &lt; 2,500 g (Table 4). The Apgar scores ranged from 7 to 9 at one minute and 9 to 10 at five minutes (Table 4). All neonates were admitted to the NICU for further care and all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were negative. All 17 neonates were eventually discharged from hospital. There were no apparent differences in any parameters of the neonates when comparing the epidural anesthesia group with the general anesthesia group.\nPost-evaluation of medical staff infection\nA total of 12 obstetricians, ten anesthesiologists, and 26 nurses were involved in the Cesarean deliveries. All medical staff used BSL-3 protective equipment during the operation. Thus far, none have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 according to the RT-PCR testing and CT scan findings.\nDiscussion\nHerein we report 17 cases of parturients with COVID-19 having Cesarean delivery. All those patients presented with ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Epidural or general anesthesia was safe and effective for surgical patients. Careful patient transfer along with medical staff effective biosafety precautions were likely important to protect medical staff from SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nClinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection share some similarity with previous reports of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) infections. Most of those patients present with fever, dry cough, dyspnea, along with bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT scan, and patients with severe illness rapidly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required intensive care unit admission. Nevertheless, COVID-19 patients rarely developed gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, whereas about 20-25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection had diarrhea. In our experience, the 17 parturients with COVID-19 showed non-classical clinical characteristics. There were only two cases with chest distress and only one case with dyspnea. Nevertheless, none were hypoxemic or required supplemental oxygen prior to the operation. Nine of the parturients did not have typical symptoms such as fever and cough; instead they only showed abnormalities on the chest CT scan. These nine patients had only mild symptoms or were asymptomatic.\nIn this report, the proportion of maternal critical illness appeared much lower than the average proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan. One of the reasons may be that patients had a reduced range of activity and had less chance of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during late pregnancy. Two recent studies have also shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been detected in amniotic fluid, cord blood, or breast milk of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. This may explain why all the neonates in this study were free from infection. Our result is also consistent with the observation that the incidence of disease and disease severity were lower in neonates than in adults during the SARS epidemic, which may be related to the difficulty of vertical transmission of coronavirus, proper handling at birth, and timely isolation of the neonate after birth. A recent study showed that in addition to the lung, SARS-CoV-2 targets other organs such as kidney and testicles. It cannot be ruled out that SARS-CoV-2 may have an impact on the placenta. Thus, to ensure the safety of the parturients and newborns, we chose to perform elective Cesarean delivery.\nAlthough we recommend elective Cesarean delivery, there is a paucity of data to drive these recommendations. The final choice for the delivery method needs to consider the parturient's condition, the wishes of the parturient, and the advice of the obstetrician. The potential for transfer of the virus to the fetus during vaginal delivery is not known. If there is intrauterine fetal distress caused by hypoxia and other reasons, emergency Cesarean delivery should be performed immediately. In this study, three parturients underwent emergency Cesarean delivery because of fetal stress.\nAlthough no adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes were observed, COVID-19 can cause quick deterioration of lung function, so the ideal timing of Cesarean delivery is still crucial to ensuring maternal and fetal safety. Although both neuraxial and general anesthesia have been safely reported in pregnancy, because the lung is the main target organ of the virus, the choice of anesthetic regimens for Cesarean delivery is critical for pregnant women with COVID-19. Therefore, we recommend that neuraxial anesthesia wherever possible, based on it reducing the possibility of exacerbating pulmonary complications due to intubation. In our study, 14 of 17 pregnant women underwent epidural anesthesia, the onset time of sensory and motor block, the degree of motor block, the height of sensation, and the quality of anesthesia appeared to be the same as those of non-infected pregnant women. Nevertheless, it was noted that 86% of parturients undergoing epidural anesthesia experienced intraoperative hypotension. Importantly, because of the short duration and the hemodynamic changes, no adverse end-organ damage was apparent. As for why there appeared to be significant hypotension, a recent study suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can bind with the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor. The key of SARS-CoV-2 infection is its S protein binding with ACE2 receptor. These studies imply that the circulatory system is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. General anesthesia was used in three of our SARS-CoV-2-infected parturients. General anesthesia did not have any adverse effects on the neonatal outcomes and mothers' recovery from COVID-19.\nSARS-CoV-2 is easily spread from person to person via various routes. Respiratory droplets and close contact transmission are the main routes of transmission. There is a possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment when exposed to high concentrations of aerosol for a long time. To solve the safety issues such as environmental pollution and infection of medical staff with COVID-19, all medical staff involved in the operation need to be identified. They should be trained in proper infection control management procedures and have a thorough understanding of nosocomial infection control and risk factors for COVID-19. In this series of patients, no medical staff involved in the operation were infected with COVID-19. Several factors may have influenced this positive result. First, a specific patient negative pressure transfer vehicle and a dedicated negative pressure operating room were used to prevent the spread of the virus, and sterilization was performed after surgery. Second, patients and medical staff followed the established biosafety procedures when entering and leaving the operating room. Dedicated personnel wore protective equipment and infection control in the negative pressure anterior chamber and buffer room to improve efficiency. Third, parturients wore a surgical mask in case they coughed during tracheal intubation, and suctioning reduced the spread of respiratory droplets and aerosols.\nIn summary, our experience is that both epidural and general anesthesia are safe and effective for pregnant women and newborns. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension appeared to be significantly higher than normal during epidural anesthesia. A negative pressure operating room, proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions were also important to protect the medical staff from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This experience may be helpful in planning for further obstetric anesthetic management of COVID-19 patients, particularly if the infection progresses to pandemic status. \nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nRong Chen and Yuan Zhang have contributed equally to this work.\nZhong-yuan Xia and Qing-tao Meng share senior authorship.\nReferences\nClinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study\nClinical findings in a group of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) outside of Wuhan, China: retrospective case series\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nPractical recommendations for critical care and anesthesiology teams caring for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) patients\nChest computed tomography images of early coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\nA major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong\nEpidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study\nClinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China\nClinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records\nVertical transmission of human coronavirus.

survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant

occur primarily by either contact or large respiratory droplet transmission.\n However, infrequent healthcare worker infections occurred despite the use of contact and droplet precautions, particularly during certain aerosol-generating medical procedures.\n We investigated a possible cluster of SARS-CoV infections in healthcare workers who used contact and droplet precautions during attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a SARS patient.\n Unlike previously reported instances of transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, the index case-patient was unresponsive, and the intubation procedure was performed quickly and without difficulty.\n However, before intubation, the patient was ventilated with a bag-valve-mask that may have contributed to aerosolization of SARS-CoV.\n On the basis of the results of this investigation and previous reports of SARS transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, a systematic approach to the problem is outlined, including the use of the following: 1) administrative controls, 2) environmental engineering controls, 3) personal protective equipment, and 4) quality

East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection","abstract":"Background\nThe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus involved in cases and case clusters of severe acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK.\n\n We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification.\n\n We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes.\n\n\nFindings\nA 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid.\n\n Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2?×?106 copies per mL).\n\n Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay).\n\n One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL).\n\n No virus was detected in blood.\n\n The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation.\n\n The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union; German Centre for Infection Research; German Research Council; and German Ministry for

coronavirus: estimation of pandemic risk","abstract":"Background\nThe new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection shares many clinical, epidemiological, and virological similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV.\n\n We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks.\n\n To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS.\n\n We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data.\n\n\nResults\nWith our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R0 to be 0·69 (95% CI 0·50–0·92); by contrast, the R0 for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 0·80 (0·54–1·13).\n\n Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R0 of 0·60 (0·42–0·80).\n\n Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient.\n\n Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R0 would exceed 1—ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential.\n\n We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.\n\n\nFunding\nAgence Nationale de la Recherche (Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases), and the European Community's

general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

(six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

Atypical pneumonia known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly infectious and is currently spreading rapidly around the globe. Before leading to the global emergency, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China during December 2019. Several studies focusing on infected individuals from the general population have been reported; however, limited information is available on pregnancy outcomes for women with COVID-19. Chen et al. reported the maternal-neonatal outcomes and vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy with an infection history of a maximum of 7 days. However, more studies are needed on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women. This case series study was conducted to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on adverse pregnancy outcomes. In this study, the duration from onset of infection to delivery was 1-26 days. Both health-care workers and women from the general population were included in the study.\nClinical details of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2\nTable 1	 	\nParameter	Average (% and/or range)	Comments	 	Occupation	 	 Health workers	3/17 (17.6%)	Nurses and nephrologists were included in this study	 	 Not health workers	14/17 (82.4)	Pregnant women who were not related to medical profession	 	General information	 	 Age (years)	29.29 (24-34)		 	 Date of hospital admission	Jan 25 to Feb 15	All women were admitted from 25 January to 15 February	 	 Gestational age on admission (weeks+days)	37.82 (35-41)	Majority of women had gestational age 38-40 weeks	 	 Gestational age on delivery (weeks+days)	38.1 (35+5-41)	Majority of women had gestational age 38-40 weeks	 	 Number of days from onset of pneumonia until birth	4.2 (1-26)	Only two women had &gt;=10 days of fetus exposure to COVID-19	 	Source of SARS-CoV-2 infection	 	 Contact with infected family member	2/17 (12%)	Only two individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 before admission	 	 Contact with infected patient	15/17 (88%)	Majority of individuals, including healthcare workers, contracted infection inside the hospital	 	Mode of delivery and complications	 	 Caesarean section	17/17 (100%)	All the women underwent caesarean section; however, some of the women had premature rupture of fetal membrane so underwent emergency caesarean section	 	 Complications	5/17 (29%)	Only five pregnant women had complications that caused preterm delivery	 	Signs and symptoms	 	 Maximum body temperature	38.5 C	The minimum body temperature was 36.2 C, most women had a body temperature of c.37 C.

Stillbirth	0/17 (0%)	 	Infected with SARS-CoV-2	0/17 (0%)	 	Neonatal pneumonia	5/17 (29%)	 	\nWe conducted a case series study on pregnant women (n = 17) infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to Hubei general hospital (Renmin Hospital) from 25 January to 15 February 2020. COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed according to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program, fifth and sixth editions. All 17 pregnant women were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 using either quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) or CT scan imaging (Fig. 1), or both. To assess neonatal infection with COVID-19, cord blood and neonatal throat swab samples were collected immediately after delivery in the operating room and were tested using qRT-PCR. All the women underwent caesarean section, and the detailed information collected are presented in Table 1, Table 2 . We conducted a comprehensive literature search for the current outbreak of COVID-19 in pregnant women and a thorough search for the impact of SARS-CoV on pregnancy outcomes.\nThe age range of the women was 24-34 years, the range of gestational weeks at admission was 35-41 weeks and the range of gestational weeks at delivery was 35+5-41 weeks. In 12 women, the nucleic acid test from the throat swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 but in only five women did both the CT scan and the nucleic acid test indicate COVID-19 (Fig. 1 ; Table 1). We observed fever in three individuals and complications in five. Other common symptoms were cough (n = 6), diarrhoea (n = 3), nasal congestion (n = 2), shortness of breath (n = 2) and sputum production (n = 1). Women were receiving antibiotics (n = 17), hormones (n = 8), and antivirals together with Chinese medicine (n = 15). A total of 17 neonates, including three preterm neonates, with birthweights from 2300 to 3750 g (mean 3104.375 g) and birth lengths from 45 to 52 cm (mean 49.2 cm) were delivered by caesarean section. There were no fetal or neonatal deaths. The ultrasound results and fetal heart rate were normal for all neonates and Apgar score for 16 neonates was between 9 and 10. Only two neonates (case 6 and case 14) after birth were suspected of having COVID-19 and five neonates were reported with neonatal pneumonia. Three infants were delivered preterm (Table 1, Table 2).\nBased on our findings in these 17 women, we suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to the occurrence of neonatal pneumonia and preterm delivery. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that these complications can be linked to other biological processes or intrauterine infections. We collected all the samples in the operation theatre with care to avoid the chance of contamination. Hence, according to our knowledge, the collected samples were not contaminated. The focus of this study was to investigate the vertical transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two of the neonates (Table 2) had suspected COVID-19, indicating the possibility for vertical transmission, but we could find no convincing evidence to confirm the vertical transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2.\nNeonatal pneumonia occurred in five of the 17 neonates. In 15 neonates, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the throat swab. The swab samples tested within 24 hours after the delivery were positive in only two neonates (case 6 and case 14). However, intrauterine tissue samples such as placenta, cord blood or amniotic fluid were not tested to confirm if the infection in the neonate was the result of intrauterine transmission. Intrauterine vertical transmission was not reported by either Chen et al. for COVID-19 (n = 9) or Wong et al. for SARS (n = 12).\nIn summary, we found two neonates suspected for SARS-CoV-2 infection and five neonates with neonatal pneumonia, suggesting the possibility that adverse pregnancy outcomes may be linked to COVID-19 infection.\nEthical statement\nThe work described has been carried out

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

Zika virus is a TORCH infection that produces a congenital malformation syndrome and pediatric neurodevelopmental abnormalities.\n Production of efficacious vaccines has been a public health priority for both infections.\n Unfortunately, during the clinical trials and subsequent deployment of a vaccine for the Ebola virus, pregnant and lactating women were, and continue to be, excluded from receiving the life-saving vaccine.\n The most serious consequence of Zika virus infection, congenital Zika syndrome, results from fetal infection during pregnancy.\n Thus, pregnant women have a major stake in the ongoing development of a vaccine for Zika virus.\n The exclusion of pregnant women from the development, clinical trials and administration of a potential Zika vaccine unfairly deprives them and their infants of the protection they need against this potentially catastrophic intrauterine infection.\n When creating policy about these issues, it is important to critically evaluate vaccine safety in pregnancy in the context of the substantial risk of infection for the pregnant woman and her fetus in the absence of immunization.\n","id":"PMC6313913","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Schwartz","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/vaccines8010038","date":"2020-01-19","title":"Being Pregnant during the Kivu Ebola Virus Outbreak in DR Congo: The rVSV-ZEBOV Vaccine and Its Accessibility by Mothers and Infants during Humanitarian Crises and in Conflict Areas","abstract":"The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that began in Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in July 2018 is the second largest in history.\n It is also the largest and most deadly of the ten Ebola outbreaks to occur in DRC, the country where Ebola was first identified during the 1976 Yambuku outbreak.\n The Kivu region is one of the most challenging locations in which to organize humanitarian assistance.\n It is an active conflict zone in which numerous armed groups are conducting violent acts, often directed against the inhabitants, healthcare and relief workers and peacekeepers.\n EVD has been especially problematic in pregnancy—previous outbreaks both in DRC and other countries have resulted in very high mortality rates among pregnant women and especially their infants, with maternal mortality in some outbreaks reaching over 90% and perinatal mortality 100%.\n The development and implementation of the Merck rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine for Ebola infection has been a tremendous public health advance in preventing EVD, being used successfully in both the West Africa Ebola epidemic and the Équateur DRC Ebola outbreak.\n But from the start of the Kivu outbreak, policy decisions had resulted in excluding pregnant and lactating women and their infants from receiving it during extensive ring vaccination efforts.\n In June 2019, this policy was reversed, 10 months after the start of the outbreak.\n Pregnant and lactating women are now permitted not only the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in the continuing Kivu outbreak but also the newly implemented Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN vaccine.\n","id":"PMC7157486","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Schwartz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s40475-019-00195-w","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Maternal and infant death and the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine through three recent Ebola virus epidemics-West Africa, DRC Equateur and DRC Kivu: 4 years of excluding pregnant and lactating women and their infants from immunization","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"CEPI to Fund Three Programmes to Develop Vaccines against the Novel Coronavirus, nCoV-2019. 23 January 2020","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A Dozen Vaccine Programs Underway as WHO Declares Coronavirus Public Health Emergency.

A correlation between clinical and radiological characteristics was observed.\nIntroduction\nCOVID-19 pneumonia first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has since spread rapidly throughout the world. After severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), COVID-19 was established as a third kind of coronavirus causing severe pneumonia. COVID-19 is transmitted by droplets, contact, or orally and has symptoms similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, and other serious complications that pose a huge threat to public health globally. \nCOVID-19 is highly contagious and transmits from person to person. As of April 7, 2020, 1214 466 patients worldwide have been diagnosed, including pregnant women. Pregnancy may trigger important changes in respiratory functions, both anatomical and physiological, making pregnant women prone to respiratory disease. Pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia are more difficult to manage than nonpregnant patients, because drug therapy and intrapartum risk also need to be considered. Past studies have indicated that SARS/MERS infections were found to be associated with severe maternal illness, maternal death, and spontaneous abortion. \nMany current studies focus on the impact of COVID-19 on the general population, with few analyzing its impact on pregnant women. The aim of the present study was to assess the radiological characteristics and clinical presentations of pregnant patients with COVID-19, as well as their correlation.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Informed patient consent was waived owing to the study's retrospective nature.\nA total of 23 pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Central Hospital of Wuhan were identified retrospectively from the electronic medical records database between December 31, 2019 and March 7, 2020. Patients ranged in age from 21 to 37 years (median, 29 years). Suspected cases were excluded according to the clinical diagnosis for COVID-19 pneumonia. The study included patients who received low-dose chest CT and had clinical records and laboratory data available.\nDiagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was based on the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Infection (2019-nCoV), published by the National Health Commission of China (Trial Version 5). All patients in the study had confirmed COVID-19 according to these clinical diagnostic criteria. According to the clinical criteria, four clinical classifications were defined: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. \nLow-dose CT scanning was performed using Somatom Definition FLASH (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) or Philips Ingenuity Core128 (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) CT scanners following the chest protocol, where the patient adopted a supine position with arms raised. Each patient was instructed to hold their breath during image acquisition, which included whole lung volume. The slice thickness for reconstruction was 1.25 mm, and other parameters were set to 120 kV, 30 mA, display field of view (DFOV) 36.0 cm, and matrix 512 x 512.\nCT absorption was defined as: (1) reduction in lesion area, (2) decrease in density, and (3) absorption of some solid components.\nBased on previously published articles, four stages of lung involvement were defined based on CT imaging at the lung window: (1) early stage, (2) progressive stage, (3) peak stage, and (4) absorption stage. All CT image analyses were performed by two experienced thoracic radiologists (YX, 20 years of experience; XW, 22 years of experience) who were blinded to the clinical information. The image findings were determined according to a consensus.\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were expressed as numbers (percentages). Continuous variables were expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR) and were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. P&lt;0.001 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nClinical characteristics\nData from 23 pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were retrieved from the medical records. Nineteen (82.6%) patients had been diagnosed using real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), while 4 (17.4%) patients who tested negative by RT-PCR were diagnosed as positive according to the clinical diagnostic criteria. Three (13.0%) patients had had close contact with other COVID-19 patients.\nAccording to the classification criteria, the clinical stages of all patients were mild or moderate. The main clinical symptoms included cough (n=5, 21.7%), fever (n=4, 17.4%), and nasal congestion (n=1, 4.3%). Fifteen (65.2%) patients were clinically asymptomatic, out of whom four had threatened abortion or premature rupture of membranes. [Correction added on 15 December 2020 after first online and print publication: There were wrong values in the preceding paragraph and have been corrected.]\nTwenty (87.0%) patients were in late pregnancy (&gt;=28 weeks), while three (13.0%) patients were in early pregnancy (&lt;=12 weeks). Eighteen patients were delivered by cesarean section, while two patients had a vaginal delivery. Three patients had voluntarily terminated their pregnancies in the first trimester. Of the 21 neonates, 19 were singletons and two were twins; one neonate had neonatal jaundice. Apgar score for each newborn 5 minutes after delivery was 9-10. Four of the 21 neonates were negative for COVID-19 on RT-PCR, while 17 neonates were negative according to clinical diagnostic criteria following delivery.\nAll patients had been discharged from hospital, median length of hospitalization was 17 days (IQR 13-25) days, with a range of 6-31 days. Median hospitalization time between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients was 14 days (IQR12-17) vs 25.5 days (IQR 20-26.7); P=0.055&gt;0.001.

Three (13.0%) patients demonstrated ground-glass opacity in a single lobe (Fig. 1a), with the smallest lesion diameter at approximately 5 mm. One (4.3%) patient showed ground-glass opacity embodying a symmetrical sphere (Fig. 1b). Twenty (87.0%) patients presented with patchy, wedge-shaped ground-glass shadows mainly along the bronchovascular area and lung field with subpleural area (Fig. 1c,d). One (4.3%) patient had intralobular interstitial thickening with consolidation (Fig. 1e), and 2 (8.7%) patients had fibrous stripes (Fig. 1f). Six (26.1%) patients had concomitant hydropericardium and/or hydrothorax. Median time to absorption was 6 days (IQR 5-8) days, including reduction in lesion area, decrease in density, and absorption of some solid components. The different characteristics of the findings observed on CT scan are classified in Table 2.\nTransverse thin-section CT scans in pregnant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. (a) 32-y-old, 38 wk: ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe with a diameter of about 8 mm; (b) 28-y-old, 39 + 1 wk: bilateral, circular ground-glass opacity in the lower lobes; (c) 30-y-old, 35 + 4 w: single peripheral ground-glass shadow with air bronchograms in the right upper lobe; (d) 29-y-old, 37 + 6 wk: multiple patchy, wedge-shaped ground-glass shadows mainly along the bronchovascular area and lung field with subpleural area; (e) 33-y-old, 38 + 6 wk, day 5 after onset of symptoms: focal ground-glass shadow associated with smooth interlobular and intralobular septal thickening in the right lower lobe; (f) 28-y-old, 38 + 5 wk, day 6 after onset of symptoms: patchy consolidation and fibrous stripes in the lower lobes.\nRadiological characteristics observed in 23 pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia\nCharacteristics	Number (%)	 	Shape	 	Nodules	3 (13.9)	 	Patchy	18 (78.3)	 	Wedge	8 (34.8)	 	Fibrous stripes	2 (8.7)	 	Density	 	Ground-glass	20 (87.0)	 	Semi-solid	8 (34.8)	 	Solid	5 (21.7)	 	Location	 	Subpleural	9 (39.1)	 	Peripheral area	16 (69.6)	 	Intermediate area	5 (21.7)	 	Lung lobe	 	Single lobe	9 (39.1)	 	Multiple lobes	14 (60.9)	 	\nCorrelation between CT manifestations and clinical characteristics\nFifteen asymptomatic patients were in the early stages of disease, with patchy/punctate ground-glass shadows and ground-glass opacity in a single lobe, while three patients demonstrated signs of air bronchus. Eight other patients had abnormal clinical symptoms such as cough, fever, and other symptoms, with consolidation and fibrous stripes in the corresponding CT images. Comparison of laboratory results at first admission and CT absorption revealed that lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate were significantly different (P&lt;0.001; Table 3). Median absorption time in the asymptomatic group was 5 days (IQR 4-6), while in the symptomatic group it was 10 days (IQR 8-12) days, which was statistically significant (P&lt;0.001).\nComparison of laboratory results at two time points in pregnant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia\nLaboratory result	First admission	CT absorption	P valuea	 	Lymphocyte percentage	77.213 +- 1.416	65.591 +- 1.493	&lt;0.001	 	Neutrophil granulocyte rate	16.033 +- 0.309	26.030 +- 1.382	&lt;0.001	 	C-reactive protein	2.975 +- 0.534	1.695 +- 0.310	0.052	 	D-dimer	4.356 +- 1.376	2.310 +- 0.450	0.128	 	\nMann-Whitney U test.\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, most pregnant patients were asymptomatic but had clinically threatened or premature rupture of membranes. Three such patients were examined due to their close contact history with COVID-19 patients. The remaining patients had symptoms during pregnancy, such as cough, fever, and nasal obstruction. The clinical characteristics of the pregnant patients with COVID-19 were similar to those of nonpregnant patients with COVID-19, which was consistent with previous studies. However, the present study had more asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. Previous reports have shown that patients with SARS tended to experience spontaneous abortion due to intrauterine hypoxia triggered by the virus. In the present study, however, only one patient had fetal distress, although it was unclear whether this was associated with COVID-19 or late pregnancy. Three patients had voluntarily terminated their pregnancy during the first trimester, hence, no evidence was observed regarding COVID-19 pneumonia causing spontaneous abortion.\nStudies have indicated that the newborns of pregnant patients confirmed to have SARS or MERS in both early and late pregnancy did not have COVID-19 at birth, with no cases suggesting vertical transmission of the infection from mother to child. However, studies have reported that perinatal COVID-19 infection may confer adverse effects on newborns, causing fetal distress, premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function, and even death. In the present study, 21 newborns had negative results on RT-PCR or no abnormal clinical manifestations, and no vertical transmission was noted, which was consistent with Chen et al. \nThe CT images of the patients showed that they were in early and progressive stages of the disease, illustrating its diversity. Some had intralobular interstitial thickening with consolidation and fibrous stripes, while others manifested ground-glass opacity of symmetrical spheres and concomitant hydropericardium and/or hydrothorax, which is generally similar to nonpregnant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. In addition, the differences in lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate at admission and CT absorption were significant. Accordingly, these laboratory values could be used as indicators of the absorption time of infected lesions; median absorption time for all patients was 6 days (IQR 5-8). Median period of hospitalization was 17 days (IQR 13-25). Length of hospitalization was significantly shorter in asymptomatic patients compared with symptomatic patients (14 vs 25.5 days, P&gt;0.001). Furthermore, median absorption time was significantly shorter in asymptomatic patients compared with symptomatic patients (10 vs 5 days). Interestingly, in just 3 days, one patient with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosed by RT-PCR who had patchy ground-glass shadows on CT imaging had a significant level of absorption and was hospitalized for only 6 days. The clinical curative effect achieved in pregnant women with COVID-19 was significantly higher than in pregnant women with SARS/MERS infection.\nCOVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant patients warrants special consideration as CT radiation is a factor in fetal teratogenicity. Although low-dose CT noise was higher than in a conventional chest CT, its radiation dose was about one-quarter to one-third that of a conventional CT scan, which did not affect the final diagnosis of COVID-19. Therefore, we recommend low-dose CT scans for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\nIn conclusion, the clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were classified as mild or moderate, while radiological findings were classified as early or progressive stages, similar to nonpregnant COVID-19 patients. Median absorption time and length of hospitalization in asymptomatic patients were significantly shorter than in symptomatic patients. Lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate could be used as laboratory indicators for CT absorption. The study's small sample size, as well as the stages of pregnancy for patients during the onset of COVID-19, served as limitations. These issues will continue to garner attention for research in the future.\nAuthor Contributions\nXW, RS, and XW conceived and designed the study. RS, JC, and SZ contributed to the literature search.

study","abstract":"Background\nSince June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has, worldwide, caused 104 infections in people including 49 deaths, with 82 cases and 41 deaths reported from Saudi Arabia.\n\n In addition to confirming diagnosis, we generated the MERS-CoV genomic sequences obtained directly from patient samples to provide important information on MERS-CoV transmission, evolution, and origin.\n\n\nMethods\nFull genome deep sequencing was done on nucleic acid extracted directly from PCR-confirmed clinical samples.\n\n Viral genomes were obtained from 21 MERS cases of which 13 had 100%, four 85–95%, and four 30–50% genome coverage.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 sequences, combined with nine published MERS-CoV genomes, was done.\n\n\nFindings\nThree distinct MERS-CoV genotypes were identified in Riyadh.\n\n Phylogeographic analyses suggest the MERS-CoV zoonotic reservoir is geographically disperse.\n\n Selection analysis of the MERS-CoV genomes reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the S protein.\n\n The genetic diversity in the Al-Hasa cluster suggests that the hospital outbreak might have had more than one virus introduction.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe present the largest number of MERS-CoV genomes (21) described so far.\n\n MERS-CoV full genome sequences provide greater detail in tracking transmission.\n\n Multiple introductions of MERS-CoV are identified and suggest lower R0 values.\n\n Transmission within Saudi Arabia is consistent with either movement of an animal reservoir, animal products, or movement of infected people.\n\n Further definition of the exposures responsible for the sporadic introductions of MERS-CoV into human populations is urgently needed.\n\n\nFunding\nSaudi Arabian Ministry of Health, Wellcome Trust, European Community, and National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research

Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei-Ping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Yi","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia-Zheng","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Zhi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dong-Sheng","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Niang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.06882-11","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence for a common evolutionary origin of coronavirus spike protein receptor-binding subunits","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.1116480","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ff14SB: improving the accuracy of protein side chain and backbone parameters from ff99SB","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature12005","date":"2013-02-13","title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature12005) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7095326","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"V.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Covid-19 in Wuhan, China\nTo the Editor: Despite the large and rapidly rising number of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and resulting deaths, there are limited data about the clinical characteristics of pregnant women with the disease. We extracted information regarding epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19 through the epidemic reporting system of the National Health Commission of China, which stores the medical records of all 50 designated hospitals in Wuhan city.\nFrom December 8, 2019, to March 20, 2020, we identified 118 pregnant women with Covid-19 in Wuhan according to the criteria of the Chinese Clinical Guidance for Covid-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment; 84 women (71%) had positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the remaining 34 (29%) had suggestive findings on computed tomography (CT) of the chest. Criteria for mild, severe, and critical disease and other methodologic details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org. The pregnant patients represented 0.24% of all reported patients with Covid-19 at these hospitals during this time.\nThe median age of the women was 31 years (interquartile range, 28 to 34); 55 of 106 (52%) were nulliparous, and 75 of 118 (64%) had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the third trimester. The most common symptoms in 112 women with available data were fever (in 75%) and cough (in 73%) (Table 1). Lymphopenia was present in 51 of 116 patients (44%). A total of 88 of the 111 women (79%) who underwent chest CT had infiltrates in both lungs. Additional clinical data are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nA total of 109 of 118 women (92%) had mild disease, and 9 (8%) had severe disease (hypoxemia), 1 of whom received noninvasive mechanical ventilation (critical disease). Severe disease developed in 6 of the 9 women after delivery, and the woman who received noninvasive mechanical ventilation did so after delivery. As of March 20, a total of 109 of 116 women (94%) had been discharged, including all women with severe or critical disease. There were no deaths.\nAmong the study population, there were 3 spontaneous abortions, 2 ectopic pregnancies, and 4 induced abortions (all owing to patients' concerns about Covid-19). A total of 68 of 118 patients (58%) delivered during the study period, accounting for 0.56% of all deliveries in Wuhan during this time, and had 70 births (2 sets of twins). Of these 68 patients, 63 (93%) underwent a cesarean section; in 38 of 62 cases (61%), the procedure was performed because of concern about the effects of Covid-19 on the pregnancy. A total of 14 deliveries (21%) were premature; 8 were induced (7 owing to concern about Covid-19). No babies had neonatal asphyxia.\nTesting for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on neonatal throat swabs of 8 newborns and breast-milk samples of 3 mothers. No positive results were reported.\nThe risk of severe disease in our pregnant population (8%) compared favorably with the risk reported in the general population of patients presenting with Covid-19 across mainland China (15.7%). Previous data have shown lower rates of severe disease among women and younger patients than among men and older patients. The present data do not suggest an increased risk of severe disease among pregnant women, as has been observed with influenza. The exacerbations of respiratory disease that are observed in women during the postpartum period are likely to relate to pathophysiological changes (e.g., increased circulating blood volume) that occur in this period.\nSupported by grants (72042013, 81521002, and 81730038) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and Technology Plan, Wuhan University Medical Development Plan.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159281","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Huijun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuechen","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiafu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dongchi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huixia","surname":"Yang","email":"yanghuixia@bjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Hou","email":"houwei@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuanzhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyuanzhen@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evolution of the novel coronavirus from the ongoing Wuhan outbreak and modeling of its spike protein for risk of human transmission","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Wuhan coronavirus has strong ability to infect humans","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effects of intrauterine exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids on fetal, newborn, and infant hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in humans: a systematic review","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Summary of probable SARS cases with onset of illness from 1 November 2002 to 31 July 2003","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of women with severe acute respiratory syndrome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

Of 99 patients, 21 (21.2%) who delivered had preterm birth, including 6 with preterm premature rupture of membranes. The rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation was 6.1% (6/99). One case of severe neonatal asphyxia resulted in neonatal death. Furthermore, 86 of the 100 neonates tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had negative results; of these, paired amniotic fluid and cord blood samples from 10 neonates used to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had negative results.\nConclusion\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and spontaneous preterm birth. There is no evidence of vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection when the infection manifests during the third trimester of pregnancy.\nClick Video under article title in Contents at ajog.org \nAJOG at a Glance\nWhy was this study conducted?\nTo report maternal and neonatal outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy of 116 patients.\nKey findings\nThere were 8 cases (6.9%, 8/116) of severe pneumonia but no maternal deaths.\nOne of 8 patients (12.5%, 1/8) who presented in the first trimester and early second trimester had a missed spontaneous abortion.\nThe rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation was 6.1% (6/99).\nEighty-six of 100 neonates tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), had negative results.\nWhat does this add to what is known?\nSARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and spontaneous preterm birth.\nThere is no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection when the infection manifests during the third trimester of pregnancy.\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global public health emergency. Since the first case of COVID-19 pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, the infection has spread rapidly to the rest of China and beyond. Coronaviruses are enveloped, nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. The epidemics caused by 2 beta-coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have caused more than 10,000 cumulative cases in the past 2 decades, with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 belongs to the same beta-coronavirus subgroup, and it has genome similarity of about 80% and 50% with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. The latest report from the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 3, 2020, estimated the global mortality rate of COVID-19 to be 3.4%, although recent reports that have used appropriate adjustment for the case ascertainment rate and time lag between symptoms onset and death suggest the mortality rate to be lower at 1.4%.  \nPregnant women are especially susceptible to respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia, because of the physiological changes in the immune and cardiopulmonary systems (eg, diaphragm elevation, increased oxygen consumption, and edema of the respiratory tract mucosa), which can render them intolerant to hypoxia. The 1918 influenza pandemic caused a mortality rate of 2.6% in the overall population, but 37% among pregnant women. In 2009, pregnant women were reported to be at an increased risk for complications from the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection, with a higher estimated rate of hospital admission than in the general population. In 2003, it was reported that approximately 50% of pregnant women who received a diagnosis for SARS-CoV were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), around 33% of pregnant women with SARS-CoV required mechanical ventilation, and the mortality rate was as high as 25% for these women. \nTo date, data on the effect of COVID-19 in pregnancy are limited to small case series. This multicenter study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 116 pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia and the vertical transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy design and participants\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (reference 2020004) and Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (reference WDRY2020-K015, WDRY2020-K016). For the collection of clinical data, verbal consent from pregnant women was obtained, and written informed consent was waived considering the urgent need to collect data. Written informed consent was obtained from pregnant women who agreed to the testing of biological samples and neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. Data were analyzed and interpreted by the authors. All the authors reviewed the manuscript and vouched for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the adherence of the study to the protocol. The funding agencies did not participate in the study design, data collection, data analysis, or writing of the report.\nData collection\nThis was an expanded series from 4 previous small case series.   We obtained the medical records and compiled clinical and outcome data for consecutive pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia from 25 hospitals (Supplemental Material) within and outside of Hubei Province between January 20, 2020, and March 24, 2020. COVID-19 was diagnosed on the basis of the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program published by the National Health Commission of China. A laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay of maternal pharyngeal swab specimens. At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak within Hubei Province, China, cases with relevant symptoms, marked epidemiologic history, and typical chest computed tomography (CT) findings were clinically diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia, whereas the viral nucleic acid test was reported to have a false-negative rate of 30%. \nComplete epidemiologic history, clinical symptoms or signs, laboratory and radiologic findings, treatment measures, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records by a team of experienced clinicians and curated with customized data collection form. All laboratory testing and radiologic assessments, including chest CT, were performed according to the clinical care needs of the patient. Laboratory assessments consisted of complete blood cell count, liver and renal function, electrolytes, C-reactive protein, and coagulation testing. We determined the presence of a radiologic abnormality based on the documentation or description in medical charts. The date of onset of disease was defined as the day when the symptoms were noticed. The intervals from onset of disease to hospital admission and delivery were recorded. Data on pregnancy and neonatal outcome, including gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, indication for cesarean delivery, complications, neonatal birthweight, Apgar scores, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, were collected. The date of data cutoff for outcomes was March 24, 2020. The degree of severity of COVID-19 pneumonia (severe vs nonsevere) was defined by the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. \nTwo study investigators (J.Y. and J.J.) independently reviewed the data collection forms to verify data accuracy. Major disagreement between them was resolved by consultation with a third investigator (H.Y.).\nSample collection\nAmniotic fluid samples from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were obtained through direct needle syringe aspiration at the time of cesarean delivery. Cord blood and neonatal pharyngeal swab samples were collected immediately after delivery in the operating or delivery room. Evidence of vertical transmission was evaluated by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in these clinical samples. In addition, vaginal secretion samples were collected from the lower third of the vagina on admission, and breast milk samples were collected at first lactation in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All samples were processed at the State Key Laboratory of Virology, Institute of Medical Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, and Laboratory Medicine Center of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University for further testing. Sample collection, processing, and laboratory testing complied with WHO guidance. All samples, as described above, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using qRT-PCR with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended kit.\nStudy outcomes\nThe primary endpoint was admission to ICU, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary endpoints were the rates of spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, and neonatal COVID-19.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables were expressed as means (standard deviations [SDs]) or medians (interquartile ranges [IQRs]) or simple ranges, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as numbers and percentages. The results were presented in the total study population and according to the methods of diagnosis for COVID-19 pneumonia. The statistical software SPSS for Windows version 23 (SPSS, IL) was used for data analyses.\nResults\nClinical characteristics\nDemographics, baseline characteristics, and clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 infection in pregnant women\nClinical characteristics	All patients (n=116)	Laboratory confirmed (n=65)	Clinically diagnosed (n=51)	 	Age, y				 	 Mean+-SD	30.8+-3.8	30.3+-3.7	31.3+-4.0	 	 Range	24.0-41.0	24.0-40.0	24.0-41.0	 	Gestational age on admission, wk				 	 Median (IQR)	38.0 (36.0, 39.1)	36.7 (33.8, 38.4)	39.0 (38.0, 39.4)	 	 Range	5-41+2	5-41+2	30-41	 	 &lt;13+6, n (%)	4 (3.4)	4 (6.2)	0	 	 14-27+6, n (%)	6 (5.2)	6 (9.2)	0	 	 28-36+6, n (%)	30 (25.9)	24 (36.9)	6 (11.8)	 	 &gt;=37, n (%)	76 (65.5)	31 (47.7)	45 (88.2)	 	Parity				 	 Nulliparous, n (%)	64 (55.2)	37 (56.9)	27 (52.9)	 	 Multiparous, n (%)	52 (44.8)	28 (43.1)	24 (47.1)	 	 Epidemiologic history	107 (92.3)	65 (100)	42 (82.3)	 	 Relevant environmental exposure, n (%)	69 (59.5)	39 (60.0)	30 (58.8)	 	 Contact with infected person, n (%)	38 (32.8)	26 (40.0)	12 (23.5)	 	Symptoms				 	 Fevera, n (%)	59 (50.9)	45(69.2)	14 (27.5)	 	 Cough, n (%)	33 (28.4)	28 (43.1)	5 (9.8)	 	 Fatigue, n (%)	15 (12.9)	13 (20.0)	2 (3.9)	 	 Shortness of breath, n (%)	9 (7.8)	8 (12.3)	1 (2.0)	 	 Sore throat, n (%)	10 (8.6)	10 (15.4)	0	 	 Myalgia, n (%)	6 (5.2)	5 (7.7)	1 (2.0)	 	 Dyspnea, n (%)	3 (2.6)	3 (4.6)	0	 	 Diarrhea, n (%)	1 (0.9)	1 (1.5)	0	 	 No symptoms, n (%)	27 (23.3)	6 (9.2)	21 (41.2)	 	Pregnancy complications				 	 Gestational diabetes mellitus	9 (7.8)	3 (4.6)	6 (11.8)	 	 Hypertensive disorders	5 (4.3)	2 (3.1)	3 (5.9)	 	 Preeclampsia	4 (3.4)	1 (1.5)	3 (5.9)	 	Disease severity				 	 Severe	8 (6.9)	6 (9.2)	2 (3.9)	 	 Nonsevere	108 (93.1)	59 (90.8)	49 (96.1)	 	Treatment				 	 Antibiotic therapy	109 (94.0)	58 (89.2)	51 (100)	 	 Antiviral therapy	63 (54.3)	48 (73.8)	15 (29.4)	 	 Use of corticosteroid	37 (31.9)	26 (40.0)	11 (21.6)	 	 ICU admission	8 (6.9)	6 (9.2)	2 (3.9)	 	 Noninvasive ventilation	6 (5.2)	6 (9.2)	0	 	 Invasive mechanical ventilation	2 (1.7)	2 (3.1)	0	 	 ECMO	1 (0.9)	1 (1.5)	0	 	 Plasmapheresis	1 (0.9)	0	1 (2.0)	 	Clinical outcomes				 	 Remained in hospital	40 (34.5)	24 (36.9)	16 (31.4)	 	 Discharged	76 (65.5)	41 (63.1)	35 (68.6)	 	Died	0	0	0	 	\nECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; SD, standard deviation.\nYan et al.

Outcomes were followed up until March 24, 2020.\nThe characteristics and outcomes of the study population of 116 cases, including 65 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 51 cases of clinically diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia, are presented in Table 1 . The mean age was 30.8 (range 24-41) years, and median gestational age on admission was 38+0 (IQR 36+0-39+1) weeks. In 59.5% (69/116) of cases, women reported a history of relevant environmental exposure, and 32.8% (38/116) had contact with infected persons. The most common symptoms at presentation were fever in 50.9% (59/116), cough in 28.4% (33/116), and fatigue in 12.9% (15/116) of cases. In 23.3% (27/116) of cases, there were no signs or symptoms of the disease, 77.8% (21/27) of which were clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. All these 21 cases underwent investigations because of marked epidemiologic history.\nOf note, there were 9 patients (7.8%, 9/116) with gestational diabetes and 5 (4.3%, 5/116) with hypertensive disorders, including 4 (3.4%, 4/116) with preeclampsia, and these pregnancy complications were unrelated to COVID-19 pneumonia. There were 8 patients (6.9%, 8/116) with severe pneumonia, all required ICU admission, 1 of whom (0.9%, 1/116) required plasmapheresis, 6 (5.2%, 6/116) received noninvasive ventilation, 2 (1.7%, 2/116) received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1 (0.9%, 1/116) received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Clinical details of severe pneumonia cases are presented in the Supplemental Table. A total of 76 (65.5%, 76/116) cases had been discharged. There were no cases of maternal death.\nLaboratory and radiologic findings of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 on admission\nLaboratory and radiologic findings	All patients (n=116)	Laboratory confirmed (n=65)	Clinically diagnosed (n=51)	 	Leucocytes (*109/L; reference rangea)	 	Median (IQR)	7.9 (5.9, 10.6)	7.5 (5.2, 9.8)	8.9 (6.7, 11.0)	 	 Decreased, n (%)	28 (24.1)	20 (30.8)	8 (15.7)	 	 Normal, n (%)	85 (73.3)	42 (64.6)	43 (84.3)	 	 Increased, n (%)	3 (2.6)	3 (4.6)	0	 	Lymphocytes (*109/L; reference range, 1.1-3.2)	 	Median (IQR)	1.2 (0.9, 1.6)	1.0 (0.8, 1.6)	1.3 (1.1, 1.6)	 	 Decreased, n (%)	51 (44.0)	38 (58.5)	13 (25.5)	 	 Normal, n (%)	64 (55.1)	26 (40.0)	38 (74.5)	 	 Increased, n (%)	1 (0.9)	1 (1.5)	0	 	C-reactive protein concentration (mg/L; reference range, 0-10)	 	Median (IQR)	9.3 (3.3, 28.0)	16.6 (5.3, 37.9)	5.9 (2.6, 21.6)	 	 Increased, n (%)	51 (44.0)	32 (49.2)	19 (37.3)	 	 Normal, n (%)	53 (45.7)	24 (36.9)	29 (56.9)	 	CT chest findings (n=108)				 	 Patchy shadowing or ground-glass opacity, n (%)	104 (96.3)	53 (93.0)	51 (100%)	 	 Negative finding, n (%)	4 (3.7)	4 (7.0)	0	 	\nCT, computed tomography; IQR, interquartile range.\nYan et al.

Data are expressed as n (%). Increased means over the upper limit of the reference range and decreased means below the lower limit of the reference range.\nOn admission, lymphocytopenia was present in 44.0% (51/116) of the patients and leukopenia was present in 24.1% (28/116) of patients, according to pregnancy-specific reference ranges. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein were found in 44% of the patients. Patients with severe disease had more prominent laboratory abnormalities (including lymphocytopenia and leukopenia) than those with nonsevere disease. In cases that underwent chest CT scans at the time of admission, 96.3% (104/108) revealed abnormal results. Of note, all cases of clinically diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia exhibited abnormal chest CT findings (Table 2 ).\nPregnancy outcomes\nOf the 116 pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia, 8 cases presented before 24 weeks' gestation. One case (12.5%, 1/8) was complicated with a missed spontaneous abortion at 5+2 weeks at presentation with fever and fatigue. In the remaining 7 ongoing cases, 4 had reached 20 weeks, and morphology scan revealed normal anatomy and fetal growth. Ten cases presented between 24 and 33+6 weeks, of which 7 cases are ongoing, 1 delivered at term, and 2 cases (20%, 2/10) had iatrogenic preterm delivery. One had a cesarean delivery at 28+1 weeks on the same day of admission for severe pneumonia; 1 had a cesarean delivery at 31+6 weeks on the same day of admission for twin pregnancy. Of the 22 cases presented between 34 and 36+6 weeks, 19 delivered preterm, 2 delivered at term, and 1 case remained undelivered. There were 27.3% (6/22) women who had preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), 2 cases (33.3%, 2/6) resulted in vaginal delivery; 4 cases (66.7%, 4/6) required cesarean delivery, with 3 cases indicated for symptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia and 1 because of history of previous cesarean delivery. There are 16 ongoing pregnancies, with 1 patient with gestational diabetes mellitus and the other 15 patients with no fetal or maternal complications reported as of March 24, 2020.\nPregnancy and neonatal outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019\nOutcome	All deliveries (n=99)	Laboratory confirmed (n=50)	Clinically diagnosed (n=49)	 	Mode of delivery				 	 Cesarean delivery, n (%)	85 (85.9)	44 (88.0)	41 (83.7)	 	 Vaginal delivery, n (%)	14 (14.1)	6 (12.0)	8 (16.3)	 	Indication of cesarean deliverya				 	 COVID-19 pneumonia, n (%)	33 (38.8)	19 (43.2)	14 (34.1)	 	 Previous cesarean delivery, n (%)	16 (18.8)	8 (18.2)	8 (19.5)	 	 Fetal distress, n (%)	9 (10.6)	7 (15.9)	2 (4.9)	 	 Failure to progress, n (%)	5 (5.9)	3 (6.8)	2 (4.9)	 	 Preeclampsia, n (%)	4 (4.7)	1 (2.3)	3 (7.3)	 	 Abnormal fetal growth, n (%)	2 (2.4)	0	2 (4.9)	 	 Placenta previa, n (%)	3 (3.5)	0	3 (7.3)	 	 Others, n (%)	13 (15.3)	6 (13.6)	7 (17.1)	 	Onset of symptoms to delivery, d				 	 Median (IQR)	2.5 (1.0, 6.7)	4.0 (1.0, 7.0)	4.0 (0.5, 8.5)	 	 Range	0-38.0	0-38.0	0-22.0	 	Gestational age at delivery				 	 Median (IQR)	38.4 (37.3, 39.4)	38.0 (36.6, 39.2)	39.0 (38.1, 39.4)	 	 Range	28.1-41.3	28.1-41.3	31.9-41.0	 	 &lt;34 wk, n (%)	2 (2.0)	1 (2.0)	1 (2.0)	 	 34-36+6 wk, n (%)	19 (19.2)	15 (30.0)	4 (8.2)	 	 &gt;=37 wk, n (%)	78 (78.8)	34 (68.0)	44 (89.8)	 	Preterm delivery before 34 wk, n (%)	2 (2.0)	1 (2.0)	1 (2.0)	 	 Spontaneous labor-PPROM	0	0	0	 	Preterm delivery before 37 wk, n (%)	21 (21.2)	16 (32.0)	5 (10.2)	 	 Spontaneous labor-PPROM	6 (6.1)	3 (6.1)	3 (6.1)	 	Clinical outcome of neonates (n=100)b				 	Neonatal birthweight (g)	3108+-526	3087+-504	3130+-553	 	Apgar 1-min, median (IQR)	9 (8, 9)	9 (8, 9)	9 (9, 9)	 	Apgar 5-min, median (IQR)	10 (9, 10)	10 (9, 10)	10 (10, 10)	 	Severe neonatal asphyxia, n (%)	1 (1.0)	1 (2.0)	0	 	Transferred to NICU, n (%)	47 (47.0)	17 (34.0)	30 (60.0)	 	 Remained in hospital, n (%)	23 (23.0)	13 (26.0)	10 (20.0)	 	 Discharged, n (%)	76 (76.0)	36 (72.0)	40 (80.0)	 	 Neonatal death, n (%)	1 (1.0)	1 (2.0)	0	 	\nCOVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; IQR, interquartile range; PPROM, preterm premature rupture of membranes; NICU, neonatal intensive care unit.\nYan et al.

Outcomes were followed up until March 24, 2020.\nA total of 99 pregnant women, including 1 with twin pregnancy, delivered their babies during hospitalization, of whom 85.9% (85/99) underwent cesarean delivery and 14.1% (14/99) had a vaginal delivery (Table 3 ). Cesarean delivery was indicated for COVID-19 pneumonia in 38.8% (33/85), previous cesarean delivery in 18.8% (16/85), fetal distress in 10.6% (9/85), and failure to progress in 5.9% (5/85) (Table 3). The rates of preterm delivery before 34 weeks and 37 weeks were 2.0% (2/99) and 21.2% (21/99), respectively (Table 3). Among the 21 preterm deliveries, 28.6% (6/21) had PPROM, 2 of which resulted in vaginal deliveries. There were no cases with spontaneous onset of labor. The rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks was therefore 6.1% (6/99). No cases of spontaneous preterm delivery before 34 weeks were reported.\nThere were no cases of fetal deaths. Among 100 neonates, there was 1 case of severe neonatal asphyxia. There were 47.0% (47/100) neonates transferred to the NICU for further treatment (Table 3). There was 1 case of neonatal death. The mother of this neonate experienced severe pneumonia and septic shock after admission and required ICU admission for invasive ventilation. The neonate (male) was delivered at 35+2 weeks' gestation by cesarean delivery, and severe neonatal asphyxia was reported. He had 1-minute, 5-minute, and 10-minute Apgar scores of 1, 1, and 1, respectively. He was treated with invasive ventilation and died within 2 hours of birth. As of March 24, 2020, 76.0% (76/100) neonates had been discharged, and 23.0% (23/100) neonates remained in the hospital (Table 3).\nThere were 86.0% (86/100) of neonates who underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid on pharyngeal swab samples and the results were negative. Of these 86 neonates, paired amniotic fluid and cord blood samples from 10 neonates tested for SARS-CoV-2 had negative results.   In addition, 6 patients consented and had their vaginal secretion samples tested; the test results were negative. Twelve patients had their breast milk samples tested, and the test results were negative.   \nComments\nPrincipal findings\nWe report clinical data from 116 pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This descriptive study found that (1) the clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 pneumonia during pregnancy were similar to those of nonpregnant adults with COVID-19 pneumonia, as previously reported  ; (2) 23.3% (27/116) of pregnant patients did not present with symptoms, but most of these patients were diagnosed as having COVID-19 pneumonia based on clinical criteria during the peak of the outbreak in Hubei Province, China; (3) 6.9% (8/116) of pregnant patients experienced severe pneumonia that required ICU admission and none died as of March 24, 2020; (4) the rate of spontaneous abortion was 12.5% (1/8); (5) the rate of preterm birth before 37 weeks was 21.2% (21/99), one-third of which had PPROM that resulted in 6.1% (6/99) spontaneous preterm birth rate; and (6) 86.0% (86/100) neonates who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid on pharyngeal samples had negative results; 10 of these 86 neonates had paired amniotic fluid and cord blood samples that also had negative results for SARS-CoV-2.\nClinical implications\nTo date, summarized data from 5 small series, with a total of 56 pregnant women diagnosed as having COVID-19 during the second and third trimester, indicated that the most common symptoms at presentation were fever and cough; two-third of the patients had lymphopenia and increased C-reactive protein, and 83% of cases had chest CT scan revealing multiple patches of ground-glass opacity in the lungs. The rate of preterm delivery before 37 weeks was 44%, and 94% of cases had cesarean delivery. Our data were an expanded series that included 33 published cases.   We had reported clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics that are similar to published pregnant and nonpregnant cases of COVID-19 pneumonia.   Notably, our series included cases of COVID-19 diagnosed by clinical criteria. Most of these cases presented at term, and all women exhibited abnormal chest CT findings. During the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, it was considered acceptable to not wait for repeated qRT-PCR testing to establish diagnosis. There were fewer cases of severe pneumonia in those who were diagnosed clinically compared with laboratory-confirmed cases; cesarean delivery rate and neonatal outcome were similar between the 2 groups.\nNormal pregnancy has been proposed to be a state of physiological activation of the innate limb of the immune response. Pregnant women with acute infection were reported to display a more activated phenotype. In our study, 8 of 116 (6.9%) pregnant women experienced severe COVID-19 pneumonia, which is similar to the rate of severe disease that has been reported across China.   This finding can be attributed to our proactive and aggressive management of diagnosed pregnant cases to minimize the risk of disease progression. There was a lack of clarity at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, and we could only base our practice on past experience with SARS-CoV. As we encountered more COVID-19 cases, we adapted our management, and care was provided by a multidisciplinary team including obstetricians, intensivists, obstetrical anesthetists, virologists, microbiologists, neonatologists, and infectious-disease specialists.\nIt has been reported that viral pneumonia in pregnant women is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, fetal growth restriction (FGR), and perinatal mortality. Based on the nationwide population-based data, it has been indicated that pregnant women with viral pneumonia other than COVID-19 (n=1462) have an increased risk of preterm birth, FGR, and having a newborn with low birthweight and Apgar score &lt;7 at 5 minutes compared with those without pneumonia (n=7310). A case series of 12 pregnant women with SARS-CoV in Hong Kong, China, reported 3 maternal deaths; 4 of 7 patients (57%) who presented in the first trimester had spontaneous abortion, 4 of 5 patients (80%) who presented after 24 weeks had preterm birth, and 2 mothers recovered without delivery but their ongoing pregnancies were complicated by FGR. Our study found reassuring data suggesting that the risk of spontaneous abortion is not increased in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection from the background risk of the general population. Our data also suggests that although the risk of any preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation is increased, COVID-19 is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks. For the 15 cases of iatrogenic preterm birth, cesarean delivery was indicated for pneumonia (n=5), twin pregnancy (n=1), transverse lie with placenta previa (n=1), previous cesarean delivery (n=3), fetal distress (n=3), preeclampsia (n=1), and poor obstetrical history (n=1).\nResearch implications\nOne main focus of this study was to investigate the possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We chose to evaluate amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal pharyngeal swab samples at birth to ascertain the possibility of vertical transmission. Our results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 was negative in all of the above biological samples, suggesting that no intrauterine fetal infection occurred because of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the third trimester of pregnancy when the time interval from clinical manifestation to delivery was up to 38 days. Our findings are in agreement with what was observed with SARS-CoV. However, 2 recent research letters reported on 3 neonates born to women with confirmed COVID-19 who tested positive for immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibodies despite having a negative viral nucleic acid result,   raising the possibility of vertical transmission, but more data are needed. In addition, this study explored whether vaginal delivery increases the risk of mother-to-child transmission during delivery by evaluating the vaginal secretions of COVID-19 cases at presentation and these samples had negative results. In this expanded series, our results further showed negative results for breast milk samples from 12 mothers with COVID-19 that were tested for SARS-CoV-2. \nStrengths and limitations\nThis is the biggest pregnant series to date. Unlike the other case series, our data were collected using a standardized methodology by a team of experienced clinicians, curated with customized data collection form, and verified independently by 2 investigators. There are some notable limitations. First, there were only 8 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia during the first and early second trimester of pregnancy. There are 7 cases with ongoing pregnancy, and we do not have complete data on the risk of congenital anomalies and FGR. Furthermore, 4 cases have reached 20 weeks and a morphology scan has revealed normal anatomy and fetal growth. Because the COVID-19 pandemic has reached a critical stage, we believe it is important to report our pregnant cases in relation to the risk of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and vertical transmission, without waiting for complete outcome data to be available. This would delay this publication by several months. Second, we included cases that were diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria in this series. According to the WHO, these cases would have been classified as probable cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. Given that all clinically diagnosed cases had patchy shadowing or ground-glass opacity on chest CT scan and marked epidemiologic exposure, we believed it was important to include these cases in the total cohort and present the clinical characteristics and outcome data separately from the laboratory-confirmed cases. Third, 34.5% (40/116) of the patients remained in the hospital and some outcomes were unknown at the time of data cutoff. Fourth, we missed patients who were asymptomatic or had nonsevere disease and who received treatment at home; hence our study cohort may represent the more severe end of COVID-19. Fifth, we cannot comment on the risk of vertical transmission when the clinical manifestation to delivery interval is beyond 38 days. Sixth, only a small number of cases had vaginal secretion sample collection at presentation and breast milk samples evaluated for SARS-CoV-2. This study has the limitation to conclude that vaginal delivery and breastfeeding do not increase the risk of mother-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Intrapartum vaginal secretion samples followed by placental tissue, amniotic fluid, and amnion-chorion interface swap samples should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 to explore whether there is a risk of ascending infection during labor.\nConclusion\nThe clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia are similar to those of nonpregnant adults with COVID-19 pneumonia. Currently, there is no evidence that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more prone to experience severe pneumonia than nonpregnant patients. Reassuringly, the risks of spontaneous abortion and spontaneous preterm birth are not increased. There is no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 when the infection manifests during the third trimester of pregnancy. Ongoing collection of clinical data and research is currently underway with the aim to answer some of the questions in relation to the risk of congenital infection, intrapartum management, and mode of delivery.\nReferences\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nNovel coronavirus - China. 2020\nCOVID-19 dashboard. 2020\nEpidemiology, genetic recombination, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses\nA novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome\nIsolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia\nSummary of probable SARS cases with onset of illness from 1 November 2002 to 31 July 2003\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/hdi.12549","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Monocyte/lymphocyte ratio as a better predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients: a prospective cohort study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte counts-rapid and simple parameter of systemic inflammation and stress in critically ill","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2147/TCRM.S206930","date":"2019-05-08","title":"Neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio as an early new marker in AIV-H7N9-infected patients: a retrospective study","abstract":"Background: Avian AIV-H7N9 influenza progresses rapidly and has a high fatality rate.\n However, it lacks an early effective biomarker to predict disease severity and fatal outcomes successfully.\n Our study aimed to explore whether the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) taken within 24 h after admission can predict disease severity and fatality in AIV-H7N9-infected patients.\n","id":"PMC6661995","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Dove","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pengfei","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hainv","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meifang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Yi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianhe","surname":"Gan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinzhong","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weihong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenhong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lanjuan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel coronavirus -

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

Zika virus is a TORCH infection that produces a congenital malformation syndrome and pediatric neurodevelopmental abnormalities.\n Production of efficacious vaccines has been a public health priority for both infections.\n Unfortunately, during the clinical trials and subsequent deployment of a vaccine for the Ebola virus, pregnant and lactating women were, and continue to be, excluded from receiving the life-saving vaccine.\n The most serious consequence of Zika virus infection, congenital Zika syndrome, results from fetal infection during pregnancy.\n Thus, pregnant women have a major stake in the ongoing development of a vaccine for Zika virus.\n The exclusion of pregnant women from the development, clinical trials and administration of a potential Zika vaccine unfairly deprives them and their infants of the protection they need against this potentially catastrophic intrauterine infection.\n When creating policy about these issues, it is important to critically evaluate vaccine safety in pregnancy in the context of the substantial risk of infection for the pregnant woman and her fetus in the absence of immunization.\n","id":"PMC6313913","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Schwartz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/vaccines8010038","date":"2020-01-19","title":"Being Pregnant during the Kivu Ebola Virus Outbreak in DR Congo: The rVSV-ZEBOV Vaccine and Its Accessibility by Mothers and Infants during Humanitarian Crises and in Conflict Areas","abstract":"The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that began in Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in July 2018 is the second largest in history.\n It is also the largest and most deadly of the ten Ebola outbreaks to occur in DRC, the country where Ebola was first identified during the 1976 Yambuku outbreak.\n The Kivu region is one of the most challenging locations in which to organize humanitarian assistance.\n It is an active conflict zone in which numerous armed groups are conducting violent acts, often directed against the inhabitants, healthcare and relief workers and peacekeepers.\n EVD has been especially problematic in pregnancy—previous outbreaks both in DRC and other countries have resulted in very high mortality rates among pregnant women and especially their infants, with maternal mortality in some outbreaks reaching over 90% and perinatal mortality 100%.\n The development and implementation of the Merck rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine for Ebola infection has been a tremendous public health advance in preventing EVD, being used successfully in both the West Africa Ebola epidemic and the Équateur DRC Ebola outbreak.\n But from the start of the Kivu outbreak, policy decisions had resulted in excluding pregnant and lactating women and their infants from receiving it during extensive ring vaccination efforts.\n In June 2019, this policy was reversed, 10 months after the start of the outbreak.\n Pregnant and lactating women are now permitted not only the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in the continuing Kivu outbreak but also the newly implemented Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN vaccine.\n","id":"PMC7157486","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Schwartz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s40475-019-00195-w","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Maternal and infant death and the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine through three recent Ebola virus epidemics-West Africa, DRC Equateur and DRC Kivu: 4 years of excluding pregnant and lactating women and their infants from immunization","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"CEPI to Fund Three Programmes to Develop Vaccines against the Novel Coronavirus, nCoV-2019. 23 January 2020","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A Dozen Vaccine Programs Underway as WHO Declares Coronavirus Public Health Emergency.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

retrospective review of medical records","abstract":"Background\nPrevious studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020 and necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections.\n Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations.\n","id":"PMC7383515","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for
