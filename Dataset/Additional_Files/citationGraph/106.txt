We present our standard practices around ECMO decision-making, retrieval, cannulation, ventilation, anticoagulation, tracheostomy, imaging and steroids.\nMethods\nA retrospective cohort study using data from the hospital notes on all SARS-CoV-2 patients who required extracorporeal support at St Bartholomew's Hospital between 1 March 2020 and 31 July 2020. In total, this included 18 patients over this time period.\nResults\nIn total, 18 patients were managed with extracorporeal support and of these 14 survived (78%) with 4 deaths (22%). The mean duration from hospital admission to intubation was 4.1 +- 3.4 days, mean time from intubation to ECMO 2.3 +- 2 days and mean run on ECMO 17.7 +- 9.4 days. Survivor mean days from intubation to extubation was 20.6 +- 9.9 days and survivor mean days from intubation to tracheostomy decannulation 46.6 +- 15.3 days. Time from hospital admission to discharge in survivors was a mean of 57.2 +- 25.8 days. Of the patients requiring extracorporeal support, the initial mode was veno-venous (VV) in 15 (83%), veno-arterial (VA) in 2 (11%) and veno-venous-arterial (VVA) in 1 (6%). On VV extracorporeal support, 2 (11%) required additional VVA. Renal replacement therapy was required in 10 (56%) of the patients. Anticoagulation target anti-Xa of 0.2-0.4 was set, with 10 (56%) patients having a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism detected and 2 (11%) patients suffering an intracranial haemorrhage. Tracheostomy was performed in 9 (50%) of the patients and high-dose methylprednisolone was given to 7 (39%) of the patients.\nConclusion\nIn our cohort of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure, a long period of invasive ventilation and extracorporeal support was required but achieving good outcomes despite this. There was a significant burden of thromboembolic disease and renal injury. A significant proportion of patients required tracheostomy and steroids to facilitate weaning.\nIntroduction\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid virus that is the causative agent for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an extracorporeal technique providing respiratory and cardiac support in selected patients with severe cardiac or respiratory failure. Initial reports on the use of ECMO in COVID-19 reported a very high mortality; however, a growing body of evidence has challenged these initial findings. In this article, we describe our experience with this technology in COVID-19 patients.\nSARS-CoV-2 clinical presentation\nAfter an initial incubation period of 5-6 days, people commonly present with initial symptoms of fever, cough, diarrhoea, fatigue, myalgia and anorexia. Leukopaenia and raised inflammatory markers (ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein) are hallmarks of the disease. Chest radiography, lung ultrasonography and computerised tomography show areas of change but are non-specific. Diagnosis can be confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of a nasal swab or tracheal aspirate. A vast majority of patients develop mild disease and recover at home, with 4% of UK patients developing severe disease requiring admission to intensive care.\nSevere disease is characterised by hypoxaemic respiratory failure, with most patients meeting the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Other features include cardiomyopathy, acute kidney and/or liver injury, rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, cytokine release syndrome and central nervous system involvement. Risk factors for severe disease include advancing age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension and non-white ethnicity.\nTo date, UK intensive care units have admitted more than 10,000 patients, with a mean age of 59 years. In total, 60% of patients have gone on to require mechanical ventilation within the first 24 h. Overall intensive care mortality is 40% with 26% of patients requiring renal replacement therapy.\nECMO in the UK\nRoyal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge\nThe Royal Brompton Hospital, London\nSt Thomas's Hospital, London\nGlenfield Hospital, Leicester\nThe Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester\nFollowing the 2009 Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 Pandemic, a national respiratory ECMO service was commissioned. Expertise was concentrated in 5 centres:\nA national pathway created allowing for timely referral and retrieval as required. These centres are staffed 24/7 with consultants skilled in the management of respiratory failure, and have mobile ECMO teams available that can be deployed to retrieve critically unwell patients across the country:by road or air as required.\nNHS ECMO referral criteria\nNHS ECMO referral criteria(taken from https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/04/C0156-Extra-Corporeal-Membrane-Oxygenation-ECMO-Adult-Speciality-Guide-1.pdf)	 	Inclusion criteria (updated June 2020)  Potentially reversible severe respiratory failure  Lung Injury Score &gt;= 3 or uncompensated hypercapnia with a pH 7.20 or less  Failed trial of ventilation in prone positioning &gt;= 6 h (unless contraindicated)  Failed optimal respiratory management/lung protective ventilation  Clinical Frailty Scale category &lt;= 3  If RESP Score &lt;= 3, ECMO should be considered only after agreement across at least two centresExclusion criteria  Refractory multiorgan failure  Evidence of severe neurological injury	 	\nIn non-pandemic conditions, these centres have the capacity to care for between 25 and 30 patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, surge capacity was activated at each centre and two extra centres were added to the national framework; St Bartholomew's Hospital, London and the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle. At peak surge, the UK was capable of delivering ECMO to 100 patients nationwide. By the end of May 2020, 216 patients have been placed on ECMO for COVID-19 nationally. National inclusion criteria for ECMO, adapted during the pandemic, are shown in Table 1.\nSt Bartholomew's Hospital (Barts) ECMO service\nThe Barts ECMO service is based in Barts Heart Centre in London, the largest specialised cardiovascular centre in Europe. We provide both venous-venous (VV) and veno-arterial (VA) ECMO service to hospitals within Barts and the London NHS Trust, the largest NHS trust within the UK. This encompasses 4 major hospitals with emergency departments and serves a population of 2.5 million. The service is run by 8 consultants, who can cannulate 24 h a day in addition to several more supporting consultants who can manage patients on our 14-bed intensive care. Referrals are taken directly by the on-call consultant for ECMO and through a conference call multidisciplinary team for all VA ECMO cases. The core retrieval team consists of the ECMO consultant and cardiac perfusionist with additional space for a training fellow. A specially adapted transfer trolley with ventilator, syringe pumps and ECMO machine is transported via a repurposed ambulance along with all equipment required for cannulation to the referring hospital. The patient is brought back to Barts through the London Ambulance Service.\nThe pandemic stretched our services requiring an expansion from a single unit to four wards to cope with the influx of ventilated and critically unwell patients. The ECMO service reached the peak capacity of 10 patients on extracorporeal support. Many doctors and nurses from our cardiology and oncology teams transferred to intensive care for several weeks to assist with the extraordinary influx of critically ill patients.\nMethods\nThis retrospective study included all patients from our institution who tested positive for SARS-COV2 via polymerase chain reaction testing and were placed on ECMO, from 1 March 2020 to 31 July 2020. Patients with SARS-COV2 who were not placed on ECMO were used as comparative controls. To be considered for ECMO, the patients had to satisfy the national criteria as per Table 1.\nECMO technical aspects\nOur standard approach for percutaneous cannulation is a bi-femoral for both VV and VA ECMO. The second-line access point if one femoral access is not possible or a third cannula is needed is the internal jugular vein. If there are insufficient access points, then a bicaval dual lumen cannula can be placed in the internal jugular alone. The insertion of the cannula is through a standard Seldinger approach under linear ultrasound-guided puncture. Additionally to ensure the guidewire is within the correct vessel and maintains position, either echocardiography through a bedside transthoracic subcostal window, bedside transoesophageal bicaval and aortic views, or fluoroscopy in the cardiac catheter laboratory is utilised.\nThe standard ranges of cannula sizes utilised are as follows. Standard femoral venous multistage drainage is a 21-25-French (Fr) cannula placed typically at 45-50 cm (cm) length. Standard femoral venous return is a 21-25-Fr cannula placed typically at 50-55 cm length. Standard femoral arterial return is 15-17-Fr cannula placed typically at 15-20 cm. Standard 27-31-Fr bicaval dual-lumen cannula insertion into the internal jugular vein needs to be carefully positioned using fluoroscopy and transoesophageal echo due to importance of the position and direction of the return jet. The vessel utilised will ideally be twice the diameter of the cannula diameter to reduce risk of venous thrombosis. In the case of arterial access if insufficient blood flow is reaching the distal limb, then a 7-8-Fr return perfusion cannula is inserted to the common femoral artery via ultrasound or fluoroscopy guidance and ECMO blood flow diverted to the limb at 100-200 ml/min.\nWe utilise a mixture of Cardiohelp  (Getinge, Sweden) and Levotronix Centrimag  (Chalicemedical, UK) ECMO systems for our circuits. All retrievals are made on the Cardiohelp  system due to ease of transfer. Patients requiring ECMO for longer durations are often placed on the Levotronix Centrimag  system. The minimum standard blood flow is not lower than 2 L/min to reduce risk of clot formation within the circuit. The blender fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) sweep gas is always maintained at 1.00 (100%) for VV ECMO and titrated according to arterial blood gas analysis for VA ECMO. The initial ventilator settings are designed to rest the lungs, typically pressure control ventilation with a positive end expiratory pressure of 10-15 cm of water (cmH20) and peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH20, respiratory rate 10-15 breaths/min with FiO2 0.3 to 0.5. Our protocol is to wean the sweep gas for VV ECMO and to leave the blood flow at a possible minimum level at all time. Decannulation is typically acceptable once the patient has been stable off sweep gas for a 24 h period. VA ECMO titration is more complex and involves reductions in flow with continuous cardiac assessment via pulmonary catheter and echocardiography.\nAnticoagulation and renal replacement therapy\nAll patients on ECMO were anti-coagulated with unfractionated heparin to a mean target anti-Factor Xa (anti-Xa) level of 0.28 IU/mL. Our usual range is 0.2-0.4 IU/mL for VV and 0.3-0.5 IU/mL for VA ECMO. Some patients had their target range extended to 0.4-0.8 IU/mL if there were also other indications for anticoagulation such as pulmonary embolism. Indeed 10 (56%) of our patients on ECMO developed some form of venous thromboembolism, which reflected higher rates of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis found in the wider intensive care SARS-CoV-2 population. We felt anti-Xa provided a more reliable and consistent result compared to activated partial thromboplastin time ratio in our local laboratory service and this was checked at least once a day and more frequently while achieving a steady state. We had two intra-cerebral haemorrhage, both leading to death, and 2 cases of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, of which one required endoscopic intervention. We were able to run the ECMO circuit without anticoagulation for longer than a week without any issue in the patients with gastrointestinal and intra-cerebral haemorrhage; this is a recognised strategy in ECMO patients at high risk of bleeding.\nA high proportion of ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 required renal replacement therapy, in the ECMO cohort reaching 10 (56%). We believed part of this to be the disease process but also with many having elevated sodium levels a possible reflection of intravascular fluid status. As such, we changed our daily fluid balance targets from the usual negative balances to a more neutral or slightly positive daily balance to pre-empt any pre-renal failure. Many patients within the ventilated SARS-CoV-2 cohort clotted off renal replacement circuits within hours of initiation of therapy despite good access. This did not occur within the ECMO cohort and it was felt to be due to the standard anticoagulation. Indeed, as the pandemic progressed, all ventilated patients on renal replacement therapy were managed with heparin anticoagulation and the issue subsided. A hospital-wide protocol was established for higher prophylactic low molecular weight heparin doses based on a D-dimer cutoff of 3 mug/mL as higher levels were thought to reflect increased coagulability. However, higher D-dimer levels along with consumption of fibrinogen are used as signs of circuit failure within ECMO and therefore less interpretable.\nAirway and ventilation\nAs a standard, we aimed to manage all ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 with lung protective ventilation at 6 mL/kg, paralysis, proning and trial of pulmonary vasodilators prior to initiation of ECMO unless the clinical situation was in extremis. In our cohort, 16 (89%) patients received proning prior to ECMO with the exceptions being two cases of myocarditis felt to be too unstable to turn. As previously described, the initial difficulty was predominantly of oxygenation with maintenance of adequate compliance. However, often within the first week of the ECMO run, patients would often develop compliance below 10 mL/cmH20 and effectively dead space ventilation. This was found to be due to a mixture of issues including dense widespread infiltration of the lung parenchyma, heavy secretion burden with mucus plugging or collapse of lung field from endotracheal tube migration. The latter was often associated with large airways that appeared oedematous with loss of ring cartilage definition and marked tracheomalacia. Indeed some patients if transitioned to a pressure support ventilation mode developed obstructive breathing patterns due to occlusion of the endotracheal tube tip that was overcome by mandatory ventilation modes.\nAs an initial concern for aerosolisation of SARS-CoV-2, most ventilators were run with dry circuits. However, this led to repeated condensation obstruction of heat and moister exchange filters that was seen in other intensive cares in the UK. As such we switched to humidified circuits as normal practice and this was not observed as often. The use of ECMO provided safety with regard to bronchoscopy, and when required patients underwent fibreoptic bronchoscopy for bronchoalveolar lavage and mucus clearance with no concurrent ventilation to reduce risk to staff.\nNine (50%) of the ECMO patients required tracheostomy, which carried a higher than usual complication rate for our centre felt to be due to the abnormal airways described above. The procedure was carried out with specialised ventilated hoods and in a theatre environment to provide further protection from coronavirus\nCardiovascular management\nAll patients had central venous catheters and arterial lines placed. Inotropes and vasopressors were used as needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mmHg. Our first-line vasopressor was noradrenaline, and our first-line inotrope was milrinone.\nIn VA ECMO patients, a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) was inserted to provide continuous cardiac output measurements, and to guide weaning. Echocardiography was also performed daily to assess cardiac dimensions, valvulopathy and readiness for weaning. In VV ECMO patients, cardiac output monitoring was not routinely used; if required, oesophageal Doppler monitoring or echocardiography was performed. Comprehensive echocardiography was performed on the day of admission to the ECMO ICU to assess cannula position and biventricular function, and was repeated when clinically indicated (new signs of shock or cannula repositioning).\nNeurological management\nAll patients had hourly assessments at the bedside of neurological function, in the form of the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score (RASS) and pupillary assessment. While sedated and on ECMO, the target RASS was - 4, and this was achieved using propofol and fentanyl as first-line agents. Neuromuscular blockade was provided with either atracurium or vecuronium, and was targeted to full muscle relaxation using train of four monitoring. If the patient was awake and spontaneously ventilating, a Confusion Assessment Method in Intensive Care (CAM-ICU) score was performed once a day. A full neurological examination was performed twice a day during the ward rounds by the medical teams.\nGastrointestinal and nutrition management\nPatients were enterally fed via a nasogastric or orogastric route as first line. Orogastric tubes were often chosen over nasogastric tubes in patients established on ECMO who were fully anticoagulated, in order to avoid significant epistaxis. Jejunal feeding or total parenteral nutrition was provided in cases of feeding failure; this was undertaken under the leadership of a critical care dietitian who reviewed patients daily.\nImaging\nSuspected neurological complications, based on clinical examination:particularly pupillary abnormalities\nInterval chest CT performed at 7-10 days in individuals with no clinical recovery, looking for organising pneumonia\nCT angiography in patients with acute gastrointestinal or pulmonary haemorrhage\nOur previous experience has shown that computed tomography (CT) scanning is safe and feasible for patients on ECMO. However, this data also showed that the effect of lung or abdominal scanning was modest on clinical decision-making. Furthermore with a risk to staff from exposure to SARS-CoV-2 increased by the movement of these patients in the hospital, we made a decision to not routinely scan our SARS-CoV-2 ECMO population. We utilised chest radiographs and lung ultrasound to provide the majority of diagnostic chest imaging and proceeded to CT when clinically indicated. Clinical indications for CT were:\nOur use of echocardiography has been described above.\nLaboratory tests\nThe patients' full blood count, urea and electrolyte profile, liver function, bone profile and C-reactive profile were tested daily. Heparinised patients had 4 hourly measurements of anti-Xa levels and heparin levels adjusted accordingly until a steady state achieved and then repeated every 24 h. Ferritin and procalcitonin levels were tested twice weekly.\nAntimicrobial and steroids\nAs a standard, all SARS-CoV-2 patients were given treatment with Co-amoxiclav, clarithromycin and oseltamivir (stopped after negative respiratory swab for Influenza) on admission. After completing a 5-7-day course of these antibiotics, further treatment was only instigated if there was clinical, laboratory or radiological indication of a bacterial super-infection. We found that C-reactive protein remained elevated regardless of the clinical status but that procalcitonin appeared to follow the clinical picture of a bacterial super-infection. We found many patients developed similar gram-ve bacterial super-infections, such as Klebsiella pneumonia, even if admitted from remote hospitals within our network and managed on separate wards.\nBased on previous experience with the H1N1 pandemic, the team decided to give pulsed methylprednisolone to patients with SARS-CoV-2 who failed to progress despite 2 weeks on ECMO and lung protective ventilation. This was delivered as a pulse of 500 mg-1 gm for 3 days followed by an adapted regimen of Meduri et al.; 2 mg/kg/day from days 4 to 7, 1 mg/kg/day from days 7 to 14. In our cohort, 7 (39%) patients received high-dose methylprednisolone on an average 14.1 days post intubation.\nResults\nDemographic data for all intensive care patients with SARS-CoV-2.

Their data is displayed in Table 3. The cohort was relatively young with a mean age of 47.3 +- 9.8 years and 89% male preponderance. Black and Asian cohorts accounted for 78% of the ECMO patients. Those with hypertension and diabetes accounted for over half of all patients. The average time of hospital admission to intubation was 4.1 +- 3.4 days. The average time between intubation to subsequent ECMO was 2.3 +- 2 days. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score for our ECMO patients was 12.2 compared to national general critical care population of 14.9. The survival rate (Table 4) of patients in this cohort was 14 (78%). Of the four deaths seen, two were due to intracranial haemorrhage and two had life-sustaining therapy withdrawn due to progressive multi-organ failure. The deaths occurred on average 23.8 +- 12.7 days after admission. Neither of the patients with intracranial haemorrhage had any significant abnormalities in their coagulation profile, and an 11% intracranial haemorrhage prevalence is consistent with previous data.\nDiscussion\nIn our small cohort of SARS-COV-2 ECMO patients, we have observed a survival rate of 78% despite initial reports suggesting a lack of efficacy. This is similar to results from two further published cohorts from Paris and North America.\nOur study has some unique features:our cannulation was performed entirely by intensivists, mostly at the bedside using transthoracic echocardiography guidance, and was mostly femoro-femoral. Our cohort was slightly older than the American or French groups with similarly positive outcomes.\nWe also observed several divergences in the management of patients with coronavirus on ECMO compared to our previous experiences. The profound hypoxia seen in patients infected with coronavirus along with a marked inflammatory response often meant very high blood flows were required within VV ECMO to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation. Six (33%) of our patients required additional drainage cannulas to meet blood flows at times up to 8 L/min. The maximum flow achievable with a single cannula is usually around 5 L/min before suctioning events precluded further increase in flow.\nFive (28%) of patients with profound shock thought to be a SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis required an arterial return cannula. Of these, 2 required initial veno-arterial ECMO, 1 required veno-venous-arterial (VVA) ECMO, and 2 on VV required conversion to VVA ECMO. The oxygenators we utilise are rated for 8-10 L/min of flow but can struggle to function with a flow rate above 7 L/min and in two cases an additional oxygenator was added into the circuit due to continuing hypoxia with high ECMO flows. This achieved a small improvement in oxygen saturation levels in both patients.\nThe average length of ECMO run was longer than we had previously seen for ARDS with an average run of 17.7 +- 9.4 days. During this time, 5 (28%) patients required a single circuit change due to rising trans-membrane pressures. There were no emergency ECMO complications such as pump failure or air entrainment in our cohort and no unanticipated cardiac arrests.\nWe empirically gave steroids prior to the publication of the RECOVERY trial purely based on local expert opinion, and only in cases of refractory respiratory failure. The publication of RECOVERY provided some validation to our steroid use, and we have changed our unit protocols for managing COVID patients appropriately.\nDespite close monitoring of anticoagulation, 2 patients developed intracranial haemorrhages which were rapidly detected, but were sadly too extensive for neurosurgical intervention. Both patients lost brainstem reflexes and were palliated.\nTwo of our patients developed refractory multiorgan failure:one while still on ECMO support, while the other was successfully decannulated but developed refractory pulmonary fibrosis and resultant pulmonary hypertension. There were no significant features at presentation that would have led us to withhold ECMO support in either of these patients. Further analysis into these patients is ongoing at local and national levels.\nOur study has multiple limitations. It is a single-centre study with a small and highly selected cohort of patients, limiting its external validity. Large parts of our protocol were based on usual practice and expert opinion. Nonetheless, we are hopeful that other units may find our experience helpful.\nConclusions\nThe SARS-CoV-2 epidemic stretched our hospital capacity and staff to an unprecedented level the National Health Service has not seen previously. Despite initial discouraging reports of ECMO use, our group persevered and have demonstrated acceptable outcomes comparable to other international experience.\nOther specific aspects of our experience have been longer-than-normal periods of ventilation and ECMO support, a high prevalence of tracheomalacia (leading to difficulties with ventilator weaning and tracheostomy insertion) and seeming success with steroid use prior to widespread adoption.\nThere are several points in these patients' care where traditionally withdrawal may have been considered but persistence appears to be the key message in SARS-CoV-2 with many making recoveries after lengthy critical care stays.\nPublisher's note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nData availability\nOn request by email\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\nInformed consent\nWaived due to the retrospective nature of this study as per our institutional protocol.\nHuman and animal rights\nNone infringed in this study.\nEthics committee approval\nWaived due to the retrospective nature of the study.\nReferences\nZhou F, Yu T, Du R, et al.

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can have symptoms that rapidly evolve to profound hypoxaemia and death.\n\n The efficacy of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with severe ARDS in the context of COVID-19 is unclear.\n\n We aimed to establish the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with respiratory failure and COVID-19 treated with ECMO.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective cohort study was done in the Paris–Sorbonne University Hospital Network, comprising five intensive care units (ICUs) and included patients who received ECMO for COVID-19 associated ARDS.\n\n Patient demographics and daily pre-ECMO and on-ECMO data and outcomes were collected.\n\n Possible outcomes over time were categorised into four different states (states 1–4): on ECMO, in the ICU and weaned off ECMO, alive and out of ICU, or death.\n\n Daily probabilities of occupation in each state and of transitions between these states until day 90 post-ECMO onset were estimated with use of a multi-state Cox model stratified for each possible transition.\n\n Follow-up was right-censored on July 10, 2020.\nFindings\nFrom March 8 to May 2, 2020, 492 patients with COVID-19 were treated in our ICUs.\n\n Complete day-60 follow-up was available for 83 patients (median age 49 [IQR 41–56] years and 61 [73%] men) who received ECMO.\n\n Pre-ECMO, 78 (94%) patients had been prone-positioned; their median driving pressure was 18 (IQR 16–21) cm H2O and PaO2/FiO2 was 60 (54–68) mm Hg.\n\n At 60 days post-ECMO initiation, the estimated probabilities of occupation in each state were 6% (95% CI 3–14) for state 1, 18% (11–28) for state 2, 45% (35–56) for state 3, and 31% (22–42) for state 4. 35 (42%) patients had major bleeding and four (5%) had a haemorrhagic stroke.\n\n 30 patients died.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe estimated 60-day survival of ECMO-rescued patients with COVID-19 was similar to that of studies published in the past 2 years on ECMO for severe

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

(one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

comprehensive radiologic literature review","abstract":"Purpose\nTo investigate the imaging features of emerging COVID-19 pneumonia on chest ultrasound (US), radiographs (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) examinations performed at admission and to provide a comprehensive radiological literature review on ongoing radiological data from recent publications.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nIn this retrospective single-center study, we enrolled consecutive patients from February 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized in Valduce Hospital (Como, Italy).\n\n Multi-modality imaging findings were evaluated and compared.\n\n Literature research was conducted through a methodical search on Pubmed and Embase databases.\n\n\nResults\nFifty-eight patients (36 men, 22 women; age range, 18–98 years) were included in the study.\n\n Among these, chest US, CXR, and CT were performed respectively in twenty-two, thirty-two and forty-two patients.\n\n Lung US findings were consistent with diffuse B lines (100%) and subpleural consolidations (27.3%).\n\n CXR showed prevalent manifestations of consolidations (46.9%) and hazy increased opacities (37.5%).\n\n Typical CT features included bilateral and multilobar ground-glass opacities (GGO) with (59.5%) and without (35.7%) consolidations having a predominantly peripheral distribution (64.3%).\n\n Other imaging features included crazy paving pattern (57.1%), fibrous stripes (50%), subpleural lines (35.7%), architectural distortion (28.6%), air bronchogram sign (26.2%), vascular thickening (23.8%) and nodules (2.4%).\n\n Also, enlarged lymph nodes (14.3 %) and pleural effusion (7.1%) were observed.\n\n The literature review identified twenty-six original studies supporting our imaging chest findings.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe spectrum of chest imaging manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia upon admission includes B-lines and consolidations on US, consolidations and hazy increased opacities on CXR, and multifocal GGO with consolidations on CT.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7129441","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Pascal","surname":"Lomoro","email":"lmr.pcl89@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francesco","surname":"Verde","email":"francescoverde87@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Filippo","surname":"Zerboni","email":"fzerboni@valduce.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Igino","surname":"Simonetti","email":"igino.simonetti@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claudia","surname":"Borghi","email":"clborghi@libero.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Camilla","surname":"Fachinetti","email":"camifachinetti@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Natalizi","email":"an.natalizi@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alberto","surname":"Martegani","email":"amartegani@valduce.it","contributions":"1"}],"References

Characteristics of patients with and without bleeding complications, as per the Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation (ELSO) definition, were compared, and the impact of bleeding complications on

venovenous extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy on immune inflammatory response of cerebral tissues in porcine model","abstract":"Background\nExtra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy is associated with high risk of neurologic injury.\n\n But the mechanism of neurologic injury during and/or after ECMO therapy is still unclear.\n\n Recent animal experiments confirmed that ECMO treatment increases the immune inflammatory response.\n\n The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of VV- ECMO on immune inflammatory response of cerebral tissues and neurological impairment.\n\n\nMethods\n18 porcine were randomly divided into control, sham and ECMO group (n?=?6/group).\n\n ECMO was run 24 h in the ECMO group, and serum collected at 0, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h during ECMO treatment for the analysis of cytokine (IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a) and cerebral injury specific biomarker S100B and NSE.\n\n After 24 h ECMO treatment, all animals were euthanized and cerebral tissues (hypothalamus, hippocampus and cortex) were collected for measure of mRNA and protein levels of cytokine (IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a).\n\n\nResults\nThe results during ECMO treatment showed that all the pro-inflammation cytokines were increased significantly after 2 h, and anti-inflammation IL-10 showed transient hoist in the first 2 h in serum.\n\n After 24 h ECMO therapy, the mRNA levels of pro-inflammation cytokines and anti-inflammation IL-10 were simultaneously up-regulated in cerebral tissues (hypothalamus, hippocampus and cortex).\n\n And protein concentrations also showed different increasing levels in cerebral tissues.\n\n However, during the ECMO treatment, S100B and NSE protein in serum did not change significantly.\n\n\nConclusion\nThese findings suggest VV-ECMO treatment can not only lead to immune inflammatory response in blood, but can also produce immune and inflammatory response in cerebral tissues.\n\n However the extent of immune inflammation was not sufficient to cause significant neurological impairment in this study.\n\n But the correlation between cerebral inflammatory response and cerebral impairment need to further explore.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3766192","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

in patients with acute brain injury","abstract":"Daily interruption of sedative therapy and limitation of deep sedation have been shown in several randomized trials to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay, and to improve the outcome of critically ill patients.\n However, patients with severe acute brain injury (ABI; including subjects with coma after traumatic brain injury, ischaemic/haemorrhagic stroke, cardiac arrest, status epilepticus) were excluded from these studies.\n Therefore, whether the new paradigm of minimal sedation can be translated to the neuro-ICU (NICU) is unclear.\n In patients with ABI, sedation has ‘general’ indications (control of anxiety, pain, discomfort, agitation, facilitation of mechanical ventilation) and ‘neuro-specific’ indications (reduction of cerebral metabolic demand, improved brain tolerance to ischaemia).\n Sedation also is an essential therapeutic component of intracranial pressure therapy, targeted temperature management and seizure control.\n Given the lack of large trials which have evaluated clinically relevant endpoints, sedative selection depends on the effect of each agent on cerebral and systemic haemodynamics.\n Titration and withdrawal of sedation in the NICU setting has to be balanced between the risk that interrupting sedation might exacerbate brain injury (e.\ng.\n intracranial pressure elevation) and the potential benefits of enhanced neurological function and reduced complications.\n In this review, we provide a concise summary of cerebral physiologic effects of sedatives and analgesics, the advantages/disadvantages of each agent, the comparative effects of standard sedatives (propofol and midazolam) and the emerging role of alternative drugs (ketamine).\n We suggest a pragmatic approach for the use of sedation-analgesia in the NICU, focusing on some practical aspects, including optimal titration and management of sedation withdrawal according to ABI severity.\n","id":"PMC4857238","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

progression is a common and devastating condition following traumatic brain injury (TBI), stressing the need for new diagnostic techniques.\n\n Multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) measures platelet function and could aid in coagulopathy assessment following TBI.\n\n The aims of this study were to evaluate MEA temporal dynamics, influence of concomitant therapy, and its capabilities to predict lesion progression and clinical outcome in a TBI cohort.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\nAdult TBI patients in a neurointensive care unit that underwent MEA sampling were retrospectively included.\n\n MEA was sampled if the patient was treated with antiplatelet therapy, bled heavily during surgery, or had abnormal baseline coagulation values.\n\n We assessed platelet activation pathways involving the arachidonic acid receptor (ASPI), P2Y12 receptor, and thrombin receptor (TRAP).\n\n ASPI was the primary focus of analysis.\n\n If several samples were obtained, they were included.\n\n Retrospective data were extracted from hospital charts.\n\n Outcome variables were radiologic hemorrhagic progression and Glasgow Outcome Scale assessed prospectively at 12?months posttrauma.\n\n MEA levels were compared between patients on antiplatelet therapy.\n\n Linear mixed effect models and uni-/multivariable regression models were used to study longitudinal dynamics, hemorrhagic progression and outcome, respectively.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 178 patients were included (48% unfavorable outcome).\n\n ASPI levels increased from initially low values in a time-dependent fashion (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Patients on cyclooxygenase inhibitors demonstrated low ASPI levels (p?&lt;?0.001), while platelet transfusion increased them (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n The first ASPI (p?=?0.039) and TRAP (p?=?0.009) were significant predictors of outcome, but not lesion progression, in univariate analyses.\n\n In multivariable analysis, MEA values were not independently correlated with outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nA general longitudinal trend of MEA is identified in this TBI cohort, even in patients without known antiplatelet therapies.\n\n Values appear also affected by platelet inhibitory treatment and by platelet transfusions.\n\n While significant in univariate models to predict outcome, MEA values did not independently correlate to outcome or lesion progression in multivariable analyses.\n\n Further prospective studies to monitor coagulation in TBI patients are warranted, in particular the interpretation of pathological MEA values in patients without antiplatelet therapies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5790800","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

Traumatic Brain Injury Dynamics: A Systematic Review","abstract":"Background\nThe proteins S100B, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), and neurofilament light (NF-L) have been serially sampled in serum of patients suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI) in order to assess injury severity and tissue fate.\n\n We review the current literature of serum level dynamics of these proteins following TBI and used the term “effective half-life” (t1/2) in order to describe the “fall” rate in serum.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nThrough searches on EMBASE, Medline, and Scopus, we looked for articles where these proteins had been serially sampled in serum in human TBI.\n\n We excluded animal studies, studies with only one presented sample and studies without neuroradiological examinations.\n\n\nResults\nFollowing screening (10,389 papers), n?=?122 papers were included.\n\n The proteins S100B (n?=?66) and NSE (n?=?27) were the two most frequent biomarkers that were serially sampled.\n\n For S100B in severe TBI, a majority of studies indicate a t1/2 of about 24?h, even if very early sampling in these patients reveals rapid decreases (1–2?h) though possibly of non-cerebral origin.\n\n In contrast, the t1/2 for NSE is comparably longer, ranging from 48 to 72?h in severe TBI cases.\n\n The protein GFAP (n?=?18) appears to have t1/2 of about 24–48?h in severe TBI.\n\n The protein UCH-L1 (n?=?9) presents a t1/2 around 7?h in mild TBI and about 10?h in severe.\n\n Frequent sampling of these proteins revealed different trajectories with persisting high serum levels, or secondary peaks, in patients with unfavorable outcome or in patients developing secondary detrimental events.\n\n Finally, NF-L (n?=?2) only increased in the few studies available, suggesting a serum availability of &gt;10?days.\n\n To date, automated assays are available for S100B and NSE making them faster and more practical to use.\n\n\nConclusion\nSerial sampling of brain-specific proteins in serum reveals different temporal trajectories that should be acknowledged.\n\n Proteins with shorter serum availability, like S100B, may be superior to proteins such as NF-L in detection of secondary harmful events when monitoring patients with TBI.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5494601","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Eric

using optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), venous transcranial Doppler (vTCD) of straight sinus systolic flow velocity (FVsv), and methods derived from arterial transcranial Doppler (aTCD) on the middle cerebral artery (MCA): MCA pulsatility index (PIa) and an estimator based on diastolic flow velocity (FVd).\n\n A total of 445 ultrasound examinations from 64 patients performed from 1 January to 1 November 2016 were included.\n\n The median age of the patients was 53 years (range 37–64).\n\n Median Glasgow Coma Scale at admission was 7 (range 3–14), and median Glasgow Outcome Scale was 3 (range 1–5).\n\n The mortality rate was 20%.\n\n ONSD and FVsv demonstrated the strongest correlation with ICP (R = 0.76 for ONSD versus ICP; R = 0.72 for FVsv versus ICP), whereas PIa and the estimator based on FVd did not correlate with ICP significantly.\n\n Combining the 2 strongest nICP predictors (ONSD and FVsv) resulted in an even stronger correlation with ICP (R = 0.80).\n\n The ability to detect intracranial hypertension (ICP ? 20 mm Hg) was highest for ONSD (area under the curve [AUC] 0.91, 95% CI 0.88–0.95).\n\n The combination of ONSD and FVsv methods showed a statistically significant improvement of AUC values compared with the ONSD method alone (0.93, 95% CI 0.90–0.97, p = 0.01).\n\n Major limitations are the heterogeneity and small number of patients included in this study, the need for specialised training to perform and interpret the ultrasound tests, and the variability in performance among different ultrasound operators.\n\n\nConclusions\nOf the studied ultrasound nICP methods, ONSD is the best estimator of ICP.\n\n The novel combination of ONSD ultrasonography and vTCD of the straight sinus is a promising and easily available technique for identifying critically ill patients with intracranial hypertension.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5526499","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Organization registry\nBackground\nMultiple major health organisations recommend the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. However, initial reports of ECMO use in patients with COVID-19 described very high mortality and there have been no large, international cohort studies of ECMO for COVID-19 reported to date.\nMethods\nWe used data from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry to characterise the epidemiology, hospital course, and outcomes of patients aged 16 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 who had ECMO support initiated between Jan 16 and May 1, 2020, at 213 hospitals in 36 countries. The primary outcome was in-hospital death in a time-to-event analysis assessed at 90 days after ECMO initiation. We applied a multivariable Cox model to examine whether patient and hospital factors were associated with in-hospital mortality.\nFindings\nData for 1035 patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO support were included in this study. Of these, 67 (6%) remained hospitalised, 311 (30%) were discharged home or to an acute rehabilitation centre, 101 (10%) were discharged to a long-term acute care centre or unspecified location, 176 (17%) were discharged to another hospital, and 380 (37%) died. The estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 37 4% (95% CI 34 4-40 4). Mortality was 39% (380 of 968) in patients with a final disposition of death or hospital discharge. The use of ECMO for circulatory support was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 1 89, 95% CI 1 20-2 97). In the subset of patients with COVID-19 receiving respiratory (venovenous) ECMO and characterised as having acute respiratory distress syndrome, the estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 38 0% (95% CI 34 6-41 5).\nInterpretation\nIn patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO, both estimated mortality 90 days after ECMO and mortality in those with a final disposition of death or discharge were less than 40%. These data from 213 hospitals worldwide provide a generalisable estimate of ECMO mortality in the setting of COVID-19.\nFunding\nNone.\nIntroduction\nThe severity of COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure and clinical evidence supporting extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) prompted several international organisations including the World Health Organization (WHO), Surviving Sepsis Campaign, and Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) to consider a role for ECMO support during the current pandemic. WHO recommended that expert centres with sufficient ECMO volume to maintain proficiency consider ECMO support in COVID-19-related ARDS with refractory hypoxaemia if lung protective mechanical ventilation was insufficient to support the patient. Despite such optimism for a possible role for ECMO in both acute respiratory and cardiac failure, early reports of patients with COVID-19 requiring ECMO suggested that mortality could be greater than 90%. \nELSO is an international organisation that maintains a registry of ECMO cases among its member centres. In March, 2020, the ELSO Registry augmented its data capture with an addendum designed for ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19 to obtain additional information on these patients. In this study, we used data from the ELSO Registry to report the epidemiology, treatment, outcomes, and hospital characteristics of patients receiving ECMO with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Additionally, we examined whether patient factors and historical hospital ECMO case volume were associated with in-hospital mortality.\nResearch in context\n Evidence before this study \nWe searched PubMed for articles published in English or with English language abstracts up to Aug 7, 2020, with the Medical Subject Heading terms (&quot;extracorporeal membrane oxygenation&quot;) and either the supplementary concept (&quot;COVID-19&quot;) or (&quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&quot;). The search identified 71 manuscripts; review of these identified 13 additional manuscripts. Of the total 84 publications, 38 included clinical data from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-supported patients with COVID-19. The 38 studies identified 202 ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19. These initial reports are small case series reporting outcomes across few centres.\n Added value of this study \nNovel findings in this study include determination of independent associations between mortality and risk factors for ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19. Identified risk factors were age, immunocompromised state, chronic respiratory disease, pre-ECMO cardiac arrest, degree of hypoxaemia, presence of acute kidney injury, and use of ECMO for temporary circulatory support (venoarterial ECMO support vs venovenous ECMO support). Strengths of this study include the breadth of international participation and its use of experienced and trained Extracorporeal Life Support Organization site data managers to collect data.\n Implications of all the available evidence \nThis study of patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO in more than 200 hospitals in 36 countries provides a generalisable estimate of ECMO mortality, and supports existing recommendations to consider use of ECMO in refractory COVID-19-related respiratory failure when performed in experienced centres.\nMethods\nData source and population\nThe ELSO Registry is an international ECMO registry with data for more than 125 000 patients. All ELSO site data managers receive detailed instructions and database definitions to guide data entry, and they all must pass the data entry exam in order to enter data into the ELSO Registry. Accuracy is augmented by a point-of-entry data assessment with error and validity checks. There is also a full record validation triggered on submission of the record that ensures all mandatory fields are completed. \nThis analysis of anonymised data from the ELSO Registry was determined to be exempt from human participant review by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan Medical School. The data collected consist of the standard elements reported for all ECMO runs and additional elements entered into the newly created COVID-19 addendum (appendix pp 10-11).\nAll patients diagnosed with COVID-19, aged 16 years or older, who had ECMO support initiated as recorded in the ELSO registry between Jan 16 and May 1, 2020, were included in the analysis. A case of COVID-19 was defined as the confirmed presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on laboratory testing. A priori, we chose to stop enrolling patients who were initiated on ECMO support after May 1, 2020. Follow-up data were updated until Aug 3, 2020.\nWe additionally report results for the subset of ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19 who met the following two criteria: (1) classified by the ELSO data manager as having ARDS, and (2) initial mode of ECMO support was venovenous ECMO. This subset of patients provided a more focused report on patients classified to have ARDS and receiving respiratory support alone via venovenous ECMO. We also report on the subgroup of patients without ARDS and the subgroup receiving ECMO with circulatory support (see appendix p 11 for description).\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was in-hospital death in a time-to-event analysis assessed at 90 days after ECMO initiation. A time-to-event outcome was necessary because all patients might not have a final disposition at the time of database lock, and calculating in-hospital mortality without accounting for differential follow-up between patients would result in length-time bias. Records in which the last update indicated that the patient had not died, been discharged, or completed 90 days of follow-up after ECMO initiation were administratively censored at the time of their last update. A patient being discharged alive to home or to an acute rehabilitation centre, discharged to a long-term acute care centre or unspecified location, or discharged to another hospital were treated as distinct competing events for the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality. We also report proportion of in-hospital deaths in patients who reached a final disposition of death or discharge from the hospital.\nSecondary outcomes were the proportion of patients remaining in the intensive care unit (ICU), discharged from the ICU but who remain hospitalised, discharged to home or an acute rehabilitation centre, discharged to a long-term acute care centre or unspecified location, and discharged to another hospital. We report ECMO duration, hospital length of stay, tracheostomy use, discharge location, acute kidney injury related to the current illness, use of renal replacement therapy during ECMO (regardless of indication), and the occurrence of complications while receiving ECMO. We also report the reason ECMO was discontinued, and we report the time to death after ECMO discontinuation in patients who died in hospital.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics are provided as median (IQR) for continuous variables and as count and proportion for categorical variables. We calculated the Aalen-Johansen estimators of cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality measured 90 days after ECMO initiation with discharged alive to home and discharged alive to another location treated as competing events. We estimated the cumulative incidence (rather than report the proportion) of in-hospital mortality 90 days after ECMO initiation because not all patients had died, been discharged from the hospital, or were followed up for 90 days. The validity of this estimator requires the standard independent censoring assumption:namely, that the mechanism in which patients are censored is statistically independent of the mechanisms in which patients die or are discharged (appendix pp 11-12). To account for follow-up that is cut short by event incidence (death or discharge), we estimated potential follow-up using reverse Kaplan-Meier methodology. We estimated the distribution of ECMO duration and time to hospital discharge (for any reason) using Kaplan-Meier estimators. \nTo estimate the relative risks between potential risk factors and mortality, we fit a Cox proportional hazards model for the primary outcome of death (appendix pp 12-14, 19). We censored patients who were still hospitalised at the time of the run's last registry update and those who were discharged alive at the time of their discharge date. The Cox model estimated the hazard for death as a function of a linear combination of the following prespecified set of patient-level variables: age, race, sex, chronic cardiac disease, chronic respiratory disease (excluding asthma), asthma, diabetes, cancer, immunocompromised state, duration of pre-ECMO intubation, the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2:FiO2), the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, a diagnosis of acute kidney injury, cardiac arrest before ECMO, and initial ECMO mode (venovenous vs venoarterial or venovenoarterial). Venovenous ECMO support drains and returns blood to the systemic venous system to support the lungs, whereas venoarterial ECMO support drains systemic venous blood and returns blood to the systemic arterial system and can provide heart and lung support. Venovenoarterial ECMO returns blood to both the venous and the arterial systems, and provides both heart and lung support. \nWe generated a second Cox model to estimate the hazard for death that was identical to the previous one with addition of the centre-level covariate, 2019 adult ECMO case volume. This model excluded ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19 who received care at an ECMO centre that had no cases reported to the ELSO Registry in 2019 or earlier (a new ELSO centre). If a centre entered reported cases before 2019, but had no cases in 2019 (an existing ELSO centre), that centre's cases were included and the 2019 ECMO centre volume was measured as zero.\nMultiple imputation was used to account for missing values in predictor variables. Briefly, we used fully specified chained equations in the R package. Ten imputed datasets were created and combined using between/within variance techniques to appropriately propagate uncertainty about the missing data (see appendix pp 13-14 for full details). All continuous variables apart from age were log2-transformed before model fitting. The parameter of interest from a Cox model is the hazard ratio (HR), which describes the relative risk of in-hospital mortality associated with a change in a covariate. Robust sandwich-type estimates of the standard errors were used to account for centre-level clustering. All analyses were done with R version 3.6.1. \nRole of the funding source\nThere was no funding source for this study. RPB, PSB, and PTR had full access to all the data in the study. RPB, GM, and DB had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\nResults\nIn the ELSO Registry, 1093 patients aged 16 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 received ECMO support from Jan 16 to May 1, 2020. 57 patients were excluded because there was not a completed COVID-19 addendum (appendix pp 20, 32). One patient had a previous ECMO run before diagnosis of COVID-19, leaving 1035 patients for analysis.\nPatient characteristics before initiation of ECMO\n		Full cohort (n=1035)	ARDS cohort*(n=779)	 	Age (years)	49 (41-57)	50 (42-57)	 	BMI (kg/m2) 	31 (27-37)	32 (28-37)	 	Sex 	 		Male	764 (74%)	572 (74%)	 		Female	269 (26%)	206 (26%)	 	Race and ethnicity	 		Black	150 (14%)	119 (15%)	 		White (non-Hispanic)	346 (33%)	250 (32%)	 		Asian	152 (15%)	86 (11%)	 		Middle Eastern or North African	35 (3%)	26 (3%)	 		Other	27 (3%)	21 (3%)	 		Unknown	54 (5%)	38 (5%)	 		Multiple	53 (5%)	51 (7%)	 		Hispanic	218 (21%)	188 (24%)	 	Pre-ECMO comorbidities	 		No comorbidity	311 (30%)	243 (31%)	 		Cancer	11 (1%)	10 (1%)	 		Immunocompromised	24 (2%)	21 (3%)	 		Diabetes	245 (24%)	187 (24%)	 		Pre-existing cardiac disease	24 (2%)	13 (2%)	 		Pre-existing respiratory disease	29 (3%)	21 (3%)	 		Pre-existing renal insufficiency	21 (2%)	14 (2%)	 		Asthma	110 (11%)	91 (12%)	 		Pregnancy	22 (2%)	13 (2%)	 		Obesity (BMI &gt;30 kg/m2)	487 (47%)	362 (47%)	 	Acute illness	 		ARDS	819 (79%)	775 (100%)	 		Acute heart failure	50 (5%)	25 (3%)	 		Myocarditis	22 (2%)	7 (1%)	 		Acute kidney injury	301 (29%)	247 (32%)	 	Pre-ECMO cardiac arrest 	48 (5%)	26 (3%)	 	Pre-ECMO co-infection 	 		No co-infection	646 (63%)	479 (62%)	 		Bacterial pneumonia	337 (33)	271 (35%)	 		Viral co-infection	90 (9%)	60 (8%)	 		Bloodstream infection	123 (12%)	106 (14%)	 		Urinary tract infection	38 (4%)	31 (4%)	 	\nData are median (IQR) or n (%).

Viral or bacterial co-infections were suspected or confirmed in 387 (37%) of 1033 patients (table 1 and appendix pp 23-27). Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly cultured organism for bacterial pneumonia and bloodstream infections.\nMost patients (704 [70%] of 1010) received care at another hospital before being transferred to an ELSO centre. Of these, 330 (47%) had ECMO initiated at an outside hospital and were transported while receiving ECMO support. ECMO support for patients with COVID-19 was provided at 213 centres in 36 countries. By comparison, non-COVID-19-related adult ECMO was provided in 395 centres in 48 countries during all of 2019. The median 2019 adult ECMO case volume was 23 (IQR 3-62; appendix pp 16, 28).\nSupportive care and therapies delivered before ECMO\n		Full cohort (n=1035)	ARDS cohort*(n=779)	 			N	Median (IQR) or n (%)	N	Median (IQR) or n (%)	 	Non-invasive ventilation	 		Non-invasive ventilation before intubation	1032	606 (59%)	776	434 (56%)	 		BiPAP	1032	185 (18%)	776	119 (15%)	 		CPAP	1032	140 (14%)	776	80 (10%)	 		HFNC	1032	357 (35%)	776	285 (37%)	 		Pre-ECMO intubation (days)	914	4 0 (1 8-6 4)	688	4 3 (2 0-6 5)	 		Conventional ventilation 	951	942 (99%)	729	721 (99%)	 		PEEP (cm H2O)	868	14 (12-16)	661	15 (12-18)	 		PIP (cm H2O)	699	33 (30-38)	532	34 (30-38)	 		FiO2	888	1 0 (0 90-1 0)	672	1 0 (0 90-1 0)	 		PaO2:FiO2 (mm Hg)	868	72 (59-94)	657	72 (60-93)	 		PaCO2 (mm Hg)	896	60 (50-74)	678	60 (50-74)	 	Pre-ECMO support	 		Prone positioning	1019	612 (60%)	766	464 (61%)	 		Neuromuscular blockade	1015	729 (72%)	762	567 (74%)	 		Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators	1019	293 (29%)	766	242 (32%)	 		Any vasoactive support	1015	606 (60%)	758	447 (59%)	 		Norepinephrine	1015	561 (55%)	762	416 (55%)	 	COVID-19 therapies and immunomodulators	 		Any therapy	1035	786 (76%)	779	633 (81%)	 		Glucocorticoids	1035	420 (41%)	779	331 (42%)	 		Intravenous immunoglobin	1035	29 (3%)	779	22 (3%)	 		Anticytokine	1035	289 (28%)	779	261 (34%)	 		Lopinavir-ritonavir	1035	116 (11%)	779	103 (13%)	 		JAK inhibition	1035	7 (0 7%)	779	5 (0 6%)	 		Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine	1035	538 (52%)	779	443 (57%)	 		Remdesivir	1035	84 (8%)	779	69 (9%)	 	Support type	 		Respiratory	1035	995 (96%)	779	777 (99 7%)	 		Cardiac	1035	29 (3%)	779	0	 		ECPR	1035	11 (1%)	779	2 (0 3%)	 	\nARDS=acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Patients were also commonly supported with vasoactive medications (606 [60%] of 1015) before ECMO initiation, such as norepinephrine in 561 (55%) of 1015 patients. 786 (76%) of 1035 patients received therapy targeting COVID-19; the most common therapy was hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (538 [52%] of 1035 patients).\nOutcomes\n		Full cohort (n=1035)	ARDS cohort*(n=779)	 	Patient status at study completion	 		Discharged alive to home or acute rehabilitation centre	311 (30%)	262 (34%)	 		Discharged alive to long-term acute care centre or unspecified location	101 (10%)	79 (10%)	 		Discharged to another hospital	176 (17%)	97 (12%)	 		Remain in the hospital (discharged from ICU)	11 (1%)	10 (1%)	 		Remain in the ICU	56 (5%)	40 (5%)	 		In-hospital death	380 (37%)	291 (37%)	 		Tracheostomy 	444 (44%)	353 (47%)	 	Select complications 	 		Seizure	6 (0 6%)	5 (0 7%)	 		CNS infarct	7 (0 7%)	5 (0 7%)	 		CNS haemorrhage	56 (6%)	44 (6%)	 		Haemolysis	48 (5%)	37 (5%)	 		Membrane lung failure	82 (8%)	63 (9%)	 		Pump failure	8 (0 8%)	6 (0 8%)	 		Circuit change	148 (15%)	99 (13%)	 	\nData are n (%).

Only 1003 patients in the full cohort and 756 patients in the ARDS cohort reported whether or not they had a tracheostomy; for the remainder it was missing.\nFull cohort n=983; ARDS cohort n=738. Complications were only reported in 983 patients in the full cohort and 738 patients in the ARDS cohort; in the remainder it was missing.\nThe median duration from endotracheal intubation to ECMO initiation was 4 0 days (IQR 1 8-6 4). The overwhelming majority of patients received venovenous ECMO (978 [94%] of 1035); 44 (4%) of 1035 patients received venoarterial ECMO support, nine (0 9%) received venovenoarterial support, and four (0 4%) received other ECMO support. After ECMO initiation, the median peak inspiratory pressure was reduced by 9 cm H2O (IQR 4-13), and the median FiO2 was reduced by 0 40 (IQR 0 00-0 60; see appendix p 29 for ventilator settings and blood gas measures 24 h after ECMO initiation). The Kaplan-Meier median duration of ECMO support was 13 9 days (IQR 7 8-23 3). A tracheostomy was performed in nearly half of patients (444 [44%] of 1003; table 3 ).\nRenal replacement therapy was used during ECMO support (regardless of indication) in 444 (44%) of 1006 patients (data not reported by 29 patients). Other than renal replacement therapy, 538 (55%) of 983 patients had one of many prespecified complications during or immediately following ECMO support (table 3 and appendix p 30). However, individual complications occurred relatively infrequently. Central nervous system haemorrhage occurred in 56 (6%) of 983 patients, central nervous system infarct occurred in seven (0 7%) patients, and seizures occurred in six (0 6%) patients. Collectively, any mechanical complications defined as a circuit change, membrane lung failure, cannula problems, or pump failure occurred in 277 (28%) of 983 patients supported with ECMO. Individually, circuit changes occurred in 148 (15%) of 983 patients, membrane lung failures occurred in 82 (8%) patients, cannula problems occurred in 57 (6%) patients, and pump failures occurred in eight (0 8%) patients.\nStacked bar plots of disposition over time for patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO\nECMO=extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. LTAC=long-term acute care. Discharged (home or rehab) refers to patients who were discharged to home or an acute rehabilitation centre. Discharged (LTAC or unspecified) refers to patients who were discharged to an LTAC centre or to an unspecified location. Discharge (hospital) refers to patients who were discharged to another hospital. Unknown status (censored) refers to patients who at the time of data analysis did not meet one of the following three criteria: (1) died, (2) discharged alive, or (3) survived at least 90 days after ECMO initiation. Hospitalised patients are those still in hospital at the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Centre where ECMO support was delivered.\nAt the time of analysis, 968 (94%) of 1035 patients were discharged from the hospital alive, died, or reached 90-day follow-up after ECMO initiation. 588 (57%) of 1035 patients were discharged alive from the hospital, of whom 311 (30%) of 1035 were discharged to home or an acute rehabilitation centre, 101 (10%) were discharged to a long-term acute care centre or unspecified location, and 176 (17%) were discharged to another hospital (figure 1 and table 3). No patients discharged alive to another facility were discharged to hospice. Of the 968 patients with a final disposition of death or hospital discharge, 380 (39%) died. 309 (81%) of 380 patients died within24 h of discontinuation of ECMO support (appendix p 33), and 322 (85%) were discontinued from ECMO support because of a poor prognosis (appendix p 31).\nCumulative incidence of mortality from time of ECMO initiation\nECMO=extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The solid line represents the estimated cumulative incidence of mortality and the shaded area represents the 95% CI.\nThe estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 37 4% (95% CI 34 4-40 4; figure 2 and appendix p 34). In the subset of patients receiving venovenous ECMO and characterised as having ARDS, the estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 38 0% (95% CI 34 6-41 5). When considering in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO stratified by ELSO geographical region, the results were not distinct (p=0 18) for an overall test of the simultaneous equality of these cumulative incidence curves for mortality (appendix pp 15-16, 35).\nThe Kaplan-Meier median duration of hospital stay at the ELSO centre was 26 9 days (IQR 15 7-43 0). The observed median length of stay was 31 1 days (IQR 21 0-46 0) for survivors and 16 0 days (6 8-27 6) for non-survivors. In patients who survived to hospital day 40 or more and remained hospitalised, the estimated in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 14 1% (95% CI 10 3-18 9; appendix p 36).\nCox model for factors associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 supported with ECMO\nBMI=body-mass index. ECMO=extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. PaCO2=partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide. PaO2:FiO2=ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen. VA=venoarterial. VV=venovenous. VVA=venovenoaterial. *Dataset of 1031 patients; four observations were excluded due to having an initial cannulation mode that was not venovenous, venoarterial, or venovenoarterial.\nThe Cox model showed that temporary circulatory support (venoarterial ECMO support) was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (HR 1 89, 95% CI 1 20-2 97; figure 3 ). Increasing age was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality for those 70 years or older relative to patients aged 16-39 years (HR 3 07, 95% CI 1 58-5 95); and higher PaO2:FiO2 was associated with lower mortality (HR 0 68 per doubling, 95% CI 0 57-0 81). Patients with acute kidney injury, chronic respiratory insufficiency, an immunocompromised state, or a pre-ECMO cardiac arrest had an associated higher risk of mortality. Sex, body-mass index, race, and hours from endotracheal intubation to ECMO initiation were not independently associated with mortality. The Cox model including centre volume suggests that higher adult 2019 hospital ECMO case volume was not substantively associated with lower mortality (HR 0 96 per doubling of 2019 hospital volume, 95% CI 0 90-1 03; appendix p 37).\nDiscussion\nThis study from the international ELSO Registry provides data on 1035 ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19 who received care in 36 countries. Estimated in-hospital mortality 90 days after ECMO initiation was 37 4% (95% CI 34 4-40 4). This international report from the ELSO Registry is strengthened by its breadth, including 213 hospitals providing ECMO, and by employing experienced and trained ELSO site data managers to collect data. Additionally, our analytical plan (a time-to-event analysis) accounts for the potential bias that can be introduced when not all patients in the analysis have reached a final disposition.\nHigh mortality in the initial published experience led some clinicians and investigators to recommend withholding ECMO support in patients with COVID-19. In ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19 and characterised as having ARDS, estimated in-hospital mortality 90 days after ECMO initiation was 38 0% (95% CI 34 6-41 5), consistent with previous mortality rates in non-COVID-19 ECMO-supported patients with ARDS and acute respiratory failure. Our findings provide provisional support for the use of ECMO in COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. \nIn this study, higher 2019 hospital ECMO case volume was not associated with lower mortality. By contrast, a 2015 study from the ELSO Registry demonstrated that higher hospital ECMO case volume was associated with lower ECMO-supported patient mortality. The ELSO Registry data is a collection of self-selected and experienced centres dedicated to improving care for patients receiving ECMO support. Our findings cannot be extrapolated to inexperienced centres.\nIn the largest randomised controlled trial to date of ECMO for ARDS, the ECMO to Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS (EOLIA) trial, 60-day mortality was 35% in the ECMO group versus 46% in the conventional management group (relative risk 0 76, 95% CI 0 55-1 04; p=0 09). A subsequent post-hoc Bayesian analysis of the EOLIA trial, a meta-analysis of trials of ECMO for ARDS in adults, and a network meta-analysis each provided credible support to the existence of a survival benefit of ECMO in refractory ARDS. The patients enrolled in the EOLIA study shared some similarities to the patients with ARDS in this ELSO Registry report with regards to pre-ECMO support, severity of ARDS, and mortality rates. The rate of pre-ECMO prone positioning in patients who received venovenous ECMO for COVID-19 and were characterised as having ARDS was 61% in this study and 59% in EOLIA before randomisation (appendix p 17). The median pre-ECMO PaO2:FiO2 ratio was 72 mm Hg in our study and the mean PaO2:FiO2 in EOLIA was 73 mm Hg. Nevertheless, it is unclear what the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 would have been had they not received ECMO.\nPatients surviving critical illness, ARDS, and ECMO support often have disability that might require prolonged hospital stay or rehabilitation. In this study, few patients were discharged home; rather, the majority were transferred to either rehabilitation or long-term acute care facilities or another hospital to continue recovery. These data highlight the need for future studies to focus on the long-term outcomes of these patients.\nIn our study, nearly all patients had acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, but only 79% were identified as meeting the definition for ARDS. In the Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (LUNG SAFE) study, 78 5% (95% CI 74 8-81 8) of patients with severe ARDS were identified as having ARDS. In our study, it was unclear if patients not identified as having ARDS did not actually meet the Berlin Definition for ARDS or were simply not recognised as having the criteria for the diagnosis of ARDS (appendix pp 17-18). \nOur study has important limitations. First, the ELSO Registry did not externally validate the submitted data or validate that all consecutive cases initiated between Jan 16 and May 1, 2020, were submitted. The ELSO Registry does not contain data on all ECMO cases worldwide; data are collected from a subset of centres participating in the ELSO Registry. These centres were self-selected and needed to have the resources to submit patient data, particularly during a pandemic. Second, although the survival analyses for the primary outcome of mortality account for the incomplete follow-up, we might have underestimated the reported prevalence of complications during ECMO, given that not all patients had completed their ECMO course at the time of reporting. Third, our study was not a randomised controlled trial and thus we cannot draw any definitive conclusions as to whether ECMO should be used in patients with COVID-19 and severe respiratory failure. Fourth, the final outcome 90 days after ECMO initiation is unknown for patients who were discharged home or to an acute rehabilitation centre, discharged to a long-term acute centre or unspecified location, and discharged to another hospital. However, in patients who survived to hospital day 40 or more and remained hospitalised, the estimated in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 14 1% (95% CI 10 3-18 9).\nIn patients with COVID-19 supported with ECMO, both estimated mortality 90 days after ECMO initiation and mortality in those who achieved a final disposition of death or discharge were less than 40%. The results were similar when the sample was limited to patients with COVID-19 who were characterised as having ARDS. Our results are also consistent with previously reported survival rates in acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, supporting current recommendations that centres experienced in ECMO should consider its use in refractory COVID-19-related respiratory failure.\nReferences\nBaseline characteristics and outcomes of 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy region, Italy\nClinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study\nExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome\nExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and posterior probability of mortality benefit in a post hoc Bayesian analysis of a randomized clinical trial\nVenovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis\nClinical management of COVID-19: interim guidance\nSurviving sepsis campaign: guidelines on the management of critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nInitial ELSO guidance document: ECMO for COVID-19 patients with severe cardiopulmonary failure\nPreparing for the most critically ill patients with COVID-19: the potential role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation\nVentilation with lower tidal volumes as compared with traditional tidal volumes for acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome\nPoor survival with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): pooled analysis of early reports\nSARS-CoV-2 registry addendum database definitions\nThe Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry: update and perspectives\nAn empirical transition matrix for non-homogeneous markov chains based on censored observations\nEstimates of absolute cause-specific risk in cohort studies\nA note on quantifying follow-up in studies of failure time\nNonparametric estimation from incomplete observations\nThe Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Maastricht Treaty for Nomenclature in Extracorporeal Life Support.

course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

only intervention proven to reduce mortality is the use of lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategies, although such a strategy may lead to problematic hypercapnia.\n Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) devices allow uncoupling of ventilation from oxygenation, thereby removing carbon dioxide and facilitating lower tidal volume ventilation.\n We performed a systematic review to assess efficacy, complication rates, and utility of ECCO2R devices.\n We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), case–control studies and case series with 10 or more patients.\n We searched MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS (Literatura Latino Americana em Ciências da Saúde), and ISI Web of Science, in addition to grey literature and clinical trials registries.\n Data were independently extracted by two reviewers against predefined criteria and agreement was reached by consensus.\n Outcomes of interest included mortality, intensive care and hospital lengths of stay, respiratory parameters and complications.\n The review included 14 studies with 495 patients (two RCTs and 12 observational studies).\n Arteriovenous ECCO2R was used in seven studies, and venovenous ECCO2R in seven studies.\n Available evidence suggests no mortality benefit to ECCO2R, although post hoc analysis of data from the most recent RCT showed an improvement in ventilator-free days in more severe ARDS.\n Organ failure-free days or ICU stay have not been shown to decrease with ECCO2R.\n Carbon dioxide removal was widely demonstrated as feasible, facilitating the use of lower tidal volume ventilation.\n Complication rates varied greatly across the included studies, representing technological advances.\n There was a general paucity of high-quality data and significant variation in both practice and technology used among studies, which confounded analysis.\n ECCO2R is a rapidly evolving technology and is an efficacious treatment to enable protective lung ventilation.\n Evidence for a positive effect on mortality and other important clinical outcomes is lacking.\n Rapid technological advances have led to major changes in these devices and together with variation in study design have limited applicability of analysis.\n Further well-designed adequately powered RCTs are needed.\n","id":"PMC4056779","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

oxygenation during veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in sheep","abstract":"Introduction\nDifferential hypoxia is a pivotal problem in patients with femoral veno-arterial (VA) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.\n\n Despite recognition of differential hypoxia and attempts to deliver more oxygenated blood to the upper body, the mechanism of differential hypoxia as well as prevention strategies have not been well investigated.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used a sheep model of acute respiratory failure that was supported with femoral VA ECMO from the inferior vena cava to the femoral artery (IVC-FA), ECMO from the superior vena cava to the FA (SVC-FA), ECMO from the IVC to the carotid artery (IVC-CA) and ECMO with an additional return cannula to the internal jugular vein based on the femoral VA ECMO (FA-IJV).\n\n Angiography and blood gas analyses were performed.\n\n\nResults\nWith IVC-FA, blood oxygen saturation (SO2) of the IVC (83.6?±?0.8%) was higher than that of the SVC (40.3?±?1.0%).\n\n Oxygen-rich blood was drained back to the ECMO circuit and poorly oxygenated blood in the SVC entered the right atrium (RA).\n\n SVC-FA achieved oxygen-rich blood return from the IVC to the RA without shifting the arterial cannulation.\n\n Subsequently, SO2 of the SVC and the pulmonary artery increased (70.4?±?1.0% and 73.4?±?1.1%, respectively).\n\n Compared with IVC-FA, a lesser difference in venous oxygen return and attenuated differential hypoxia were observed with IVC-CA and FA-IJV.\n\n\nConclusions\nDifferential venous oxygen return is a key factor in the etiology of differential hypoxia in VA ECMO.\n\n With knowledge of this mechanism, we can apply better cannula configurations in clinical practice.\n\n\nElectronic

(VA?ECMO) is indicated in reversible life?threatening circulatory failure with or without respiratory failure.\n Arterial desaturation in the upper body is frequently seen in patients with peripheral arterial cannulation and severe respiratory failure.\n The importance of venous cannula positioning was explored in a computer simulation model and a clinical case was described.\n A closed?loop real?time simulation model has been developed including vascular segments, the heart with valves and pericardium.\n ECMO was simulated with a fixed flow pump and a selection of clinically relevant venous cannulation sites.\n A clinical case with no tidal volumes due to pneumonia and an arterial saturation of below 60% in the right hand despite VA?ECMO flow of 4 L/min was described.\n The case was compared with simulation data.\n Changing the venous cannulation site from the inferior to the superior caval vein increased arterial saturation in the right arm from below 60% to above 80% in the patient and from 64 to 81% in the simulation model without changing ECMO flow.\n The patient survived, was extubated and showed no signs of hypoxic damage.\n We conclude that venous drainage from the superior caval vein improves upper body arterial saturation during veno?arterial ECMO as compared with drainage solely from the inferior caval vein in patients with respiratory failure.\n The results from the simulation model are in agreement with the clinical scenario.\n","id":"PMC5297996","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

(ARDS), adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may decrease ventilator-induced lung injury by minimising overinflation and cyclic recruitment-derecruitment of the lung.\n\n We evaluated whether setting the PEEP using decremental PEEP titration after an alveolar recruitment manoeuvre (ARM) affects the clinical outcome in patients with ARDS.\n\n\nMethods\nFifty-seven patients with early ARDS were randomly assigned to a group given decremental PEEP titration following ARM or a table-based PEEP (control) group.\n\n PEEP and inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) in the control group were set according to the table-based combinations of FiO2 and PEEP of the ARDS network, by which we aimed to achieve a PEEP level compatible with an oxygenation target.\n\n In the decremental PEEP titration group, the oxygen saturation and static compliance were monitored as the patients performed the ARM along with the extended sigh method, which is designed to gradually apply and withdraw a high distending pressure over a prolonged period, and the decremental titration of PEEP.\n\n\nResults\nThe baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the control and decremental PEEP titration groups.\n\n Initial oxygenation improved more in the decremental PEEP titration group than in the control group.\n\n However, dynamic compliance, tidal volume and PEEP were similar in the two groups during the first week.\n\n The duration of use of paralysing or sedative agents, mechanical ventilation, stay in the intensive care unit and mortality at 28 days did not differ significantly between the decremental PEEP titration and control groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe daily decremental PEEP titration after ARM showed only initial oxygenation improvement compared with the

includes permissive hypercapnia, staircase recruitment manoeuvres (SRM) and low airway pressure with PEEP titration.\n\n\nMethod\nTwenty ARDS patients were randomised to treatment or ARDSnet control ventilation strategies.\n\n The treatment group received SRM with decremental PEEP titration and targeted plateau pressure &lt; 30 cm H2O.\n\n Gas exchange and lung compliance were measured daily for 7 days and plasma cytokines in the first 24 hours and on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 (mean ± SE).\n\n Duration of ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay (median and interquartile range) and hospital survival were determined.\n\n\nResults\nThere were significant overall differences between groups when considering plasma IL-8 and TNF-?.\n\n For plasma IL-8, the control group was 41% higher than the treatment group over the seven-day period (ratio 1.41 (1.11 to 1.79), P = 0.01), while for TNF-? the control group was 20% higher over the seven-day period (ratio 1.20 (1.01 to 1.42) P = 0.05).\n\n PaO2/FIO2 (204 ± 9 versus 165 ± 9 mmHg, P = 0.005) and static lung compliance (49.1 ± 2.9 versus 33.7 ± 2.7 mls/cm H2O, P &lt; 0.001) were higher in the treatment group than the control group over seven days.\n\n There was no difference in duration of ventilation (180 (87 to 298) versus 341 (131 to 351) hrs, P = 0.13), duration of ICU stay (9.9 (5.6 to 14.8) versus 16.0 (8.1 to 19.3) days, P =

We also provide a comprehensive discussion of the different analytic methods for analyzing and interpreting VFDs, including Student’s t tests and rank-sum tests, as well as competing risk regressions

the effect size of an intervention, a statistical test and measure of confidence with the ability to adjust for baseline factors and allow interim monitoring for trials.\n We emphasize that any

PRISM score prior to NB-BAL, observations at the time of NB-BAL and arterial blood gases, oxygenation index (OI), ventilator settings, haemodynamic variables and temperature taken at 1 h before, and 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL, were retrieved from the archived computerised database.\n Results: Median age was 7 months (IQR 2.8–43 months) and median weight was 5.5 kg (IQR 4–14 kg).\n Four (7%) patients exhibited significant immediate complications, requiring escalation of respiratory or haemodynamic support.\n Forty-two (70%) patients had complete data for calculation of OI; there was no significant change in median OI at 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL.\n However 5 (12%) of these patients experienced an increase in OI of between 10 and 45 at 1 h post NB-BAL, which returned to baseline at 6 h post NB-BAL.\n Complications did not correlate with any of the available variables: baseline OI, PRISM score or with deterioration at the time of the procedure, although it was observed that four out of the six patients with baseline OIs of greater than 20 experienced complications.\n Conclusion: Non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage in critically ill mechanically ventilated neonates and children is generally a well-tolerated procedure, but for some patients, in whom it was not possible to elucidate predictive factors, complications developed.\n All patients, particularly those with OIs of greater than 20, require careful monitoring during and after the procedure.\n","id":"PMC7095174","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer-Verlag","authors":[{"firstname":"Margarita","surname":"Burmester","email":"margivan@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Quen","surname":"Mok","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1097/PCC.0000000000000435","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nonpulmonary Treatments for Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Proceedings From the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1542/peds.2008-1987","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Functional Status Scale: new pediatric outcome measure","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3389/fped.2016.00051","date":"2016-05-02","title":"Relevant Outcomes in Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Studies","abstract":"Despite distinct epidemiology and outcomes, pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is often managed based on evidence extrapolated from treatment of adults.\n The impact of non-pulmonary processes on mortality as well as the lower mortality rate compared to adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) renders the utilization of short-term mortality as a primary outcome measure for interventional studies problematic.\n However, data regarding alternatives to mortality are profoundly understudied, and proposed alternatives, such as ventilator-free days, may be themselves subject to hidden biases.\n Given the neuropsychiatric and functional impairment in adult survivors of ARDS, characterization of these morbidities in children with PARDS is of paramount importance.\n The purpose of this review is to frame these challenges in the context of the existing pediatric literature, and using adult ARDS as a guide, suggest potential clinically relevant outcomes that deserve further investigation.\n The goal is to identify important areas of study in order to better define clinical practice and facilitate future interventional trials in PARDS.\n","id":"PMC4865511","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Nadir","surname":"Yehya","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neal J.","surname":"Thomas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/thorax.55.7.587","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pediatric origins of adult lung disease. 1.

Here we share our own ECMO:COVID-19 experience, and compare this with our previous experience of ECMO use in influenza patients. \nECMO is a resource-intensive, highly specialised, and expensive form of life support with the potential for significant complications with unknown benefits, in the management of COVID-19. Thus its clinical utility during the current pandemic has been uncertain. An early retrospective case series from China described the role of ECMO in COVID-19 as 'unpromising', with nearly half of patients treated with ECMO dying from septic shock and multiple organ failure. \nTo investigate this further, we describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 34 patients presenting with severe COVID-19 pneumonitis who received respiratory ECMO support during the COVID-19 pandemic to one of the commissioned UK respiratory ECMO centres. Single-centre, retrospective data collection was performed for all patients receiving respiratory ECMO support for severe respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the peak of the UK pandemic (1st April to 31st May 2020). Various ECMO-related and laboratory parameters were extracted and statistically compared between patients who died (n = 18) and those who survived (n = 16) using the t-test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and the Fisher-exact test for categorical variables. Correlation between duration on ECMO and laboratory parameters was assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.\nA total of 268 patients were referred for consideration of respiratory ECMO support in Leicester (patient eligible criteria are shown in Fig. S1). Of the 268 referrals, 38 were retrieved for consideration of ECMO. Thirty-four went on to receive ECMO support, with 4 patients managed with advanced conventional ventilatory support as part of the Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (SARF) pathway (Table S1).\nThe mean age of the 34 patients receiving ECMO support was 46 years (range: 28-58). The majority were male (27/34, 79%), with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 31.9 (range: 22.4-45), and most patients (88%) had at least one comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes or obesity).\nThe most frequently occurring COVID-19 symptoms in this patient group included fever (26/34, 76%), cough (25/34, 74%) and myalgia (10/34, 29%). Anosmia was a relatively uncommon finding, being recognised in only 2 patients (6%). Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups accounted for 59% (20/34) of patients, with 38% (13/34) of the cohort being healthcare workers. Co-morbid conditions were present in the majority of patients (30/34, 88%), with the most common being: obesity (23/34, 68%), hypertension (8/34, 24%) and diabetes (4/34, 12%).\nThe majority of patients had a dual-lumen cannula configuration of the right internal jugular vein (28/34, 82%), as is routine practice for our unit. Renal replacement therapy was initiated in 26% (9/34) of patients. The mean duration of ventilation prior to initiation of ECMO was 4.9 days (range: 2-8), and the mean duration of ECMO support was 13.2 days (range: 4-26). The survival to discharge in this cohort of patients was 53% (18/34).\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients on ECMO.\nTable 1	 	\n	Survivor	Died	p-value	 	Demographics	(n = 18)	(n = 16)		 	Age (years)	45.6 (6.7)	47.0 (8.4)	0.596	 	Sex - M	15 (83%)	12 (75%)	0.682	 	Ethnicity				 	Asian	8 (44%)	8 (50%)	0.893	 	Black	2 (11%)	2 (13%)		 	White	8 (44%)	6 (38%)		 	HCW	6 (33%)	7 (44%)	0.725	 	Medical history				 	Any comorbidity	17 (94%)	13 (81%)	0.323	 	Hypertension	6 (33%)	2 (13%)	0.233	 	Diabetes	3 (17%)	1 (6%)	0.604	 	Obese	15 (83%)	8 (50%)	0.066	 	Haematology and biochemistry parameters		 	White cell count (109/L)	14.1 (5.7)	10.5 (2.9)	0.027	 	Neutrophils (109/L)	12.3 (5.4)	9.1 (2.9)	0.035	 	Lymphocytes (109/L)	1.1 (0.4)	0.9 (0.5)	0.220	 	C-reactive protein (mg/L)	195.4 (113.0)	260.6 (95.5)	0.080	 	Haemoglobin (g/L)	105.3 (11.2)	103.4 (11.8)	0.623	 	LDH (IU/L)	656.4 (277.2)	603.5 (243.7)	0.684	 	ALT (IU/L)	51 (35 - 73)	47.5 (34 - 79)	0.931	 	GGT (IU/L)	154.5 (78.5 - 251)	104 (73 - 156)	0.097	 	AST (IU/L)	74 (59.5 - 85)	69 (65 - 94)	0.728	 	Total bilirubin (micromol/L)	13 (8 - 31)	10.5 (7 - 17.5)	0.284	 	Urea (mmol/L)	9.4 (6.7 - 13)	10.3 (7.4 - 15)	0.504	 	Na (mmol/L)	143.0 (4.6)	146.2 (4.2)	0.043	 	K (mmol/L)	5.3 (0.7)	4.8 (0.5)	0.045	 	Creatinine (micromol/L)	74.5 (52 - 190)	68 (45.5 - 124)	0.704	 	Troponin (ng/L)	15 (4 - 41)	29 (17 - 83)	0.142	 	BNP (pg/mL)	384 (253 - 566)	532 (341 - 1127)	0.365	 	D-dimers (ng/mL)	7.9 (3.3 - 9.6)	6.2 (3.5 - 18)	0.772	 	ECMO parameters			 	PaO2:FiO2 ratio	9.0 (7.3 - 10)	8.3 (7 - 9.8)	0.398	 	PEEP (cm H20)	12.8 (3.5)	13.8 (3.2)	0.373	 	Tidal volume (mL)	476.5 (78.3)	476.1 (154.6)	0.992	 	Respiratory rate (RR, bpm)	20.4 (4.3)	19.3 (5.3)	0.498	 	Peak RR (bpm)	32.9 (3.7)	32.3 (3.6)	0.612	 	pH	7.3 (0.1)	7.3 (0.1)	0.823	 	PaO2 (kPa)	7.9 (1.2)	8.0 (1.2)	0.689	 	PaCO2 (kPa)	7.7 (1.9)	9.6 (4.3)	0.112	 	Base excess (mmol/L)	2.4 (4.5)	3.0 (2.9)	0.702	 	Lactate (mmol/L)	1.5 (0.6)	1.5 (0.5)	0.911	 	Bicarbonate (HCO3, mmol/L)	27.2 (4.8)	28.7 (4.3)	0.409	 	MAP (mm Hg)	79.6 (12.1)	77.3 (10.7)	0.553	 	Days ventilated pre-ECMO	5.2 (1.8)	4.6 (1.7)	0.278	 	Days on ECMO	11.1 (4.9)	15.6 (5.6)	0.017	 	\nLDH - lactate dehydrogenase; ALT - alanine aminotransferase; GGT - gamma glutamyl transferase; AST - aspartate aminotransferase; BNP - brain natriuretic peptide; PEEP - positive end expiratory pressure; H2O - water; bpm - breaths per minute; PaO2/PaCO2 - partial pressure of arterial oxygen/carbon dioxide; MAP - mean arterial pressure; ECMO - extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.\n Table 1 compares COVID-19 patients who survived (18/34, 52.9%) versus those who died (16/34, 47.1%), with both groups being evenly matched with respect to demographic data and medical history.

Most significantly, severe influenza requiring ECMO support occurred more frequently in ethnically white (Caucasian) compared to the COVID-19 patients (p &lt;= 0.001). White cell count also appears significantly lower in the influenza cohort (5.8 vs. 12.4, p &lt;= 0.001). A significant proportion of the patients in the influenza group required renal replacement therapy (24/26, 92%), which was not seen in the COVID-19 patients. The number of days ventilated prior to initiation of ECMO was also significantly shorter in the influenza group (2.4 vs. 4.9, p &lt;= 0.001). More deaths were recognised in the COVID-19 group (47% vs. 31%), although this did not reach statistical significance.\nIn this single-site, retrospective observational cohort study, we present the data from 34 patients admitted to one of the six UK severe respiratory failure centres who received ECMO support for COVID-19 pneumonitis. Earlier speculation by some teams about the potential application of ECMO suggested that it may be useful in severe cases of COVID-19, though this would depend very much on case selection. This speculation has since been borne out by more recent reports on single  , small and larger   case series of patients with severe COVID-19, where the authors have been cautious about the potential benefits of ECMO in such patients, emphasising the limited capacity for this complex treatment.\nA recent ECMO consensus document states this succinctly as: &quot;ECMO is a highly technical therapy and is resource intensive. Although the distribution of this therapy should be as equitable as possible, during a pandemic such as COVID-19, distribution should focus on optimal candidates for recovery.&quot; \nIn our case series presented here, it is difficult to conclude exactly how much the ECMO therapy contributed to the survival of these severely ill COVID-19 patients versus if they only had standard intensive care unit (ICU) support, as it was not possible for each patient to act as his/her own control in this comparison.

pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, compared to those who are moderately ill.\n The high level of cytokines also indicates a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Besides, excessive infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells, mainly involving macrophages and T-helper 17 cells, has been found in lung tissues of patients with COVID-19 by postmortem examination.\n Recently, increasing studies indicate that the “cytokine storm” may contribute to the mortality of COVID-19. Here, we summarize the clinical and pathologic features of the cytokine storm in COVID-19. Our review shows that SARS-Cov-2 selectively induces a high level of IL-6 and results in the exhaustion of lymphocytes.\n The current evidence indicates that tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, is relatively effective and safe.\n Besides, corticosteroids, programmed cell death protein (PD)-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition, cytokine-adsorption devices, intravenous immunoglobulin, and antimalarial agents could be potentially useful and reliable approaches to counteract cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.\n","id":"PMC7365923","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Yujun","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiajia","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dingyi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhenghao","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jinjun","surname":"Ji","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chengping","surname":"Wen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.05.001","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Recognizing COVID-19–related myocarditis: The possible pathophysiology and proposed guideline for diagnosis and management","abstract":"Human coronavirus-associated myocarditis is known, and a number of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)–related myocarditis cases have been reported.\n The pathophysiology of COVID-19–related myocarditis is thought to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage due to the host’s immune response.\n COVID-19 myocarditis diagnosis should be guided by insights from previous coronavirus and other myocarditis experience.\n The clinical findings include changes in electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers, and impaired cardiac function.\n When cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is not feasible, cardiac computed tomographic angiography with delayed myocardial imaging may serve to exclude significant coronary artery disease and identify myocardial inflammatory patterns.\n Because many COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities, myocardial infarction should be considered.\n If the diagnosis remains uncertain, an endomyocardial biopsy may help identify active cardiac infection through viral genome amplification and possibly refine the treatment risks of systemic immunosuppression.\n Arrhythmias are not uncommon in COVID-19 patients, but the pathophysiology is still speculative.\n Nevertheless, clinicians should be vigilant to provide prompt monitoring and treatment.\n The long-term impact of COVID-19 myocarditis, including the majority of mild cases, remains unknown.\n","id":"PMC7199677","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Bhurint","surname":"Siripanthong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saman","surname":"Nazarian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniele","surname":"Muser","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rajat","surname":"Deo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pasquale","surname":"Santangeli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohammed Y.","surname":"Khanji","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leslie T.","surname":"Cooper","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"C.

(COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still not fully unraveled.\n Though preventive vaccines and treatment methods are out on the market, a specific cure for the disease has not been discovered.\n Recent investigations and research studies primarily focus on the immunopathology of the disease.\n A healthy immune system responds immediately after viral entry, causing immediate viral annihilation and recovery.\n However, an impaired immune system causes extensive systemic damage due to an unregulated immune response characterized by the hypersecretion of chemokines and cytokines.\n The elevated levels of cytokine or hypercytokinemia leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) along with multiple organ damage.\n Moreover, the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 has been linked with race, gender, and age; hence, this viral infection’s outcome differs among the patients.\n Many therapeutic strategies focusing on immunomodulation have been tested out to assuage the cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the diverse signaling pathways triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is essential before contemplating relief measures.\n This present review explains the interrelationships of hyperinflammatory response or cytokine storm with organ damage and the disease severity.\n Furthermore, we have thrown light on the diverse mechanisms and risk factors that influence pathogenesis and the molecular pathways that lead to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and multiple organ damage.\n Recognition of altered pathways of a dysregulated immune system can be a loophole to identify potential target markers.\n Identifying biomarkers in the dysregulated pathway can aid in better clinical management for patients with severe COVID-19 disease.\n A special focus has also been given to potent inhibitors of proinflammatory cytokines, immunomodulatory and immunotherapeutic options to ameliorate cytokine storm and inflammatory responses in patients affected with COVID-19.

we aimed to determine whether continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with oXiris filter may alleviate cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in non-AKI patients with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n A total of 17 non-AKI patients with severe and critical COVID-19 treated between February 14 and March 26, 2020 were included and randomly divided into intervention group and control group according to the random number table.\n Patients in the intervention group immediately received CRRT with oXiris filter plus conventional treatment, while those in the control group only received conventional treatment.\n Demographic data were collected and collated at admission.\n During ICU hospitalization, the concentrations of circulating cytokines and inflammatory chemokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-?, and IFN-?, were quantitatively measured daily to reflect the degree of CRS induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Clinical data, including the severity of COVID-19 white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil proportion (NEUT%), lymphocyte count (LYMPH), lymphocyte percentage (LYM%), platelet (PLT), C-reaction protein (CRP), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TB), albumin (ALB), serum creatinine (SCr), D-Dimer, fibrinogen (FIB), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-?, IFN-?, number of hospital days and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were obtained and collated from medical records, and then compared between the two groups.\n Age, and SCr significantly differed between the two groups.\n Besides the IL-2 concentration that was significantly lower on day 2 than that on day 1 in the intervention group, and the IL-6 concentrations that were significantly higher on day 1, and day 2 in the intervention group compared to the control group, similar to the IL-10 concentration on day 5, there were no significant differences between the two groups.\n To sum up, CRRT with oXiris filter may not effectively alleviate CRS in non-AKI patients with severe and critical COVID-19. Thus, its application in these patients should be considered with caution to avoid increasing the unnecessary burden on society and individuals and making the already overwhelmed medical system even more strained (IRB number: IRB-AF/SC-04).\n","id":"PMC8854969","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

surge worldwide, an urgent need exists to enhance our understanding of the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of severely ill patients with COVID-19 who develop acute respiratory and cardiac compromise refractory to conventional therapy.\n The purpose of this manuscript is to review our initial clinical experience in 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with ECMO.\n A multi-institutional registry and database was created and utilized to assess all patients who were supported with ECMO provided by SpecialtyCare.\n Data captured included patient characteristics, pre-COVID-19 risk factors and comorbidities, confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis, features of ECMO support, specific medications utilized to treat COVID-19, and short-term outcomes through hospital discharge.\n This analysis includes all of our patients with COVID-19 supported with ECMO, with an analytic window starting March 17, 2020, when our first COVID-19 patient was placed on ECMO, and ending April 9, 2020. During the 24 days of this study, 32 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were placed on ECMO at nine different hospitals.\n As of the time of analysis, 17 remain on ECMO, 10 died before or shortly after decannulation, and five are alive and extubated after removal from ECMO, with one of these five discharged from the hospital.\n Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: four of five survivors received intravenous steroids, three of five survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), two of five survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and one of five survivors received hydroxychloroquine.\n An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19. Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n These initial data may provide useful information to help define the best strategies to care for these challenging patients and may also provide a framework for much-needed future research about the use of ECMO to treat patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7217117","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins","authors":[{"firstname":"Jeffrey P.","surname":"Jacobs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alfred H.","surname":"Stammers","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James","surname":"St. Louis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J.

allows us to provide this life-saving therapy to our sickest patients without overburdening already stretched resources or excessively exposing healthcare staff to infection risk.\n\n\nMethods:\nAs a major regional referral program, we used the framework of our well-established ECMO service-line to outline specific team structures, modified patient eligibility criteria, cannulation strategies, and management protocols for the COVID-19 ECMO program.\n\n\nResults:\nDuring the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts, 6 patients were placed on VV ECMO for refractory hypoxemic

survival is 96.3%, with only 1 death to date in more than 350 days of total ECMO support.\n\n Thirteen patients (48.1%) remain on ECMO support, and 13 patients (48.1%) have been successfully decannulated.\n\n Seven patients (25.9%) have been discharged from the hospital.\n\n Six patients (22.2%) remain in the hospital, of which 4 are on room air.\n\n No health care workers who participated in ECMO cannulation developed symptoms of or tested positive for COVID-19.\nConclusions\nThe early outcomes presented here suggest that the judicious use of ECMO support in severe COVID-19 may be clinically beneficial.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7366119","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Published by

that rapidly evolve to profound hypoxaemia and death.\n\n The efficacy of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with severe ARDS in the context of COVID-19 is unclear.\n\n We aimed to establish the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with respiratory failure and COVID-19 treated with ECMO.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective cohort study was done in the Paris–Sorbonne University Hospital Network, comprising five intensive care units (ICUs) and included patients who received ECMO for COVID-19 associated ARDS.\n\n Patient demographics and daily pre-ECMO and on-ECMO data and outcomes were collected.\n\n Possible outcomes over time were categorised into four different states (states 1–4): on ECMO, in the ICU and weaned off ECMO, alive and out of ICU, or death.\n\n Daily probabilities of occupation in each state and of transitions between these states until day 90 post-ECMO onset were estimated with use of a multi-state Cox model stratified for each possible transition.\n\n Follow-up was right-censored on July 10, 2020.\nFindings\nFrom March 8 to May 2, 2020, 492 patients with COVID-19 were treated in our ICUs.\n\n Complete day-60 follow-up was available for 83 patients (median age 49 [IQR 41–56] years and 61 [73%] men) who received ECMO.\n\n Pre-ECMO, 78 (94%) patients had been prone-positioned; their median driving pressure was 18 (IQR 16–21) cm H2O and PaO2/FiO2 was 60 (54–68) mm Hg.\n\n At 60 days post-ECMO initiation, the estimated probabilities of occupation in each state were 6% (95% CI 3–14) for state 1, 18% (11–28) for state 2, 45% (35–56) for state 3, and 31% (22–42) for state 4. 35 (42%) patients had major bleeding and four (5%) had a haemorrhagic stroke.\n\n 30 patients died.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe estimated 60-day survival of ECMO-rescued patients with COVID-19 was similar to that of studies published in the past 2 years on ECMO for severe ARDS.\n\n If another COVID-19 outbreak occurs, ECMO should be considered for patients developing refractory respiratory failure despite optimised care.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7426089","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure.\n\n However, initial reports of ECMO use in patients with COVID-19 described very high mortality and there have been no large, international cohort studies of ECMO for COVID-19 reported to date.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry to characterise the epidemiology, hospital course, and outcomes of patients aged 16 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 who had ECMO support initiated between Jan 16 and May 1, 2020, at 213 hospitals in 36 countries.\n\n The primary outcome was in-hospital death in a time-to-event analysis assessed at 90 days after ECMO initiation.\n\n We applied a multivariable Cox model to examine whether patient and hospital factors were associated with in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nData for 1035 patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO support were included in this study.\n\n Of these, 67 (6%) remained hospitalised, 311 (30%) were discharged home or to an acute rehabilitation centre, 101 (10%) were discharged to a long-term acute care centre or unspecified location, 176 (17%) were discharged to another hospital, and 380 (37%) died.\n\n The estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 37·4% (95% CI 34·4–40·4).\n\n Mortality was 39% (380 of 968) in patients with a final disposition of death or hospital discharge.\n\n The use of ECMO for circulatory support was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 1·89, 95% CI 1·20–2·97).\n\n In the subset of patients with COVID-19 receiving respiratory (venovenous) ECMO and characterised as having acute respiratory distress syndrome, the estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 38·0% (95% CI 34·6–41·5).\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO, both estimated mortality 90 days after ECMO and mortality in those with a final disposition of death or discharge were less than 40%.\n\n These data from 213 hospitals worldwide provide a generalisable

On ICU admission, standard oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, and non-invasive ventilation were applied to 29%, 19%, and 6% patients, respectively.\n\n 2635 (63%) patients were intubated during the first 24 h whereas overall 3376 (80%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) at one point during their ICU stay.\n\n Median (IQR) positive end-expiratory and plateau pressures were 12 (10–14) cmH2O, and 24 (21–27) cmH2O, respectively.\n\n The mechanical power transmitted by the MV to the lung was 26.5 (18.6–34.9) J/min.\n\n Paralyzing agents and prone position were applied to 88% and 70% of patients intubated at Day-1, respectively.\n\n Pulmonary embolism and ventilator-associated pneumonia were diagnosed in 207 (9%) and 1209 (58%) of these patients.\n\n On day 90, 1298/4244 (31%) patients had died.\n\n Among patients who received invasive or non-invasive ventilation on the day of ICU admission, day-90 mortality increased with the severity of ARDS at ICU admission (30%, 34%, and 50% for mild, moderate, and severe ARDS, respectively) and decreased from 42 to 25% over the study period.\n\n Early independent predictors of 90-day mortality were older age, immunosuppression, severe obesity, diabetes, higher renal and cardiovascular SOFA score components, lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio and a shorter time between first symptoms and ICU admission.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Among more than 4000 critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to our ICUs, 90-day mortality was 31% and decreased from 42 to 25% over the study period.\n\n Mortality was higher in older, diabetic, obese and severe ARDS patients.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00134-020-06294-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to

influenza can cause severe acute lung injury (ALI).\n\n Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support gas exchange in patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial.\n\n We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on ECMO for H1N1-associated ALI.\n\n\nMethods\nCENTRAL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus (updated 2 January 2012) were systematically searched.\n\n Studies reporting on 10 or more patients with H1N1 infection treated with ECMO were included.\n\n Baseline, procedural, outcome and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled, when appropriate, with random-effect methods.\n\n\nResults\nFrom 1,196 initial citations, 8 studies were selected, including 1,357 patients with confirmed/suspected H1N1 infection requiring intensive care unit admission, 266 (20%) of whom were treated with ECMO.\n\n Patients had a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 9, and had received mechanical ventilation before ECMO implementation for a median of two days.\n\n ECMO was implanted before inter-hospital patient transfer in 72% of cases and in most patients (94%) the veno-venous configuration was used.\n\n ECMO was maintained for a median of 10 days.\n\n Outcomes were highly variable among the included studies, with in-hospital or short-term mortality ranging between 8% and 65%, mainly depending on baseline patient features.\n\n Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality of 28% (95% confidence interval 18% to 37%; I2 = 64%).\n\n\nConclusions\nECMO is feasible and effective in patients with ALI due to H1N1 infection.\n\n Despite this, prolonged support (more than one week) is required in most cases, and subjects with severe comorbidities or multiorgan failure remain at high risk of in-hospital death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4057025","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

extensively used for potentially reversible acute respiratory failure associated with severe influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia; however, it remains an expensive, resource-intensive therapy, with a high associated mortality.\n\n This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize and pool outcomes data available in the published literature to guide clinical decision-making and further research.\n\n\nMethods:\nWe conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE (1966 to April 15, 2015), EMBASE (1980 to April 15, 2015), CENTRAL, and Google Scholar for patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and respiratory failure who received ECMO.\n\n The study validity was appraised by Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.\n\n The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.\n\n The secondary outcomes were duration of ECMO therapy, mechanical ventilation, and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay.\n\n\nResults:\nOf 698 abstracts screened and 142 full-text articles reviewed, we included 13 studies with a total of 494 patients receiving ECMO in our final review and meta-analysis.\n\n The study validity was satisfactory.\n\n The overall mortality was 37.1% (95% confidence interval: 30–45%) limited by underlying heterogeneity (I2 = 65%, P value of Q statistic = 0.006).\n\n The median duration for ECMO was 10 days, mechanical ventilation was 19 days, and ICU length of stay was 33 days.\n\n Exploratory meta-regression did not identify any statistically significant moderator of mortality (P &lt; 0.05), except for the duration of pre-ECMO mechanical ventilation in days (coefficient 0.19, standard error: 0.09, Z = 2.01, P &lt; 0.04, R2 = 0.16).\n\n The visual inspection of funnel plots did not suggest the presence of publication bias.\n\n\nConclusions:\nECMO therapy may be used as an adjunct or salvage therapy for severe H1N1 pneumonia with respiratory failure.\n\n It is associated with a prolonged duration of ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and high mortality.\n\n Initiating ECMO early once the patient has been instituted on mechanical ventilation may result in improved survival.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5290688","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Medknow Publications

have symptoms that rapidly evolve to profound hypoxaemia and death.\n\n The efficacy of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with severe ARDS in the context of COVID-19 is unclear.\n\n We aimed to establish the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with respiratory failure and COVID-19 treated with ECMO.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective cohort study was done in the Paris–Sorbonne University Hospital Network, comprising five intensive care units (ICUs) and included patients who received ECMO for COVID-19 associated ARDS.\n\n Patient demographics and daily pre-ECMO and on-ECMO data and outcomes were collected.\n\n Possible outcomes over time were categorised into four different states (states 1–4): on ECMO, in the ICU and weaned off ECMO, alive and out of ICU, or death.\n\n Daily probabilities of occupation in each state and of transitions between these states until day 90 post-ECMO onset were estimated with use of a multi-state Cox model stratified for each possible transition.\n\n Follow-up was right-censored on July 10, 2020.\nFindings\nFrom March 8 to May 2, 2020, 492 patients with COVID-19 were treated in our ICUs.\n\n Complete day-60 follow-up was available for 83 patients (median age 49 [IQR 41–56] years and 61 [73%] men) who received ECMO.\n\n Pre-ECMO, 78 (94%) patients had been prone-positioned; their median driving pressure was 18 (IQR 16–21) cm H2O and PaO2/FiO2 was 60 (54–68) mm Hg.\n\n At 60 days post-ECMO initiation, the estimated probabilities of occupation in each state were 6% (95% CI 3–14) for state 1, 18% (11–28) for state 2, 45% (35–56) for state 3, and 31% (22–42) for state 4. 35 (42%) patients had major bleeding and four (5%) had a haemorrhagic stroke.\n\n 30 patients died.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe estimated 60-day survival of ECMO-rescued patients with COVID-19 was similar to that of studies published in the past 2 years on ECMO for severe ARDS.\n\n If another COVID-19 outbreak occurs, ECMO

The 28-day mortality rate did not significantly differ between COVID-19 (43.3%) and influenza patients (50%, p = 0.63). There was no significant difference considering the cumulative incidence of ECMO weaning, hospital discharge, and 3-month survival.

No difference in overall adverse events was observed between COVID-19 and influenza patients (70% vs. 95.5% respectively; p = 0.23). Despite differences in clinical presentation before V-V ECMO implantation, 28-day and 3-month mortality rate did not differ between COVID-19 and influenza patients. Considering the lack of specific treatment for COVID-19, V-V ECMO should be considered as a relevant rescue organ support.\nCoronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a betacoronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which may lead to severe lower respiratory tract infections. Since November 2019 and the first cases in Wuhan, China, this pandemic has infected over 25 million people around the world, killing more than 840,000 of them. Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 26% needed admission in intensive care units (ICU), of whom 88% needed mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Some of them, refractory to conventional care that included lung protective mechanical ventilation, required veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) assistance, as recommended by the extracorporeal life support organization (ELSO).\nIn a context of stressed health care systems and scarce resources, selecting patients most likely to benefit from V-V ECMO has been a tremendous challenge for physicians all over the world. Following early reports, concern was raised about high mortality rate in COVID-19 patients supported with V-V ECMO. However, more recent studies found that V-V ECMO may be useful in selected critically ill patients. Finally, the thrombotic complications, hyperinflammatory state, and lack of data on recovery rate complicated the assessment of the risk-benefit ratio.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, there is no specific comparison of COVID-19-related ARDS patients to a relevant and homogenous control cohort in order to confirm the relevancy of V-V ECMO in this setting. Influenza A/B-related ARDS is the most frequent and well-known viral refractory ARDS to date. In the absence of a randomized control trial to definitely settle the question, this population may be the most valuable control.\nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients with refractory ARDS requiring V-V ECMO to a retrospective cohort of influenza (A or B) patients supported by similar strategy. The secondary objective was to describe the main characteristics before cannulation, the outcomes, and the prevalence of adverse events in both populations.\nMaterial and Methods\nStudy Design\nWe retrospectively included all patients referred to the ICUs of Lille and Rouen University Hospitals, France, for severe ARDS due to COVID-19 or influenza, requiring V-V ECMO support, during at least 48 hours. Patients were included between January 1, 2014, and February 6, 2020, and between March 9, 2020, and May 6, 2020, for influenza and COVID-19, respectively. Viral infection diagnoses were confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR, Institut Pasteur, France), and multiplex RT-PCR for influenza A/B (AIIPlex Respiratory Pannel, Seegene, Republic of Korea) on respiratory samples. A 3-month follow-up was completed for all patients.\nPatients eligible for V-V ECMO had to fulfill ARDS criteria. Before publication of the EOLIA trial, indications for V-V ECMO were severe persistent hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 100 mm Hg) and hypercapnic respiratory acidosis with an inability to maintain a protective ventilation despite an optimal medical treatment, including neuromuscular blockade, prone positioning, protective ventilation, and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Since the EOLIA trial publication, physicians were strongly encouraged to rely upon its indications (PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 50 mm Hg during more than 3 hours or PaO2/FiO2&lt;80 mm Hg during more than 6 hours or pH&lt;7.25 with PaCO2&gt;60 mmHg during more than 6 hours, with the respiratory rate increased to 35 breaths per minute and mechanical ventilation settings adjusted to keep a plateau pressure of &lt;=32 cm of water) and to discuss early V-V ECMO implantation (i.e., before day-7 of mechanical ventilation). Contraindications for V-V ECMO implantation were an age older than 70 years and severe comorbidities (advanced respiratory or cardiac failure, Child Pugh class C cirrhosis, hematological malignancies, and metastatic cancer), prolonged cardiac arrest, and refractory multiorgan failure. However, the final decision was taken after multidisciplinary discussion.\nThis study was approved by our institutional review board. Patient data were anonymized before analysis, according to French national data protection authority, National Commission on Informatics and Liberty's recommendations, after authorization request N  DEC20-151.\nV-V ECMO Procedures\nCardiovascular surgeons were strongly encouraged to perform an ultrasound-guided percutaneous cannulation. Blood drainage with a large cannula (25-27 Fr) inserted into the common femoral vein, and returned through the right internal jugular vein (19 Fr) was recommended in first intention. Pump speed was adjusted to obtain a blood-oxygen saturation of 90% or more. Cannula position was guided by ultrasonography and verified by chest x-ray. For highly unstable patients in other regional hospitals, our mobile ECMO retrieval teams, comprising a cardiovascular surgeon and a perfusionist, were sent to the patient's bedside for ECMO cannulation. Once ECMO had been implanted, the patient was transferred to one of our high-volume specialized centers.\nAfter an initial bolus of 50-100 IU/kg, systemic anticoagulation was maintained using unfractioned heparin for a targeted anti-Xa activity between 0.2-0.3 UI/mL for the influenza group and a higher target of 0.3-0.5 UI/mL for COVID-19 patients due to early reports of high thrombotic complication rate. This objective was decreased in high risk of bleeding and hemorrhagic patients.\nUltraprotective mechanical ventilation targeting lower tidal volume, respiratory rate, and driving pressure was recommended for the first days of V-V ECMO initiation. Prone positioning under ECMO and early spontaneous breathing were left at the physician's discretion.\nData Collection\nData were collected from our electronic health records (IntelliSpace Critical Care and Anesthesia (ICCA), Philips Healthcare). The data before V-V ECMO cannulation included demographic characteristics (age and sex), comorbidities, laboratory tests, indication for V-V ECMO, mechanical ventilation parameters, adjuvant treatment, and prognostic scores. Outcomes (mortality rate, ECMO duration and weaning, catecholamine and mechanical ventilation free days, ICU and hospital length of stay) and adverse events (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, major bleeding, thrombotic complications, and acute kidney injury) were also recorded. Major bleeding was defined according to ELSO guidelines. Thrombotic complications included pulmonary embolism, cannula, membranous, and deep venous thrombosis. A KDIGO score of III defined acute renal failure.\nStatistical Analyses\nData were reported as median (interquartile range) for quantitative variables and numbers (percentage) for categorical variables. Between-group comparisons were done using Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test when the expected cell frequency was inferior to 5) for binary outcomes or by using Mann-Whitney U test for quantitative variables. No statistical comparisons were done for categorical variables with one modality frequency lower than 5. For censored outcomes (ECMO duration, ICU and hospital length of stay [LOS]), we used a competing risk survival analysis approach by estimating the cumulative incidence of ECMO weaning and hospital discharge alive considering death as competing event. Cumulative incidences were estimated by the Kalbfleisch and Prentice method and were compared between the 2 groups using the Gray's test. Finally, the 3-month overall survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and compared by using log-rank test. Statistical testing was performed at the 2-tailed alpha level of 0.05. Data were analyzed using the SAS software package, release 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nResults\nDuring the study period, 58 patients required a V-V ECMO assistance for ARDS related to influenza or COVID-19 pneumonia. Six patients (3 in the COVID-19 group and 3 in the influenza group) had an ECMO course shorter than 48 hours and were excluded from the analysis. Among the 52 remaining patients, 30 presented with COVID-19 and 22 had influenza infection (18 influenza A and 4 influenza B virus). The flow chart of the study is reported in Figure 1.\nFlow-chart of the study.\nPatient Characteristics\nMedian age of COVID-19 and influenza patients was similar (57 vs. 55 years; p = 0.62). Subjects were mostly male (38/52 [73.1%]) with no significant difference between groups (80 vs. 63.6% for COVID-19 and influenza respectively; p = 0.19). COVID-19 patients had more frequently a history of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia compared to the influenza group. At the time of V-V ECMO initiation, the median PaO2/FiO2 ratio was identical in patients with COVID-19 and influenza (69 [63-75] vs. 68 [56-81] mm Hg; p = 0.87) (Table 1). Bacterial coinfection was more frequent in influenza patients (31.8% vs. 6.7%). The median sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) scores of COVID-19 patients were 10 and 58, respectively, lower than the scores of 11 (p = 0.37) and 68 (p = 0.04) of influenza patients (Table 2).\nPatients' Characteristics at Veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (V-V ECMO) Initiation in COVID-19 and Influenza Patients\n	COVID-19 (n = 30)	Influenza (n = 22)	P	 	Demographics				 	 Age, years	57 (47-62)	55 (48-60)	0.62	 	 Men	24 (80.0)	14 (63.6)	0.19	 	Comorbidities				 	 Body mass index, kg/m2	33 (29-38)	30 (26-34)	0.05	 	 Hypertension	16 (53.3)	7 (31.8)	0.12	 	 Diabetes	10 (33.3)	2 (9.1)	0.04	 	 Dyslipidemia	7 (23.3)	1 (4.5)	0.12	 	 Smoking	1 (3.3)	5 (22.7)	0.07	 	 Coronary arterial disease	0 (0.0)	1 (4.5)	NA	 	 Asthma/COPD	3 (10.0)	2 (9.1)	1.00	 	 Chronic respiratory  insufficiency	0 (0.0)	2 (9.1)	NA	 	 Immunocompromised  condition	3 (10.0)	1 (4.5)	NA	 	Biological data at V-V ECMO initiation	 	 pH*	7.37 (7.32-7.41)	7.35 (7.27-7.43)	0.36	 	 PaO2/FiO2 , mmHg	69 (63-75)	68 (56-81)	0.87	 	 PaCO2 , mmHg*	52 (46-60)	45 (35-63)	0.27	 	 Lactates , mmol/L	1.3 (1.1-1.8)	1.8 (1.2-2.4)	0.08	 	 Creatinine , micromol/L	80 (62-194)	168 (80-230)	0.09	 	 Bilirubin||, micromol/L	12 (9-24)	12 (9-24)	0.96	 	 ASAT#, UI/L	65 (35-103)	79 (60-203)	0.06	 	 ALAT , UI/L	48 (31-73)	43 (33-100)	0.98	 	 Platelets**, 109/L	280 (242-352)	122 (60-239)	0.001	 	 aPTT , ratio	1.4 (1.2-1.8)	1.6 (1.2-1.7)	0.66	 	 Fibrinogen  , g/L	7.8 (7.2-9.2)	4.5 (3.5-6.2)	&lt;0.001	 	\nValues are number (%) or median (interquartile range).\n*4 missing values (1 in COVID-19 group).\n 3 missing values (1 in COVID-19 group).\n 5 missing values (1 in COVID-19 group).\n 8 missing values (3 in COVID-19 group).\n 2 missing values (1 in COVID-19 group).\n||3 missing values (2 in COVID-19 group).\n#4 missing values (3 in COVID-19 group).\n**2 missing values (0 in COVID-19 group).\n  14 missing values (6 in COVID-19 group).\nALAT ,  alanin aminotransferase; aPTT ,  activated partial thromboplastin time; ASAT ,  aspartate aminotransferase; COPD ,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; FiO2, fraction of inspired oxygen; NA, not applicable.\nVeno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (V-V ECMO) Indications, Adjuvant Treatments and Prognostic Scores in COVID-19 and Influenza Patients\n	COVID-19 (n = 30)	Influenza (n = 22)	P	 	Indication for V-V ECMO	 	 PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 50 mmHg	1 (3.4)	3 (15.0)	NA	 	 PaO2/FiO2 [50-80] mmHg	25 (86.2)	15 (75.0)	0.46	 	 pH &lt; 7.25 and  PaCO2 &gt; 60 mmHg*	5 (17.2)	4 (20.0)	1.00	 	 Other	1 (3.4)	1 (5.0)	NA	 	Mechanical ventilation data	 	 Time from MV to  V-V ECMO, days	6 (4 to 9)	3 (1 to 5)	0.004	 	 Tidal volume , ml/kg IBW	6.5 (5.7 to 6.9)	6.3 (6.0 to 6.8)	0.98	 	 Respiratory rate , bpm	30 (26 to 32)	30 (28 to 30)	0.98	 	 Plateau pressure , cmH2O	30 (26 to 31)	32 (28 to 36)	0.18	 	 PEEP , cmH2O	14 (12 to 16)	14 (9 to 16)	0.53	 	 Driving pressure , cmH2O	15 (13 to 20)	20 (12 to 24)	0.16	 	Treatment before V-V ECMO initiation	 	 Prone positioning	30 (100.0)	19 (86.4)	NA	 	 Neuromuscular blocking  agents	30 (100.0)	22 (100.0)	NA	 	 Glucocorticoids	4 (13.3)	2 (9.1)	1.00	 	 Inhaled nitric oxide	22 (73.3)	18 (81.8)	0.47	 	 Almitrine	10 (33.3)	1 (4.5)	0.02	 	 Norepinephrine	15 (50.0)	16 (72.7)	0.10	 	Prognostic scores before V-V ECMO initiation		 	 SAPS II	58 (37 to 64)	68 (52 to 83)	0.04	 	 SOFA	10 (7 to 12)	11 (8 to 13)	0.37	 	 PRESERVE	3 (2 to 3)	4 (2 to 6)	0.04	 	 RESP	1 (0 to 2)	2 (0 to 3)	0.73	 	 PRESET	5.5 (4 to 6)	5.5 (4 to 7)	0.41	 	\nValues are number (%) or median (interquartile range)\n*2 patients in COVID-19 group and 1 patient in influenza group had also PaO2/FiO2 [50-80] mmHg.\n 3 missing values (0 in COVID-19 group).\n 16 missing values (11 in COVID-19 group).\n 2 missing values (0 in COVID-19 group).\nIBW, ideal body weight; MV, mechanical ventilation; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure; PRESERVE score, PRedicting dEath for SEvere ARDS on VV-ECMO; PRESET score, PREdiction of Survival on ECMO Therapy score; RESP score, Respiratory Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Survival Prediction score; SAPS II, simplified acute physiology score; SOFA, sepsis-related organ failure assessment.\nThe main indication for V-V ECMO was hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 less than 80 mm Hg for more than 6 hours) refractory to optimal medical treatment in patients with COVID-19 (89.6%) and in patients with influenza (90%). Only 2 patients were placed under V-V ECMO for indication not included in EOLIA trial inclusion criteria. One COVID-19 patient was cannulated for pulmonary hypertension leading to acute right heart failure and foramen ovale reopening, while 1 influenza patient was implanted for low respiratory system compliance without respiratory acidosis. The median time from mechanical support to V-V ECMO was significantly lower in patients with influenza (3 [1-5] days) compared with patients with COVID-19 (6 [4-9] days; p = 0.004). There was no significant difference in mechanical ventilation parameters between the 2 groups before V-V ECMO initiation. Every patient received neuromuscular blocking agents and a large proportion of patients (94.2%) were prone-positioned before V-V ECMO implantation. Almitrine use was the only significant difference in medical management before V-V ECMO initiation (33.3% vs. 4.5% for COVID-19 and influenza patients respectively; p = 0.02) (Table 2).\nV-V ECMO Characteristics\nPatients with influenza had more percutaneous cannulation (100%) compared with patients with COVID-19 (76.7%, p = 0.03). The femorojugular configuration was mostly used (n = 50/52). Only one patient with influenza had a femorosubclavicular configuration and 1 patient with COVID-19 had a double lumen cannula in jugular position. Our mobile ECMO retrieval team brought back more influenza than COVID-19 patients (54.5% vs. 26.7%; p = 0.05).\nOutcomes and Adverse Effects\nThe 28-day and 3-month mortality rate did not significantly differ between COVID-19 patients (43.3% and 53.3%, respectively) and influenza patients (50%; p = 0.63 and 50%; p = 0.81, respectively) (Table 3). The 6-month mortality rate was still at 50% for influenza patient. There was no significant difference considering cumulative incidence of ECMO weaning (Figure 2A), hospital discharge (Figure 2B), and 3-month survival (Figure 2C). The median time on ECMO for patients alive at ICU discharge was 9 (6-13) days in 14 COVID-19 patients and 10 (6-14) days in 12 influenza patients (p = 0.67).\nComplications and outcomes in COVID-19 cases and controls treated by veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO)\n	COVID-19 (n = 30)	Influenza (n = 22)	P	 	Complication under V-V ECMO	25 (70.0)	21 (95.5)	0.23	 	 Ischemic stroke	1 (3.3)	0 (0.0)	NA	 	 Hemorrhagic stroke	3 (10.0)	5 (22.7)	0.26	 	 Acute kidney injury	15 (50.0)	12 (54.6)	0.75	 	 Blood stream infection	4 (13.3)	2 (9.1)	1.00	 	 Bleeding				 	  Overall	22 (73.3)	14 (63.6)	0.45	 	  Major bleeding	13 (43.3)	9 (40.9)	0.86	 	  Cannula insertion site	14 (46.7)	5 (22.7)	0.08	 	 Thrombosis				 	  Overall	10 (33.3)	3 (13.6)	0.11	 	  Deep venous thrombosis	3 (10.0)	3 (13.6)	0.69	 	  Pulmonary embolism	2 (6.7)	0 (0.0)	NA	 	  Oxygenator failure	6 (20.0)	0 (0.0)	0.03	 	  Oxygenator thrombosis	2 (6.7)	0 (0.0)	NA	 	Outcomes				 	 Mortality				 	  28-day	13 (43.3)	11 (50.0)	0.63	 	  Intensive Care Unit	16 (53.3)	10 (45.5)	0.57	 	  Hospital	16 (53.3)	10 (45.5)	0.57	 	 Catecholamine free days *, 	16 (8 to 26)	16 (11 to 30)	0.46	 	 Mechanical ventilation free  days  	3 (0 to 7)	4 (0 to 8)	0.91	 	 V-V ECMO duration, days	11 (7 to 14)	11 (6 to 19)	0.92	 	 V-V ECMO weaning	15 (50.0)	14 (63.6)	0.33	 	 Length Of Stay, days				 	   Intensive Care Unit	27 (20 to 39)	31 (22 to 38)	0.68	 	   Hospital	29 (21 to 47)	33 (23 to 45)	0.91	 	\nValues are number (%) or median (interquartile range).\n*Defined from ICU admission to ICU discharge.\n 1 missing value (0 in COVID-19 group).\n Defined from initiation of mechanical ventilation to ICU discharge.\nCumulative incidence of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation weaning (A), hospital discharge (B), and 3-month overall survival (C) in COVID-19 cases and controls (patients suffering Influenza A or Influenza B viral ARDS requiring V-V ECMO).\nNo difference in overall adverse events rate under V-V ECMO between COVID-19 and influenza patients was found (70.0 vs. 95.5%; p = 0.23). We observed a nonsignificant higher thrombosis event rate in COVID-19 group (33.3%) vs. influenza patients (13.6%; p = 0.11) with more pulmonary embolism, oxygenator failure, and oxygenator thrombosis. Despite a higher rate of bleeding event in COVID-19 patients, the occurrence of major bleeding was similar in both groups: 43.3% in patients with COVID-19 vs. 40.9% in patients with influenza (p = 0.86).\nDiscussion\nOur study is the first to compare SARS-CoV-2- and influenza-infected patients requiring V-V ECMO and to report a 3-month follow-up for COVID-19 patients. Mortality rate, cumulative incidence of survival, V-V ECMO weaning, hospital discharge, and adverse events rate were not different between the 2 populations.\nOn the one hand, according to SAPS II score, COVID-19 patients were less severe than the patients with influenza at V-V ECMO initiation, possibly because of a lower rate of bacterial coinfection. On the other hand, they presented more comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity, as previously reported in a general population of SARS-CoV-2 infected hospitalized patients. Moreover, COVID-19 patients were cannulated 3 days later than influenza patients while early cannulation (i.e., &lt;6 days of mechanical ventilation) could reduce mortality. The physician's decision to initiate V-V ECMO support may have been delayed in COVID-19 patients by the higher rate of almitrine infusion and prone positioning that could temporarily improve PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Despite all these differences, 28-day and 3-month mortality rate did not differ between the 2 groups.\nWe report here a retrospective cohort of influenza ARDS requiring V-V ECMO with a hospital-mortality rate of 45.5%, higher than the 27.6% reported in a previous metaanalysis. One of the most likely explanation could be the higher median age (55 years old vs. 39.7, 34.4, 36.5, and 42) and SOFA score (11 vs. 9) of our population in comparison with previous cohort studies. Our hospital-mortality rate of 53.3% in COVID-19 patients is consistent with the 46% provided by the ELSO registry on COVID-19 cases. Interestingly, the middle-term follow-up showed that all patients discharged from the hospital were still alive at 3 months. Recently, Schmidt et al. reported a 60-day mortality rate of 31% in 83 COVID-19 patients under V-V ECMO. As highlighted by the authors, this encouraging result could have several explanations: a large proportion of patients (79/83) were hospitalized in a very high volume center (Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital ICU), ultraprotective ventilation resulting in a drastic decrease in mechanical power and 81% of the patients were prone-positioned under V-V ECMO. Compare with our cohort, patients were younger (49 vs. 57 years old), were cannulated earlier (4 vs. 6 days), had a higher RESP Score (4 vs. 1), and a lower SAPS II score (45 vs 58). Furthermore, only 13/30 (43.3%) of our COVID-19 patients benefited from prone-positioning under V-V ECMO. It is also important to notice that we reported in-hospital mortality after a complete 3-month follow-up whereas the 36% hospital mortality reported by Schmidt et al. at 90 days account as alive the 18 patients lost in follow-up of the latest weeks.\nIn our cohort, RESP and PRESET scores seemed more accurate to predict survival or mortality compared to PRESERVE score. Our populations had a high proportion of obese patients (median BMI of 33 in patients with COVID-19), and obesity is known to increase mortality in patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 reduces the PRESERVE score because low BMI was associated with poor outcome. This could explain the gap between PRESERVE score predicted mortality and the observed one in our study. Anyway, prognostic scores before V-V ECMO initiation (i.e., PRESERVE, PRESET, RESP scores) must be used with caution in COVID-19 patients. Indeed, all these scores lack external validity to be used in COVID-19 patients (neither their derivation cohort nor their validation cohort had included these patients).\nOur data showed no between-groups difference in overall adverse events rate. However, we observed more thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients. This is consistent with previous data and could reflect the interplay between the hyperinflammatory state, the prothrombotic trend, and the pathophysiological adaptation to V-V ECMO of COVID-19 patients. The limited size of our population may also have underpowered this analysis. Larger scale analysis is needed to confirm this information. Moreover, as these thrombotic events occurred despite increased anticoagulation target, optimal anticoagulation strategy for COVID-19 patients is yet to be found.\nAmong the several limits of our study, the first is the limited size of our population and the retrospective setting resulting in underpowered analyses and exposing to confounders. Second, the statistical analysis performed to compare the characteristics of the patients at the time of cannulation or adverse events rate must be interpreted with caution regarding the small sample size in each group and the multiple testing issue. Only assumptions can be made about their meaning. Furthermore, our study was not designed to highlight differences in adverse events rate, especially for thrombotic complications adjusted on anticoagulant doses. Moreover, we can not exclude differences in ARDS management over the years. Centers' experience has certainly improved overtime, guidelines have been modified, and pivotal publications have recently emerged and modified further our practice. Of note most patients (14/22) in the influenza group were admitted in less than 15 months before the COVID-19 outbreak, limiting the effect of this possible bias. The other controls were included in the 5 years preceding the COVID outbreak (1 patient in 2014, 4 patients in 2016, 3 patients in 2017). Due to the small size sample of our cohort, we could not perform subgroup statistical analyses to assess for ARDS management discrepancies before V-V ECMO cannulation. Nevertheless, the use of prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade, in accordance with PROSEVA and ACURASYS trials results, seemed to be the same over the years. Finally, the pandemic setting and overstressed ICU resources might have distorted our results. However, we provide here a first comparative study of COVID-19 and influenza ARDS requiring V-V ECMO with a complete 3 months follow-up.\nConclusions\nWe compared for the first time SARS-CoV-2 and influenza patients requiring V-V ECMO for refractory ARDS and observed no difference in 28-day and 3-month mortality rates. The cumulative incidence of ECMO weaning and hospital discharge were also similar among groups, as were overall adverse events. Considering the lack of specific treatment for COVID-19, V-V ECMO should be considered as a relevant rescue organ support as a bridge to lung recovery or lung transplant.\nLille Intensive Care COVID-19 group:\nPauline Boddaert,* Morgan Caplan,* Guillaume Degouy,* Ahmed El Kalioubie,* Raphael Favory,* Bruno Garcia Patrick Girardie,* Marion Houard,* Emmanuelle Jaillette,* Merce Jourdain,* Geoffrey Ledoux,* Daniel Mathieu,* Anne Sophie Moreau,* Christopher Niles,* Saad Nseir,* Thierry Onimus,* Erika Parmentier-Decrucq,* Julien Poissy,* Sebastien Preau,* Laurent Robriquet,* Anahita Rouze,* Arthur Simonnet,* Sophie Six,* Aurelia Toussaint,* Jerome Soquet,  Valentin Loobuyck,  Andre Vincentelli,  Guillaume Gantois,** Christophe Decoene,** Slimane Ait Ouarab,** andVincent Liu**\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are indebted to thank all the perfusionist of the department of cardiovascular surgery and the whole members of the Lille Intensive Care COVID-19 Group.\nA list of &quot;Lille Intensive Care COVID-19 Group&quot; is given in &quot;Acknowledgments&quot; footnote.\nDisclosure: The authors have no conflicts of interest to report.\nThis study was supported by the French government through the Programme Investissement d'Avenir (I-SITE ULNE / ANR-16-IDEX-0004 ULNE) managed by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (&quot;PHYSIO-COVID&quot; project).\nN.C. and C.B. share cofirst authorship to this work.

ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

patients.\n\n Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included.\n\n Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected.\n\n Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points).\n\n Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%).\n\n 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting.\n\n Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO.\n\n Most patients (&gt;?95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen.\n\n No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant.\n\n Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n?=?145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n?=?77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs.\n\n 2.1%, p?&lt;?0.008).\n\n Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications.\n\n Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary

syndrome (SIRS) has been losing its prognostic power.\n\n Since the SIRS category is no longer used for the diagnosis of sepsis, the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) diagnostic criteria released by Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) should be modified.\n\n Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the appropriateness of replacing the SIRS score with antithrombin activity in JAAM-DIC diagnostic criteria.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analyzed data from 819 septic patients who had received recombinant thrombomodulin.\n\n The relationships between the 28-day mortality rate and baseline laboratory and clinical parameters were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses, and the impact of replacing the SIRS criteria with antithrombin activity was evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nThe SIRS score, prothrombin time ratio, and antithrombin activity were associated with the 28-day mortality rate (P values?=?0.013, 0.018, and 0.003, respectively, by multivariate analysis).\n\n A modified version of the JAAM-DIC diagnostic criteria using an antithrombin activity &lt;70 % was capable of diagnosing the identical number (n?=?706) and a similar severity of patients (mortality, 34.6 % versus 34.8 %).\n\n\nConclusion\nSince anticoagulant therapy is expected to be more effective in patients with more severe coagulation disorders, the modified version of the JAAM-DIC diagnostic criteria might be useful for discriminating patients with sepsis who are good candidates for anticoagulant therapy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5024432","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a model pathogen.\n We utilized a time course of matched virologic, pathological, and transcriptomic data within a novel methodological framework that can detect pathway enrichment among key highly connected network genes.\n This unbiased approach produced a high-priority list of 4 genes in one pathway out of over 3,500 genes that were differentially expressed following SARS-CoV infection.\n With these data, we predicted that the urokinase and other wound repair pathways would regulate lethal versus sublethal disease following SARS-CoV infection in mice.\n We validated the importance of the urokinase pathway for SARS-CoV disease severity using genetically defined knockout mice, proteomic correlates of pathway activation, and pathological disease severity.\n The results of these studies demonstrate that a fine balance exists between host coagulation and fibrinolysin pathways regulating pathological disease outcomes, including diffuse alveolar

reversible refractory hypoxemia from January 2009 until April 2011 in a tertiary Australian centre.\n\n Survival and long-term quality of life assessment, using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and the EuroQol health related quality of life questionnaire (EQ5D) were assessed and compared to international data from other research groups.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-one patients (mean age 36.3 years) with ARDS receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia were studied.\n\n Eighteen (86%) patients were retrieved from external intensive care units (ICUs) by a dedicated ECMO retrieval team.\n\n Eleven (55%) had H1N1 influenza A-associated pneumonitis.\n\n Eighteen (86%) patients survived to hospital discharge.\n\n Of the 18 survivors, ten (56%) were discharged to other hospitals and 8 (44%) were discharged directly home.\n\n Sequelae and health related quality of life were evaluated for 15 of the 18 (71%) long-term survivors (assessment at median 8 months).\n\n Mean SF-36 scores were significantly lower across all domains compared to age and sex matched Australian norms.\n\n Mean SF-36 scores were lower (minimum important difference at least 5 points) than previously described ARDS survivors in the domains of general health, mental health, vitality and social function.\n\n One patient had long-term disability as a result of ICU acquired weakness.\n\n Only 26% of survivors had returned to previous work levels at the time of follow-up.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis ARDS cohort had a high survival rate (86%) after use of ECMO support for reversible refractory hypoxemia.\n\n Long term survivors had similar physical health but decreased mental health, general health, vitality and social function compared to other ARDS survivors and an unexpectedly poor return to work.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3682304","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Carol

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) could represent an important treatment option, if complications were reduced by new technical developments.\n\n\nMethods\nEfficiency, side effects and outcome of treatment with a new miniaturized device for veno-venous extracorporeal gas transfer were analysed in 60 consecutive patients with life-threatening respiratory failure.\n\n\nResults\nA rapid increase of partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) from 64 (48 to 86) mmHg to 120 (84 to 171) mmHg and a decrease of PaCO2 from 63 (50 to 80) mmHg to 33 (29 to 39) mmHg were observed after start of the extracorporeal support (P &lt; 0.001).\n\n Gas exchange capacity of the device averaged 155 (116 to 182) mL/min for oxygen and 210 (164 to 251) mL/min for carbon dioxide.\n\n Ventilatory parameters were reduced to a highly protective mode, allowing a fast reduction of tidal volume from 495 (401 to 570) mL to 336 (292 to 404) mL (P &lt; 0.001) and of

if unchecked this may result in inflammation and organ injury.\n Here, we review the pathophysiology of the inflammatory response to ECMO, highlighting the complex interactions between arms of the innate immune response, the endothelium and coagulation.\n An understanding of the processes involved may guide the design of therapies and strategies aimed at ameliorating inflammation during ECMO.\n Likewise, an appreciation of the potentially deleterious inflammatory effects of ECMO may assist those weighing the risks and benefits of therapy.\n","id":"PMC5125043","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Jonathan E.","surname":"Millar","email":"j.millar@doctors.org.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jonathon P.","surname":"Fanning","email":"jonathon_fanning@me.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charles I.","surname":"McDonald","email":"Charles.McDonald@health.qld.gov.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel F.","surname":"McAuley","email":"d.f.mcauley@qub.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John F.","surname":"Fraser","email":"John.Fraser@health.qld.gov.au","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/0267659119830012","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effect of ex vivo extracorporeal membrane oxygenation flow dynamics on immune response","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMra1208623","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe sepsis and septic shock","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1473-3099(07)70265-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Host-pathogen interactions in sepsis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/s13054-014-0699-2","date":"2014-11-27","title":"The efficacy and safety of plasma exchange in patients with sepsis and septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Introduction\nSepsis and septic shock are leading causes of intensive care unit (ICU) mortality.\n\n They are characterized by excessive inflammation, upregulation of procoagulant proteins and depletion of natural anticoagulants.\n\n Plasma exchange has the potential to improve survival in sepsis by removing inflammatory cytokines and restoring deficient plasma proteins.\n\n The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plasma exchange in patients with sepsis.\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, reference lists of relevant articles, and grey literature for relevant citations.\n\n We included randomized controlled trials comparing plasma exchange or plasma filtration with usual care in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock.\n\n Two reviewers independently identified trials, extracted trial-level data and performed risk of bias assessments using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.\n\n The primary outcome was all-cause mortality reported at longest follow-up.\n\n Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1,957 records identified, we included four unique trials enrolling a total of 194 patients (one enrolling adults only, two enrolling children only, one enrolling adults and children).\n\n The mean age of adult patients ranged from 38 to 53 years (n?=?128) and the mean age of children ranged from 0.9 to 18 years (n?=?66).\n\n All trials were at unclear to high risk of bias.\n\n The use of plasma exchange was not associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.52, I2 60%).\n\n In adults, plasma exchange was associated with reduced mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96;

Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is therefore considered a rescue therapy to be used in the most severe ARDS, as recommended by the World Health Organization's interim guidelines for the management of patients with COVID-19. However, without a significant impact on mortality, the benefit of ECMO in ARDS remains controversial. Generally, only few data on the use of ECMO in the present pandemic are available with a short follow-up. However, accurately selecting patients with COVID-19-related ARDS, who may be good candidates for ECMO support, is important during a pandemic characterized by limited medical resources.\nMethods\nWe prospectively included all patients referred to the five ICUs of the Strasbourg University Hospital, between March 3 and April 1, 2020, for severe ARDS due to COVID-19 (confirmed by RT-PCR test), and that had been supported by ECMO after failure of optimal medical treatment, including neuromuscular blocking agents, protective ventilation, and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). According to EOLIA (ECMO to Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS) criteria, patients were eligible for ECMO if they developed a refractory ARDS defined by a PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 80 mm Hg or a pH &lt; 7.25 with a PaCO2 &gt; 60 mm Hg for more than 6 hours with a FiO2 &gt; 80%, despite low-pressure ventilation strategies and no participation of fluid overload. The contraindications for ECMO implantation were an age older than 70 years and severe comorbidities, including severe chronic respiratory failure, severe cardiac failure, and Child Pugh C cirrhosis. Invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days was a relative contraindication.\nThis study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the Strasbourg University Hospital (ClinicalTrials ID: NCT04343404). Informed consent was waived as part of a public health outbreak investigation. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) was used for all statistical analyses. Continuous variables are presented as median and ranges and were compared using nonparametric signed rank tests.\nResults\nSeventeen patients (4.5% of all those with ARDS admitted to our hospital's ICUs during the study period, n = 377) were supported by ECMO. The clinical presentation, ICU therapies, and outcomes are shown in Table 1. At the time of ECMO implantation, median PaO2/FiO2 was 71 (52-134) mm Hg and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 8 (3-15). Sixteen patients had been prone positioned before ECMO implantation.\nClinical Presentation and Clinical Outcomes of ECMO Patient Population (N = 17)\nCharacteristics	Patients (N = 17)	 	Age, yr	56 (30-76)	 	Sex, M	16 (94.1)	 	Obesity	10 (58.8)	 	Hypertension	9 (52.9)	 	Diabetes	3 (17.6)	 	Antiviral treatment	 	 	 Lopinavir-ritonavir	9 (52.9)	 	 Hydroxychloroquine	8 (47.1)	 	Corticosteroid	8 (47.1)	 	Days of ventilation before ECMO implantation	4 (1-17)	 	SOFA score at implantation	8 (3-15)	 	Respiratory parameters and adjunctive therapeutics at ECMO implantation	 	 	 Neuromuscular blockade	17 (100)	 	 Prone positioning session before implantation	16 (94.1)	 	 Inhaled nitric oxide	5 (29.4)	 	 FiO2, %	100 (50-100)	 	 PaO2/FiO2 ratio, mm Hg	71 (52-134)	 	 SaO2, %	90 (79-99)	 	 Vt, ml/kg of predicted body weight	5.9 (3.5-7.1)	 	 Respiratory rate, breaths/min	31 (20-35)	 	 PEEP, cm of water	14 (11-16)	 	 Plateau pressure, cm of water	29 (20-37)	 	 Driving pressure, cm of water	15 (7-23)	 	 Compliance, ml/cm of water	26 (17-55)	 	 Oxygenation index, cm of water/mm Hg	29 (14-39)	 	Respiratory parameters under ECMO	 	 	 SaO2, %	97 (92-100)	 	 Vt, ml/kg of predicted body weight	3.9 (1.7-6.1)	 	 Respiratory rate, breaths/min	20 (10-26)	 	 PEEP, cm of water	12 (8-16)	 	 Plateau pressure, cm of water	26 (20-39)	 	 Driving pressure, cm of water	14 (8-23)	 	 Prone positioning session during ECMO	0	 	 Anticoagulation with unfractioned heparin	17 (100)	 	Respiratory parameters at ECMO weaning	 	 	 PaO2/FiO2 ratio, mm Hg	177 (53-281)	 	 PEEP, cm of water	10 (5-15)	 	 Plateau pressure, cm of water	26 (12-31)	 	 Driving pressure, cm of water	15.5 (4-24)	 	 Compliance, ml/cm of water	29.5 (11-61)	 	 Oxygenation index, cm of water/mm Hg	10 (5-25)	 	Evolution at follow-up	 	 	 Mortality at day 60	6 (35.3)	 	 ICU discharge at day 60	10 (58.8)	 	Adverse effect under ECMO	 	 	 Hemorrhagic shock	1 (5.9)	 	 Bleeding leading to transfusion	6 (35.3)	 	 Transfusion of packed red blood cells, units	4 (0-26)	 	 Thrombopenia leading to transfusion	1 (5.9)	 	 Cardiac tamponade	1 (5.9)	 	 Stroke	1 (5.9)	 	 Thrombophlebitis or pulmonary embolism	3 (17.6)	 	 Oxygenator thrombosis	2 (11.8)	 	 Ventilator-associated pneumonia treated with antibiotics	10 (58.8)	 	 Renal replacement therapy	12 (70)	 	 Gas embolism	0	 	\nDefinition of abbreviations: ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure; SOFA = Sequential Organ Failure Assessment.\nData are reported as either median (range) or n (%). Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding. Obesity is defined by a body mass index (weight divided by the square of the height) &gt;=30 kg/m2. Organ failure was assessed with the SOFA on a scale from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more severe organ failure. The driving pressure is the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP. The compliance is the Vt divided by the driving pressure. The oxygenation index is mean airway pressure x FiO2 x 100/PaO2. Hemorrhagic shock was defined as hemorrhage leading to more than five units of packed red cells during 1 day and associated with hypotension.\nSixteen patients were supported with VV-ECMO (12 Avalon cannula and 4 jugulofemoral cannulations). One was supported with venoarterial femorofemoral ECMO because of respiratory failure complicated by cardiogenic shock due to pulmonary embolism. All patients were eligible for ECMO because of a PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 80 mm Hg (n = 16) or blood pH of &lt;7.25 with a PaCO2 of at least 60 mm Hg for more than 6 hours (n = 1). The median blood flow was 4 (0-6) L/min. In accordance with the French Society of Hematology's recommendations for patients with COVID-19, all patients were treated with therapeutic dosing of unfractioned heparin (anti-Xa 0.5-0.7 UI/ml).\nAfter ECMO implantation, the median Vt was significantly decreased from 5.9 to 3.9 ml/kg (P &lt; 0.01) and PEEP from 14 to 12 cm of water (P &lt; 0.02) with a lower plateau pressure: 26 (12-31) versus 29 (20-37) cm H2O (P &lt; 0.05). The median duration under ECMO was 9 (0-16) days. After weaning ECMO, the median oxygenation index decreased compared with the day of ECMO implantation (10 [5-25] vs. 29 [14-39] cm H2O/mm Hg; P = 0.01), indicating better oxygenation. Compliance also increased from 26 (17-55) to 29.5 (11-61) ml/cm H2O (P = 0.05).\nUnder ECMO, six patients had bleeding complications requiring transfusion. Most of the complications (in 5/6 patients, 83.3%) were due to bleeding at site of cannula insertion, and one was the result of a gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite therapeutic dosing of unfractioned heparin, we observed three oxygenator thromboses in two patients, and four patients developed thrombotic or ischemic complications under ECMO (Table 1).\nAt day 60, six patients (35.3%) had died and only one (5.9%) patient was still in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation. All 10 (58.8%) patients discharged from the ICU were weaned from mechanical ventilation, and among them, 7 (41.1%) patients were discharged from the hospital (Figure 1).\nOutcomes for individual patients included in the case series. After 60 days of follow-up, six patients (35.3%) had died. All survivors except one had been weaned from mechanical ventilation and discharged from the ICU. Three (17.6%) patients were still hospitalized, and seven patients were discharged from the hospital (*). ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\nDiscussion\nVV-ECMO facilitated protective ventilation with decreased plateau pressure, respiratory rate, and Vt in patients with COVID-19 with refractory ARDS. Compared with the EOLIA study, only a single patient was cannulated for indication related to pressure and the ECMO duration was shorter overall, which might be linked to the specificity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced lung damages. To date, according to our usual strategy, no more prone positioning procedure was realized under ECMO, the pandemic-induced work overload being also a limitation.\nECMO support is associated with an increased risk of both thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. Considering the high risk of thrombotic complications in patients with severe COVID-19, we chose higher anticoagulation targets for all of our patients than usual, even if most of them were under VV-ECMO. Indeed, a high proportion of patients with COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications. In an autopsy series, most of the patients were diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolisms. Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that despite anticoagulation, patients with ARDS related to COVID-19 developed more thrombotic complications, secondary to the major systemic inflammatory response along with endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, although 35.3% of the patients required blood transfusion, only one (5.8%) has developed hemorrhagic shock. Considering the high risk of thrombotic events in patients with COVID-19, we suggest that a therapeutic anticoagulation may be considered. Otherwise, despite higher targets of anticoagulation, we failed to prevent oxygenator thrombosis, requiring an urgent switch of the circuit. Indeed, only 7% of the circuits were changed in the EOLIA study because of clotting, compared with 12% in our cohort. Thus, the thrombotic complications seem to be more life-threatening than the hemorrhagic ones.\nConsidering the high frequency of severe adverse events, ECMO should probably remain a rescue therapy and therefore be undertaken only in ECMO-expert centers with adequate resources. In our cohort, one patient did indeed die during cannulation secondary to a cardiac tamponade.\nThe main strength of our study is to prospectively describe the clinical course of patients with COVID-19 who required ECMO, particularly as only few data are available. Our results are however limited by their single-center character.\nIn conclusion, although VV-ECMO is burdened with a high rate of life-threatening complications, it might be considered as a rescue therapy in refractory COVID-19 ARDS. In addition, an adequate higher level of therapeutic anticoagulation than usual should probably be considered.\nSupported by grants from the Strasbourg University Hospital (Les Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Direction de la Recherche Clinique et des Innovations).\nAuthor Contributions: P.-E.F. and F.M. had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","abstract":"WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown.\n Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO.\n The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally.\n Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges.\n Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan.\n ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre.\n Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access.\n ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and

and baseline laboratory and clinical parameters were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses, and the impact of replacing the SIRS criteria with antithrombin activity was evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nThe SIRS score, prothrombin time ratio, and antithrombin activity were associated with the 28-day mortality rate (P values?=?0.013, 0.018, and 0.003, respectively, by
