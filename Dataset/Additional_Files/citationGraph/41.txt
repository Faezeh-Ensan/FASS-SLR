As an important addition, we also introduce our newly funded project for the Guide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY (GtoImmuPdb, www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org). This has been 'forked' from the well-established GtoPdb data model and expanded into new types of data related to the immune system and inflammatory processes. This includes new ligands, targets, pathways, cell types and diseases for which we are recruiting new IUPHAR expert committees. Designed as an immunopharmacological gateway, it also has an emphasis on potential therapeutic interventions.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology/British Pharmacological Society IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (GtoPdb, www.guidetopharmacology.org) is an expert-curated resource of ligand-activity-target relationships, selected from high-quality pharmacological and medicinal chemistry literature. It has its origins in IUPHAR-DB, first compiled in 2003 and focused on receptors and channels. From 2012 to 2015, the scope expanded to define the data-supported druggable genome and the resource was re-named GtoPdb. This phase added many new target families and consolidated ligand-to-target relationships for approved drugs and clinical candidates. Over the last 2 years, under the guidance of the IUPHAR Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug Classification (NC-IUPHAR) and its 96 expanded subcommittees (comprising 512 international scientists), we have added quantitative ligand-target relationships showing promise for future drug discovery. We have also enhanced interoperability with other resources and added features to help users access structure-activity relationship (SAR) data and to explore species differences using a new ligand activity visualization tool.\nFrom 2015, we have addressed the priority area of immunity, inflammation and infection. Most chronic diseases, including ageing, have an immune-inflammatory component; auto-immunity is a serious problem, and the progress of infections depends on immune and inflammatory responses. There is also increased interest in anti-tumour immune activity, the importance of which is underlined by a new partnership between IUPHAR and the International Union of Immunological Sciences (IUIS) to create standard tools and nomenclature. Critical to facilitate this is a strong connection between the immunity, inflammation and infection research and the pharmacological communities, with easy bidirectional data flow. In particular, pharmacological information is difficult for immunologists to access without chemoinformatic expertise not typically present in immunology labs. Immunology is supported by excellent databases:e.g. ImmPort (www.immport.org), ImmGen (www.immgen.org), InnateDB (www.innatedb.ca/), Reactome (www.reactome.org) and IMGT (www.imgt.org):but these do not provide easy links to pharmacological data. The development of the 'IUPHAR Guide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY' (or GtoImmuPdb for short), with an immunologist-friendly portal, aims to address this gap in information exchange. All data added for the immunopharmacology project are also available from the original GtoPdb site and vice versa.\nGUIDE TO PHARMACOLOGY CURATION AND EXPANSION\nThe value of the database arises from our approach to document selection, data curation and annotation. Our curation 'rules' are better seen as flexible guidelines because expert judgement is exercised at all stages of the process, with the overriding pragmatic principle being to expand content value while maintaining stringency. This quality-centric, 'small data' approach contrasts with automated data-mining, large-scale curation operations and 'big data' amalgamation efforts. Curation includes checking and fixing author errors (e.g. muM versus nM), adding PubChem cross-pointers between unresolved stereoisomers to the appropriate stable R and S forms, and splitting salts and parents for cheminformatic consistency while also cross-pointing to reported salt forms (e.g. specified by the United States Adopted Names (USAN) or Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug information sheet). We have recently simplified the representation of activity ranges to one-value-one-reference relationships, extending this principle for patent-only entries and adapting legacy data to this form.\nContent\nTargets\nRIG-I-like receptor family (www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=940)\nAbsent in melanoma-like receptors (www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=942)\nC-type lectin-like receptors (www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=945)\nOther pattern recognition receptors (www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=929)\nA 'target' record in our database resolves to a UniProtKB/SwissProt Accession as its primary identifier. Since our 2016 publication, target expansion has been mainly for GtoImmuPdb. Specifically-added immunity, inflammation and infection targets include the following the pattern recognition receptors/proteins of the innate immune response: \nImmune checkpoint protein targets have been expanded and aggregated in new families, for example Immune checkpoint catalytic receptors (www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=953) and 'Other immune checkpoint proteins' (www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=949). This allows us to capture the action of these proteins as both immune system regulators and as drug targets. Another new target family is Butyrophilin and butyrophilin-like proteins were added for their increasingly indicated roles in gamma-delta T cells. As part of our ongoing updates of the GtoPdb, we have added other, non-immune targets, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and Piezo channels.\nOur targets are organized into several classes (Table 1A), accessible through the website, each divided into families and subfamilies (Figure 1). Classifications can overlap, for example 'Immune checkpoint proteins' are in both the 'Catalytic receptor' and the 'Other protein target' classes. Joining these different target types is useful to immunologists, given the proteins' shared roles in regulating T cells and macrophages.\nThe hierarchical listing for the catalytic receptor families and subfamilies. (A) Shows the GtoPdb view and (B) shows it with the Guide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY (GtoImmuPdb) view switched on, which highlights families containing targets of immunological relevance. A toggle button enables switching between GtoPdb and GtoImmuPdb views, the only difference being that the GtoPdb view does not have highlighting.\nGuide to PHARMACOLOGY database counts for targets, ligands and interactions from database release 2017.5\n	GtoPdb 2016	GtoPdb 2018 (+-2016)	GtoImmuPdb 2018	 	A.

Thirty-four of these are complexes (only subunits have UniProtKB accessions, and 1 that only has a mouse accession).\n*** Primary target indicates the dominant Molecular Mechanism of Action (MMOA)\n**** An interaction is only considered part of GtoImmuPdb where both the target and ligand are tagged as relevant to immunopharmacology. The table shows just under one quarter of all the curated interactions in GtoPdb involve targets and ligands of immunological relevance (we are still in the process of identifying these so it is likely to increase).\nThe table includes a comparison to the figures from the 2016 update, and a breakdown for the GtoImmuPdb dataset. Categories are not mutually exclusive and targets and ligands can fall into more than one, therefore totals are not the sum of all other rows.\nLigands\nCriteria for including a ligand remain focused on well-characterized, quantitative interactions with protein targets (Table 1B). Of the 816 ligands tagged as having relevance to immunopharmacology (see GtoImmuPdb Expansion-'Content and curation' section for details), ~30% have been added since the last update. As previously, ligands without an experimentally-verified molecular mechanism of action, but where potential efficacy is clearly described in papers, are also captured. There are new ligand groups, for example Immune checkpoint modulators (www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=969), which group disparate ligands with common functionality. We have extended the database schema to group some ligands into families using the information on Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) gene family pages (www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/genefamilies/); examples include cytokines and chemokines. A new family listing page exists under the 'Ligands' sub menu of the main navigation bar and also from the ligand list and individual ligand pages (www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandFamiliesForward).\nInteractions and database growth\nTable 1C and Figure 2 show the expansion of curated interaction data across targets and ligands. Most targets added over the past two years fall into the 'Enzyme' and 'Other protein' target categories.\nHuman interaction data growth since 2013. The first (left-most) chart shows the number of human targets with curated ligand interactions while the second chart includes only those targets that are supported by quantitative data. The third chart shows the number of target data-supported interactions to approved drugs and the fourth chart shows primary targets of those drugs.\nPubChem content\nOur PubChem integration strategy has been previously outlined. Since 2015 we have made nine PubChem submissions for new releases of our database. For 2017.5 (see release notes https://blog.guidetopharmacology.org/2017/08/22/database-release-2017-5/) we now have 8978 Substance Identifiers (SIDs) (PubChem query 'IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY'[SourceName]). We submit within days of our public release but it can take PubChem a few days to process a new submission and several weeks to complete the more computationally intensive relationship mappings (e.g. 3D neighbours).\nFigure 3 shows an analysis of our content in PubChem. For the SIDs (Figure 3A), we have extended our SID comments to be able to identify 'approved drug' and 'immunopharmacology' subsets. Submission to PubChem allows users the useful ability to compare different sources, using filters for 'slicing and dicing'. Doing so highlights our complementarity to other sources, such as GtoPdb having 1595 CID structures that ChEMBL does not (Figure 3B). The same figure shows that in the case of both DrugBank and DrugCentral there are ~5500 CIDs unique to just GtoPdb. A more detailed discussion of GtoPdb PubChem content and comparisons to other chemical sources can be found in our blog (https://blog.guidetopharmacology.org/2017/10/18/gtopdb-nar-database-issue-2018-pubchem-content/).\nCategory breakdown at the SID (A) and CID (B) level for GtoPdb PubChem entries. Note, in panel A, that the intersect between approved drug and immunopharmacology is derived from our curation of publications suggesting the association, but are not necessarily approved for immunological clinical indications.\nWebsite enhancements\nBLAST\nWe have extended the GtoPdb query tools with BLAST sequence-based searching of targets (www.guidetopharmacology.org/blast/), bypassing ambiguities of protein names. Users can BLAST a query sequence against GtoPdb targets either using a polypeptide or a nucleotide sequence, which will be automatically translated in all possible frames before querying. There is the option of supplying either FASTA sequences or plain-text sequences, pasted directly into the search box or uploaded. There are various controls to filter by species, number of hits and maximum Expect value (E).\nSAR data\nTo facilitate SAR studies with ligand sets for individual targets we have added the ability to download SAR data in comma-separated values (CSV) format. A link to an SAR file has been added to every target page above the tables of ligand binding data. To access SAR data for all targets, we point users to our download page (www.guidetopharmacology.org/download.jsp) where they can download a CSV file containing all interactions.\nVisualising ligand activity across species\nMany pharmacological parameters are reported in results sections of papers and cannot easily be found by searching of PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) abstracts. Curated databases such as GtoPdb and ChEMBL extract these parameters into a database format which facilitates findability and re-use. We have introduced interactive charts to summarize ligand activity at targets and compare pharmacological parameters across species. The bioactivity visualization tool uses data from GtoPdb and ChEMBL to present box plots summarising reported activities for a ligand at different targets. The charts show various pharmacological parameters expressed as -log10. For functional assays, potency values may include pIC50 or pEC50 values of agonists; pA2 or pKB values for antagonists. For ligand binding assays, values may be reported as pKd, pKi or pIC50. Pharmacological parameters are defined in NC-IUPHAR's terms and symbols publication. The plots for each species are given a unique colour, which allows species differences to be quickly visualized (Figure 4).\nLigand activity chart for palosuran (ACT-058362, GtoPdb ligand ID 3516), a small molecule urotensin II receptor antagonist. Hovering the mouse over the chart on a datapoint gives the median and range if more than one value is reported for the parameters shown on the horizontal axis. Zero indicates no data are available for that parameter. In the example, the results show the IC50 value for palosuran inhibition of binding was about ~5000-fold lower in rats compared with humans, showing a major difference between the two species.\nFurther information on assay details, references, PubMed links and source databases are in tables below the graphs. GtoPdb ligand binding data are supplemented with additional values from ChEMBL (currently version 23, updated when a new ChEMBL version is released) because, while GtoPdb primarily focuses on human targets with some supporting rodent data, ChEMBL covers a wider range of species reported in medicinal chemistry literature. Before including data from ChEMBL we applied filters, ensuring only single protein targets or protein complexes were included, normalising disparate pharmacological parameters to one of the five activity types above, converting raw data to -log10 values, and ignoring assays not marked as binding (B) or functional (F), as well as large scale screening data and anything with the 'outside typical range' warning flag.\nNC-IUPHAR and GtoPdb faculty pages\nNC-IUPHAR subcommittees reviewing GtoPdb data have, over 14 years, recorded contributions from over 800 scientists. To recognize their invaluable contributions, we have added contributor faculty pages, with individual profiles listing details of subcommittee membership and database contributions, institutional address, ORCIDs and external profile links such as departmental home pages, reference lists and social network profiles. The information is all entirely optional and provided by the individual, so some profiles are more complete than others. Contributor profiles may be accessed by clicking on a contributor's name in citations, on the contributor list (www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ContributorListForward) or via a database search. The new faculty pages also provide users with greater insight into the data review process and roles of subcommittees.\nGUIDE TO IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY\nThe Guide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY (GtoImmuPdb) expansion has extended the database to incorporate data types relevant to immunopharmacology, and associate these with existing target and ligand entities. This enrichment includes data on immunological processes or pathways, cell types of relevance to immunology, and diseases related to the immune/inflammatory system. We have already described the new targets and ligands included as part of GtoImmuPdb. Here we describe methodology of tagging new and existing targets and ligands along with the major data type expansions.\nContent and curation\nThe immunopharmacology extension necessitated adaptation of the selection criteria. We have been supported in identifying key papers by new NC-IUPHAR committees, and we expect to gather further feedback from users on the papers they would like to include and/or remove.\nTwitter is useful both for following a range of immunology journals and for broader alerting services such ImmuneRegulationNews (https://twitter.com/Immune_News), Human Immunology News (www.humanimmunologynews.com) and the British Society for Immunology (https://twitter.com/britsocimm). We have introduced an open pre-curation and contextual document triage using 'social tagging' via CiteUlike. The current list of over 700 immunopharmacology papers can be browsed via http://www.citeulike.org/tag/immpharm. These have an approximately equal split between context papers (target reviews and mechanistic immunology, e.g. (http://www.citeulike.org/user/efaccenda/article/14420478)) and those specifically designated for subsequent curatorial extraction. The former are collated under an immunopharmacology further reading page (http://www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org/GRAC/ImmunoFurtherReadingForward). For the latter, pre-curation notes are added in the comments section (e.g. http://www.citeulike.org/user/cdsouthan/article/14414220), with links to the database added post-curation. The 'curation queue' can be viewed at (http://www.citeulike.org/user/cdsouthan/tag/tobecurated).\nIn setting up GtoImmuPdb we had many detailed curatorial aspects to consider but four are especially important. The first is that there are no unique ligand or target entities since these are all subsumed into GtoPdb (and counted in our statistics sections). This is a pragmatic consequence of immunopharmacology being a subset of pharmacology. The second is that we have made greater use of both the Gene Ontology (GO) (www.geneontology.org) and the Cell Ontology (CO) (http://obofoundry/ontology/cl.html) for classifying targets. The third is we have introduced new levels of disease linking, including associating ligands directly to diseases for the first time. The fourth is that since some existing targets are multi-purpose, we needed to maintain a clear distinction between potential GtoImmuPdb targets (e.g. identified based on GO annotations and/or speculative comments in reviews) and those where the papers we curated have made an explicit experimental link in the form of ligands tested in systems relevant to the declared goal of advancing to a therapeutic application in immunology or inflammation. The necessity for this division is particularly important for kinases in immune system cells that can be targeted for cancer (e.g. antiproliferative) as well as immune system modulation.\nIdentifying targets and ligands of relevance to immunopharmacology in GtoPdb\nThe initial step was to identify within GtoPdb all targets and ligands relevant to immunopharmacology. We introduced a new GtoImmuPdb tag for targets and ligands, and added free-text comments describing reasons for inclusion and information about the role the target or ligand plays in immunopharmacology. Although the initial process used an automatic pipeline (see below) to identify relevant entities, all the data were reviewed by curators (supported by the appropriate committees or collaborators) before being included in GtoImmuPdb.\nKnown immune related targets and ligands (e.g. histamine receptors/antihistamine drugs, glucocorticoid receptor/corticosteroid drugs, protein kinases and their inhibitors used for immunology/inflammatory indications, targets of approved monoclonals and other biologics for immunology/inflammatory/immune-oncology indications).\nAdvice from our collaborators, who suggested several targets on which to focus as proof-of-concept (e.g. Bruton tyrosine kinase/Ibrutinib and other inhibitors, colony stimulating factor 1 receptor and associated pharmacological agents, Janus kinases and associated pharmacological agents).\nUsing GO annotations and literature reviews to prioritize immunological targets for curation (see below).\nThe review process focused on three main rationales: \nThe counts of GtoImmuPdb tagged targets and ligands are shown in Table 1, with the full list provided on the website (http://www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org/immuno/immunoHelpPage.jsp#downloads).\nCurators continually review literature covering immunology and inflammation using the triage methodology described above. New targets and ligands are added to the database as new evidence emerges. We also review clinical developments in immunity/inflammation/immuno-oncology fields. This includes evaluating clinical development pipelines, identifying lead compounds, their molecular targets and pharmacological data (which can involve interrogation of patent literature where peer reviewed disclosure is not yet available).\nIncorporating immunological process data\nThe first step was to determine, in consultation with immunologists, the major processes relevant to immunology. These top-level categories form the basis of organising, navigating and searching for immunological process data (Table 2). Existing targets in GtoPdb were then organized under the relevant process categories.\nGtoImmuPdb process category with count of human UniProtKB proteins assigned to them based on GO annotations\nProcess category	GtoPdb human UniProtKB	Target-GO annotations	 	Barrier integrity	40	52	 	Inflammation	576	1277	 	Antigen presentation	158	226	 	T cell (activation)	172	345	 	B cell (activation)	136	222	 	Immune regulation	435	1072	 	Tissue repair	18	18	 	Immune system development	199	350	 	Cytokine production and signalling	390	979	 	Chemotaxis and migration	229	382	 	Cellular signalling	448	1079	 	\nThe top-level process categories are underpinned by associating sets of GO immune and inflammatory biological process terms to each category. This serves two functions; it gives a controlled vocabulary and external identifiers which support data interoperability, and enabled an initial auto-curation of targets to the top-level process categories by using their GO annotations to classify them. Relevant parent GO terms, and all their child terms, were mapped to each category. This is illustrated in Figure 5 which shows the parent GO terms (and counts of child terms) mapped to the T cell activation process category.\nIllustrating the mapping of GO parent terms to the GtoImmuPdb top-level process category, T-cell activation. Six parent terms are mapped, which encompasses 471 distinct child terms. Using GO annotations to UniProt we find that there are 172 human targets in GtoPdb with annotations to one or more of those 471 GO terms (see Table 2).\nGO terms and IDs related to immune and inflammatory processes were obtained from the GO Consortium (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go.obo) and used to populate database tables. We captured all is_a relationships between the terms to support inferred searching by GO terms. This means a search on a parent term will also include any of its children.\nTarget-GO annotations were downloaded from UniProtKB (2017_08 release) and parsed into the database, along with GO evidence codes (www.geneontology.org/page/guide-go-evidence-codes). GO evidence code indicate the level of support for annotations to terms, which allows users and curators to judge the strength of the evidence for the association. Associations where the evidence is tenuous, such as for the IEA (Inferred by Electronic Analysis) code, can be split (this is the only evidence code that is assigned automatically by GO, without curatorial judgement).\nThe set of target-GO annotations was used to automatically assign targets to the top-level categories. Our curators then reviewed the annotations. Table 2 summarizes the total number of GO annotations to targets, and the number of UniProtKB proteins, under each category. These mappings can be downloaded from the website (http://www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org/immuno/immunoHelpPage.jsp#downloads). All process associations can be browsed from the Immuno Process association pages (www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org/GRAC/ProcessesForward). In order to keep GO annotations up-to-date with the latest UniProtKB release, we have semi-automated scripts that are run upon each database release.\nIncorporating immune system cell type data\nWe used a similar approach to incorporate cell type data. We sought input from immunologists to establish a set of top-level cell type categories, against which targets in GtoImmuPdb can be annotated. For example mast cells are included due to their relevance in anti-allergic therapies, and there is a category for innate lymphoid cells, reflecting the growing understanding of their role within the innate immune system in the control of tissue homeostasis, infection, inflammation, metabolic disease and cancer. We have under-pinned these categories with terms from the CO. The full list of cell type categories, their CO term assignments, and a breakdown of targets in each category are given in Table 3.\nGtoImmuPdb cell type top-level categories, with associated Cell Ontology terms and count of distinct targets annotated to each category\nCell type category	Cell Ontology terms	Targets annotated	 	B cells	CL:0000945 lymphocyte of B lineage	32	 	T cells	CL:0000789 alpha-beta T cell	39	 		CL:0000815 regulatory T cell		 		CL:0000911 effector T cell		 	Dendritic cells	CL:0000451 dendritic cell	29	 	Other T cells	CL:0000798 gamma-delta T cell	1	 		CL:0000814 mature NK T cell		 		CL:0000898 naive T cell		 		CL:0000940 mucosal invariant T cell		 	Macrophages and monocytes	CL:0000235 macrophage	37	 		CL:0000576 monocyte	37	 	Granulocytes	CL:0000094 granulocyte	34	 	Natural killer cells	CL:0000623 natural killer cell	21	 	Mast cells	CL:0000097 mast cell	26	 	Innate lymphoid cells	CL:0001065 innate lymphoid cell	0	 	Stromal cells	CL:0000499 stromal cell	0	 	\nT cells are split into two categories, 'T cells' and 'other T cells', which was to keep the regulatory T cells together and distinct from other T cell types.\nThe top-level categories broadly correlate with the CO terminology. We then selected relevant parent terms and mapped these to our top-level categories. This enables inferred searches to be run via any CO term, finding targets associated to that term or its children. It also supports higher resolution annotation and gives a controlled vocabulary and external identifiers. Cell type associations can be browsed from the Immuno Cell Type association pages (www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org/GRAC/CelltypesForward).\nAssociating diseases on immunological relevance\nGtoPdb already contained data on diseases, including clinically-relevant mutations and pathophysiological roles of targets. We have extended the schema to include specific associations of targets and ligands with diseases of immunological relevance. Curatorial comments describe the link between the target or ligand and the disease, along with supporting literature references. New disease summary pages link information on approved drugs, clinical use and primary targets to disease associations, bringing new perspectives to immunopharmacology data.\nWe consulted several resources:OMIM (www.omim.org/), Orphanet (www.orpha.net) and the Disease Ontology (http://disease-ontology.org/). Incorporating their disease terminology provides a controlled vocabulary, and cross-references our disease associations to other resources.\nThe GtoPdb database contains over 2000 disease terms (including synonyms). We have so far matched over 300 to ligands of immunological relevance. Curation of targets against immunological disease is in its infancy, but already contains associations to 17 immunological diseases. As expected, these include those under particularly active investigation (as judged by the current literature output), such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sepsis and fibrosis. A full breakdown of the disease associations can be viewed at www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org/GRAC/ImmunoDiseaseListForward?type=target.\nWEBSITE\nThe GtoPdb website has been extended to surface new data types and incorporate them into existing search and browse mechanisms. We have not developed a new resource, but have extended the existing database and website with a new 'layer' of immunological data and an interface for immunologist users, the 'GtoImmuPdb view' of the data. This view highlights content of immunological relevance and prioritizes immunological data in search results and displays. In addition, we created a new entry portal (at www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org) which provides access points to immunological data.\nAt this stage, the Guide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY is in beta-release (v2.0): although it contains most features and functionality expected in the full public release (due in 2018), it remains under development and may contain minor bugs and/or portions not yet optimized. Full details on navigating the new features of GtoImmuPdb are in our website tutorial (www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org/immuno/docs/GtoImmuPdb_Tutorial.pdf).\nPortal\nThe GtoImmuPdb portal is intended to provide a new access point to the database, with quick access to the data types of most relevance to immunopharmacology. The portal is styled after its parent GtoPdb, but with its own distinctive logo, header and colour scheme. This ensures that it is intuitively familiar to GtoPdb users while at the same time maintaining its own identity. We have also used the new colour scheme to highlight content of relevance to immunopharmacology within the existing GtoPdb interface. In several places toggle buttons allow users to switch between the new GtoImmuPdb view and the existing GtoPdb view (see Figure 1). The portal provides easy access to the new data types via panels on the portal home page. Detailed descriptions of navigating and viewing data in GtoImmuPdb are given in the next few sections. A revised menu bar has been developed for GtoImmuPdb that includes links and resources specific for GtoImmuPdb, including links to the new Process, Cell Type and Disease data. The site-wide search box in the top-right has also been modified to search across the new data types (see the 'Searching GtoImmuPdb' section for details).\nProcess associations to targets\nClicking one of the top-level categories on the Processes panel displays a new page listing all targets associated with that process (www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectImmProcessListForward?immprocess=2). For each target, curators' comments give detailed information about the target's relevance to the immunological process and immunopharmacology in general. Immune-relevant GO annotations to the targets, including the GO ID and evidence code, are displayed, enabling users to assess the strength of the association. Targets are organized into sections, one for each main target class; quick links at the top of the page allow users to jump to each of these sections. The page also has a pull-down menu containing all the top-level process categories, enabling the user to easily switch between different categories. The process associations to target pages can also be accessed via the main menu bar and there is a processes home page (www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org/GRAC/ProcessesForward) that summarizes each of the categories, including lists of the GO parent terms that are used to define them.\nCell type associations to targets\nUsers can click on the portal's cell types panel to access a list of targets associated to each cell type (www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectCelltypeAssocListForward?immcelltype=2) (Figure 6A). This is very similar to the process list described above. Curators' comments are displayed next to CO terms and IDs for each target. It includes links to each target class, and a pull-down menu to switch between cell type categories.\nDisplaying GtoImmuPdb data. (A) Shows the display of GtoImmuPdb cell type to target associations, here showing T cells. This layout is also used for the display of process association data. (B) Shows the display of ligand disease associations, showing the first three ligands for rheumatoid arthritis.\nDisease associations\nThe portal also links to lists of curated immunological disease associations to either targets or ligands. Figure 6B shows the display for ligands associated to immunological diseases. Users can switch between viewing targets or ligands via a tab at the top of the page. Diseases are listed in alphabetical order, with external references to OMIM, Orphanet and the Disease Ontology.\nA single disease may be associated with many different ligands, although usually not as many targets. Therefore, the page keeps the full list of targets and ligands associated with each disease hidden on initial view. The total number of targets or ligands associated with the disease is shown, along with a preview of the names of the first few targets or ligands. A toggle link can be clicked to expand the section to list all associations. There are controls on the page to hide or show all the disease associations if required. In the expanded view, target associations show the name of the target, curator comments and lists of approved drugs (ligands which are currently, or have been in the past, approved for human clinical use by a regulatory agency) that interact with the target. This list is restricted to only those drugs for which the target is classed as a primary target of the compound. When viewing disease associations to ligands in the expanded view, it lists the ligand name (linked to the ligand summary page) and curator comments.\nTargets\nTargets are browsed in GtoPdb via hierarchical trees of protein families. This display has been enhanced for GtoImmuPdb by highlighting families of immunological relevance in blue (Figure 1B). Likewise, when viewing a family page, any individual targets of immunological relevance are also highlighted. New toggle buttons allow users to switch between GtoPdb and GtoImmuPdb views. The detailed view page for a target has been extended to include the new immunological data types incorporated for GtoImmuPdb. The same data are displayed in both views, but in the GtoImmuPdb view the new sections are highlighted, helping to alert users to the content. These include general comments on immunopharmacology as well as any process, cell type or disease associations (Figure 7 A and B). Additionally, within the existing sections of the detailed view page that list ligand interactions, a new GtoImmuPdb logo is displayed where the ligand has been tagged of relevance to immunopharmacology (Figure 7C).\nShowing the target detailed view page with immunological data highlighted. (A) Top section of the detailed view page for RIG-1 (DExD/H-Box helicase 58) with immunopharmacology content links highlighted. (B) Immunopharmacology data sections on the detailed view page. (C) Ligand binding data (from Bruton tyrosine kinase) showing the new immunological icon in blue to highlight ligands also tagged in GtoImmuPdb.\nLigands\nModifications have been made to the way ligand categories are displayed under GtoImmuPdb. The ligands panel on the portal prioritizes the immuno ligand and antibody categories (likely to be of greater interest to immunologists). When viewing the ligand list page, a new 'immuno' ligands category has been added as a tab and when viewing any category under the GtoImmuPdb view, only ligands tagged (see 'Content and curation' section) in GtoImmuPdb are displayed. Again, a toggle allows the user to switch between GtoPdb and GtoImmuPdb views. As on target pages, relevant ligands are highlighted using the new immunopharmacology icon. Individual ligand summary pages also now have a tab that includes immunopharmacology-related data specific to the ligand. At present, this includes curator comments, disease associations and references.\nSearching GtoImmuPdb\nSearch mechanisms have been extended to incorporate all additional immunological data, including process, cell type and disease terms, ontological definitions and ontology IDs. We have also modified the search algorithm when searching via the GtoImmuPdb portal to increase the ranking of results likely to be of greater immunological relevance. We applied a weighting to certain database fields so that entities matching on those fields will appear higher up the list of results. The weighting is only applied when searching from a GtoImmuPdb page, not from the standard GtoPdb pages and is based on the amount of immunological data curated against an entity. For example, targets that have process, cell type and disease data annotated against them will rank higher than targets with only process data. This is in addition to existing search weightings:so exact matches (to target or ligand name for example) will still get a higher score.\nHelp and tutorials\nWe encourage users to familiarize themselves with the new data and navigation of the GtoImmuPdb portal by browsing the help pages (www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org/immuno/immunoHelpPage.jsp) and the specific tutorial (www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org/immuno/docs/GtoImmuPdb_Tutorial.pdf). The help pages also contain links to download sets of GtoImmuPdb data. We have also added popup help guides on the main portal for each major data type.\nCOLLABORATIONS, CONNECTIVITY AND INTEROPERABILITY\nELIXIR\nELIXIR is the European infrastructure established specifically for the sharing and sustainability of life science data (www.elixir-europe.org/). The UK node, ELIXIR-UK (www.elixir-uk.org/), expanded in 2015/16, sought to identify resources that were representative of the UK bioinformatics community and bring the benefit of participation to a wider range of UK institutions. Falling within ELIXR's strategic theme of human health and disease, GtoPdb already has links with other ELIXIR resources, including UniProtKB (where we regularly update cross-references), and is in a good position to interoperate with other resources through our use of standard ontologies and identifiers (UniProtKB Accessions, nomenclature (as assigned by NC-IUPHAR committees in collaboration with HGNC), Ensembl IDs, PubMed IDs and PDB IDs). We see to improve our interoperability and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) compliance by producing GtoPdb in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, thereby making the data and the ontologies used machine readable.\nRDF\nOver the last year, work has been carried out to design and implement an RDF version of a subset of the GtoPdb dataset, now available from (www.guidetopharmacology.org/downloads.jsp). The RDF data generation has been focussed on the main target-ligand interaction data. To ensure FAIR compliance machine-readable metadata have been generated in accordance with the W3C Health Care and Life Sciences Community (HCLS) Profile. As an example of RDF modelling, the interaction between the target 5-HT1A receptor and the ligand Ipsapirone is shown in Figure 8. In addition to the already stated aim of making GtoPdb FAIR compliant, it was also planned as a way to include the GtoPdb data into the Open PHACTS Drug Discovery Platform.\nSchematic diagram illustrating the RDF relationship between the target 5-HT1A receptor and the ligand Ipsapirone.\nWe have developed an ontology (http://rdf.guidetopharmacology.org/ns/gtpo), that represents the schema of the RDF data, in accordance with current best practice using the 'Indirect reuse of ontology design patterns and alignments' ontology design pattern. The units used for the affinity values in the interactions are reused from the BioAssay Ontology (BAO). Working with the maintainers of BAO new entries have been added for pKB, pKi and pKd. Defining our own core ontology allowed us to: (i) ensure that the terms capture the actual interpretation in GtoPdb - the terms were modelled around the existing GtoPdb glossary (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/helpPage.jsp#glossary); (ii) eliminate potentially unstable external dependencies. The downside of the approach is that the terms are not immediately interoperable, for example with the ChEMBL terms, except via the use of the equivalence mappings that are published alongside the ontology. The RDF data are generated from the corresponding released version of the GtoPdb database. This ensures that the RDF data are consistent with the database content and do not require the maintenance of a second database. Three relational-to-RDF (R2RM,) mapping files have been created that control the generation of the RDF data:one each for targets, ligands and interactions respectively. These are available from https://github.com/HW-SWeL/GTP-RDF/tree/master/Morph/Guide2Pharma/R2RML. We execute the mappings using the Morph RDB framework. Again, following best practice, a table identifier scheme has been established for the RDF data. Another key aspect of the generation process is the creation of machine-readable metadata. The metadata capture the provenance information between the RDF version of the data and the relational database version that was used to create it. The metadata comply with the W3C HCLS Community Profile to the SHOULD level and this has been verified with the Validata tool (http://hw-swel.github.io/Validata).\nWe are in the process of providing linked data pages for each resource in the RDF data, i.e. the URL used to identify each target, ligand and interaction in the RDF will become dereferenceable. Additionally, we will be providing a SPARQL endpoint with a set of example queries to help exploit the RDF data and enable deeper analysis of the GtoPdb data in conjunction with other linked data datasets. In the future, we will provide link-sets that capture the database cross-references contained in the GtoPdb as well as extend coverage of the data.\nDatabase links\nThe current set of database link-outs from GtoPdb target and ligand pages can be viewed at www.guidetopharmacology.org/helpPage.jsp#databaseLinks. New links since 2016 on the ligand side include UniChem, which cross-references between chemical structure identifiers from different databases. On the target side, there are links to the SLC Transporter Database (http://slc.bioparadigms.org/) with information on transporter functional genomics, CATH structural domains and superfamilies and the Human Protein Atlas tissue expression database, these latter two being ELIXIR core resources. We have also ensured cross-links exist between GtoPdb and the Pharmacology Education Website (PEP, www.pharmacologyeducation.org/) and SynPharm (http://synpharm.guidetopharmacology.org/), the database of ligand-binding sequences.\nWe ensure that the cross-links are regularly refreshed through formal and informal contacts with database providers. Of note are the links to RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) (www.rcsb.org) ligands. The acceleration at which pharmacological targets are being co-crystallized with ligands caused us to introduce PDB InChIKey look-ups as part of our database update procedure, to ensure that links are up-to-date in each release. Consequent to the creation of peptide ligand family pages, we also updated our reciprocal HGNC links to include human genes encoding peptide ligands. We encourage in-links from other resources, although it is difficult to discern the extent of these unless we are directly informed or cited. A recent survey (https://blog.guidetopharmacology.org/2016/03/30/collation-and-assessment-of-gtopdb-in-links) found these were over 20 in number and we also not that we have recently been incorporated into an internal-only resource, the CHEMGENIE database from Merck &amp; Co.\nJournal to database connectivity\nGtoPdb has continued to enhance its connectivity to journals. Much of our endeavours since our last update have been described in our blog (https://blog.guidetopharmacology.org/2017/10/18/gtopdb-nar-database-issue-2018-journal-to-database-connectivity-and-journal-to-gtopdb-links/). This includes details on PubMed ID statistics in curated GtoPdb content. The same post also shows how engagement with British Journal of Pharmacology (BJP) has extended the previous provision of live out-links, to now include in line links, rather than the previous method of adding separate tables to manuscripts.\nExternal profile\nWe use a number of strategies to disseminate information about GtoPdb. Our NC-IUPHAR newsletter is prepared in sync with database releases and sent to subscribers and committee members with articles about the database and hot topics in pharmacology. Social media (Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn) is one of our primary methods of outreach to announce database updates, publications of interest, upcoming events and IUPHAR reviews. Our blog (https://blog.guidetopharmacology.org/) is used to provide detailed descriptions of database releases, technical updates and commentary on hot topics in pharmacology. For example, the development of the Guide to IMUNOPHARMACOLOGY is described in a series of technical blog posts (https://blog.guidetopharmacology.org/category/guide-to-immunopharmacology/). We also share posters and presentations made by the team on our SlideShare account (www.slideshare.net/GuidetoPHARM). We track user interactions via Google analytics which shows a monthly average of ~29 500 sessions from 19 500 users, over the 6 months from April 2017 to September 2017. We have also produced our third edition of The Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2017/18 that includes links to 1679 targets and 3524 ligands (www.guidetopharmacology/concise).\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\nGuide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY is in its beta phase: we expect the portal and website to be completed by Spring 2018 when the first full public release will be available. At present, most features of the interface are in place. We have undertaken a short phase of user-testing; an exercise we plan to repeat before the full public release. This will identify any aspects of the design and navigation that need improvement, and features that users would like to see implemented. In response to previous user feedback we will also consider a graphical-based navigation system to improve user-friendliness and enhance the look of the website.\nNew data curation will continue until Autumn 2018, with a focus on target associations to disease and cell types that are currently under-represented in the database. We will also continue to assign further targets to top-level immunological process categories by looking at their GO annotations and supporting evidence.\nWe will continue the development of our RDF platform with short-term priorities of establishing a linked data explorer and a SPARQL end-point to enable queries across the data. Making the RDF publicly available allows integration into other semantic databases (both proprietary and non-proprietary).\nWe are also working with Bioschemas (http://bioschemas.org/) to add schema.org semantic mark-up to GtoPdb, which would make it easier for search engines to find, collate and analyse the data.\nMany of the main use-cases and features in GtoPdb will be elaborated on in a forthcoming paper in Current Protocols in Bioinformatics (manuscript in preparation).\nA new, sister resource to the main GtoPdb called SynPharm (http://synpharm.guidetopharmacology.org/) has been developed as a database of drug-responsive protein sequences, derived from the interactions in GtoPdb and using data from the RCSB PDB. SynPharm is an open-access, web-based tool that integrates pharmacological and ligand-protein binding information to present data on the drug-binding domains of proteins in a manner useful to synthetic biologists. It will be kept up-to-date in line with GtoPdb and we are preparing a paper detailing the resource.\nDATA ACCESS\nGtoPdb and GtoImmuPdb are available online at http://www.guidetopharmacology.org and http://www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org, respectively. Both are licensed under the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) (http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/), and the contents are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). Recommendations for accessing and downloading data, and linking to us remain as reported in 2016. We provide various options for download, and users are welcome to contact us (enquiries@guidetopharmacology.org) for additional datasets and file formats. We provide a dump file of the full PostgreSQL database (http://www.postgresql.org/) but we no longer provide a MySQL version as standard (although we would be glad to provide this on request). We also provide RDF flat files as described above (available from www.guidetopharmacology.org/downloads.jsp), which users can load into a local triple store and perform SPARQL queries across the data. Our REST web services are available at http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/webServices.jsp and provide computational access to data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. In response to user feedback we recently expanded and revised our web services and made speed improvements. We added services to allow direct querying of interaction data and references. For example, users can now obtain a complete set of target-ligand interactions with many options to filter this list, including by target or ligand type, binding affinity, drug approval status or chemical structure. We encourage users to get in touch if they download data in any format, both for further advice and so we are aware of applications using GtoPdb data.\nCITING THE RESOURCE\nPlease cite this article rather than the previous ones; citation advice for specific target pages appears on the website.

1 receptor (IL-1R) superfamily, and has been implicated in the activation of adaptive immunity.\n Signaling by hToll is shown to occur through sequential recruitment of the adapter molecule MyD88 and the IL-1R–associated kinase.\n Tumor necrosis factor receptor–activated factor 6 (TRAF6) and the nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B)–inducing kinase (NIK) are both involved in subsequent steps of NF-?B activation.\n Conversely, a dominant negative version of TRAF6 failed to block hToll-induced activation of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, thus suggesting an early

domain.\n The UMLS coverage is quite extensive, including not only\nmany concepts in clinical medicine, but also a large number of concepts applicable to\nthe broad domain of the life sciences.\n In order to provide an overarching conceptual\nframework for all UMLS concepts, we developed an upper-level ontology, called the\nUMLS semantic network.\n The semantic network, through its 134 semantic types,\nprovides a consistent categorization of all concepts represented in the UMLS.\n The 54\nlinks between the semantic types provide the structure for the network and represent\nimportant relationships in the biomedical domain.\n Because of the growing number of\ninformation resources that contain genetic information, the UMLS coverage in this\narea is being expanded.\n We recently integrated the taxonomy of organisms developed\nby the NLM's National Center for Biotechnology Information, and we are currently\nworking together with the developers of the Gene Ontology to integrate this resource,\nas well.\n As additional, standard, ontologies become publicly available, we expect to\nintegrate these into the UMLS

obscuring contributions from rare cell types and of potential subpopulations.\n To overcome this challenge, we developed an automated platform that uses FACS, robotics, and the CEL-Seq2 protocol to obtain the transcriptomes of thousands of single pancreatic cells from deceased organ donors, allowing in silico purification of all main pancreatic cell types.\n We identify cell type-specific transcription factors and a subpopulation of REG3A-positive acinar cells.\n We also show that CD24 and TM4SF4 expression can be used to sort live alpha and beta cells with high purity.\n This resource

ontology interoperability","abstract":"Background\nThe Cell Ontology (CL) is an OBO Foundry candidate ontology covering the domain of canonical, natural biological cell types.\n\n Since its inception in 2005, the CL has undergone multiple rounds of revision and expansion, most notably in its representation of hematopoietic cells.\n\n For in vivo cells, the CL focuses on vertebrates but provides general classes that can be used for other metazoans, which can be subtyped in species-specific ontologies.\n\n\nConstruction and content\nRecent work on the CL has focused on extending the representation of various cell types, and developing new modules in the CL itself, and in related ontologies in coordination with the CL.\n\n For example, the Kidney and Urinary Pathway Ontology was used as a template to populate the CL with additional cell types.\n\n In addition, subtypes of the class ‘cell in vitro’ have received improved definitions and labels to provide for modularity with the representation of cells in the Cell Line Ontology and Reagent Ontology.\n\n Recent changes in the ontology development methodology for CL include a switch from OBO to OWL for the primary encoding of the ontology, and an increasing reliance on logical definitions for improved reasoning.\n\n\nUtility and discussion\nThe CL is now mandated as a metadata standard for large functional genomics and transcriptomics projects, and is used extensively for annotation, querying, and analyses of cell type specific data in sequencing consortia such as FANTOM5 and ENCODE, as well as for the NIAID ImmPort database and the Cell Image Library.\n\n The CL is also a vital component used in the modular construction of other biomedical ontologies—for example, the Gene Ontology and the cross-species anatomy ontology, Uberon, use CL to support the consistent representation of cell types across different levels of anatomical granularity, such as tissues and organs.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe ongoing improvements to the CL make it a valuable resource to both the OBO Foundry community and the wider scientific community, and we continue to experience increased interest in the CL both among developers and within the user community.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4932724","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander

methods outperform unsupervised methods for cell type identification.\n A case study highlights the usefulness of these methods for comparing cell type distributions in healthy and diseased mice.\n Finally, we present scQuery, a web server which uses our neural networks and fast matching methods to determine cell types, key genes, and more.\n","id":"PMC6233170","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

important tool in refining and enhancing the existing annotation catalogs, such as the Gene Ontology (GO) database.\n However, functional labels with only a few (&lt;10) annotated genes, which constitute about half of the GO terms in yeast, mouse and human, pose a unique challenge in that any prediction algorithm that independently considers each label faces a paucity of information and thus is prone to capture non-generalizable patterns in the data, resulting in poor predictive performance.\n There exist a variety of algorithms for function prediction, but none properly address this ‘overfitting’ issue of sparsely annotated functions, or do so in a manner scalable to tens of thousands of functions in the human

of science: unique identification of research resources in the biomedical literature","abstract":"Scientific reproducibility has been at the forefront of many news stories and there exist numerous initiatives to help address this problem.\n We posit that a contributor is simply a lack of specificity that is required to enable adequate research reproducibility.\n In particular, the inability to uniquely identify research resources, such as antibodies and model organisms, makes it difficult or impossible to reproduce experiments even where the science is otherwise sound.\n In order to better understand the magnitude of this problem, we designed an experiment to ascertain the “identifiability” of research resources in the biomedical literature.\n We evaluated recent journal articles in the fields of Neuroscience, Developmental Biology, Immunology, Cell and Molecular Biology and General Biology, selected randomly based on a diversity of impact factors for the journals, publishers, and experimental method reporting guidelines.\n We attempted to uniquely identify model organisms (mouse, rat, zebrafish, worm, fly and yeast), antibodies, knockdown reagents (morpholinos or RNAi), constructs, and cell lines.\n Specific criteria were developed to determine if a resource was uniquely identifiable, and included examining relevant repositories (such as model organism databases, and the Antibody Registry), as well as vendor sites.\n The results of this experiment show that 54% of resources are not uniquely identifiable in publications, regardless of domain, journal impact factor, or reporting requirements.\n For example, in many cases the organism strain in which the experiment was performed or antibody that was used could not be identified.\n Our results show that identifiability is a serious problem for reproducibility.\n Based on these results, we provide recommendations to authors, reviewers, journal editors, vendors, and publishers.\n Scientific efficiency and reproducibility depend upon a research-wide improvement of this substantial problem in science today.\n","id":"PMC3771067","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"PeerJ

compound identifier mapping service on the internet, designed to optimize the efficiency with which structure-based hyperlinks may be built and maintained between chemistry-based resources.\n In the past, the creation and maintenance of such links at EMBL-EBI, where several chemistry-based resources exist, has required independent efforts by each of the separate teams.\n These efforts were complicated by the different data models, release schedules, and differing business rules for compound normalization and identifier nomenclature that exist across the organization.\n UniChem, a large-scale, non-redundant database of Standard InChIs with pointers between these structures and chemical identifiers from all the separate chemistry resources, was developed as a means of efficiently sharing the maintenance overhead of creating these links.\n Thus, for each source represented in UniChem, all links to and from all other sources are automatically calculated and immediately available for all to use.\n Updated mappings are immediately available upon loading of new data releases from the sources.\n Web services in UniChem provide users with a single simple automatable mechanism for maintaining all links from their resource to all other sources represented in UniChem.\n In addition, functionality to track changes in identifier usage allows users to monitor which identifiers are current, and which are obsolete.\n Lastly, UniChem has been deliberately designed to allow additional resources to be included with minimal effort.\n Indeed, the recent inclusion of data sources external to EMBL-EBI has provided a simple means of providing users with an even wider selection of resources with which to link to, all at no extra cost, while at the same time providing a simple mechanism for external resources to link to all EMBL-EBI chemistry resources.\n","id":"PMC3616875","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Structure DataBase (CSDB) of the NCI CADD Group, an aggregated collection of over 150 small-molecule databases totaling 103.5 million structure records, to conduct tautomerism analyses on one of the largest currently existing sets of real (i.\ne.\n not computer-generated) compounds.\n This analysis was carried out using calculable chemical structure identifiers developed by the NCI CADD Group, based on hash codes available in the chemoinformatics toolkit CACTVS and a newly developed scoring scheme to define a canonical tautomer for any encountered structure.\n CACTVS’s tautomerism definition, a set of 21 transform rules expressed in SMIRKS line notation, was used, which takes a comprehensive stance as to the possible types of tautomeric interconversion included.\n Tautomerism was found to be possible for more than 2/3 of the unique structures in the CSDB.\n A total of 680 million tautomers were calculated from, and including, the original structure records.\n Tautomerism overlap within the same individual database (i.\ne.\n at least one other entry was present that was really only a different tautomeric representation of the same compound) was found at an average rate of 0.3% of the original structure records, with values as high as nearly 2% for some of the databases in CSDB.\n Projected onto the set of unique structures (by FICuS identifier), this still occurred in about 1.5% of the cases.\n Tautomeric overlap across all constituent databases in CSDB was found for nearly 10% of the records in the collection.\n","id":"PMC2886898","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer

that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings.\n Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.\n This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.\n","id":"PMC4792175","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing

The BAAP Study protocol\nBackground\nAcute bronchitis is one of the most prevalent respiratory infections in primary care, and in more than 90% of the cases antibiotics are prescribed, mainly when purulent expectoration is present. However, this process is usually viral in origin and the benefits of antibiotic treatment are marginal. On the other hand, in recent years bronchitis has been considered more as an inflammatory than an infectious process. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a schedule of an oral anti-inflammatory compared with an antibiotic regimen and another group assigned to receive a placebo.\nMethods and design\nA total of 420 patients from 15 to 70 years of age with no associated comorbidity, presenting respiratory tract infection of at least one week of evolution, with cough as the predominant symptom, the presence of purulent expectoration and at least one other symptom of the respiratory tract (dyspnoea, wheezing, chest discomfort or pain), with no alternative explanation such as pneumonia, will be included in a prospective, randomised and controlled, clinical trial with placebo. The patients will be randomised to receive one of three treatments: ibuprofen, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid or placebo for 10 days. The main outcome measure is the number of days with frequent cough defined by the symptom diary with a score of 1 or more.\nDiscussion\nThis trial is designed to evaluate the number of days with frequent cough with anti-inflammatory treatment compared with antimicrobial treatment and placebo in previously healthy patients with a clinical picture of acute bronchitis and purulent expectoration. It is hypothesized that anti-inflammatory treatment is more effective than antibiotic treatment to reduce cough, which is the most disturbing symptom for patients with this infection.\nTrial registration\nISRCTN07852892\nBackground\nAcute bronchitis is a clinical term which implies a self-limiting infection of the large airways and is characterized by clinical manifestations of cough without pneumonia. This process affects approximately 5% of adults annually with a greater incidence in the winter. It accounts for 9.4% of the infections attended by family physicians. Acute bronchitis is mainly a viral infection. The role of bacteria in this infection continues to be controversial since bronchial biopsies have never demonstrated bacterial invasion. In some cases atypical germs may be involved including Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumonia .\nIt is thought that acute bronchitis reflects an inflammatory response to infections of the epithelium of the bronchi. Microscopic examination demonstrates a thickening of the bronchial and tracheal mucosa corresponding to the inflamed areas. These pathological findings are consistent with publications of proximal lower airway inflammation observed with positron emission tomography. During the first days of infection, the symptoms of upper respiratory infections cannot be clinically distinguished from the symptoms of acute bronchitis. However, in acute bronchitis cough lasts more than five days and during this prolonged period of symptoms, the results of functional respiratory tests are usually abnormal. Forty per cent of the patients present significant reductions in forced espiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) with values of less than 80% over the theoretical value, or bronchial hyper-reactivity with improvement during the following 5-6 weeks. Cough may persist from 10 to 20 days in acute bronchitis, but it may sometimes last up to 4 weeks or more. In a recent study on the efficacy of the acellular pertussis vaccine including 2,781 healthy adults, the mean duration of cough in acute bronchitis by all causes was 18 days, with a median of 24 days. Moreover, almost half of the patients with acute bronchitis report the production of purulent expectoration. Peroxidase released by the leukocytes in sputum causes the colour changes; hence, colour alone should not be considered indicative of bacterial infection. Indeed, in healthy adults, the positive predictive value of purulent sputum for the presence of alveolar disease is low, being of approximately 10%.\nBronchitis has shown to reduce the quality of life of patients. One study on the quality of life of patients with infections of the upper respiratory tract, some of which were labelled acute bronchitis, showed a reduction in seven subscales of the 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey, including vital and social function, although this decrease was transitory. Furthermore, up to twenty per cent of the patients return to their physician within the first month for the persistence of symptoms.\nPrevious research\nThere is clear evidence that antibiotics should not be recommended in non-complicated acute bronchitis. However, their use on behalf of primary care physicians in Spain is greater than 80%. Similar percentages have been reported by primary care practitioners in United States and other countries. Systematic analyses of clinical trials suggest that antibiotics may achieve a reduction, albeit only marginal, in the duration of the symptoms. Specifically, a meta-analysis of 8 clinical trials showed that the symptoms reduced a few hours with the use of doxycycline, erythromycin or trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. The results were statistically significant but clinically trivial. The results of a randomized, double-blind study in which a course of azithromycin during 5 days in 112 patients was compared with vitamin C in 108 patients published after this meta-analysis did not show any difference between groups in the quality of life at 7 days (main outcome variable) or in the proportion of patients who had to return to work, school or normal activities at home at days 3 or 7. A review of the Cochrane Library including 9 randomized, controlled, clinical trials of antibiotic agents (including three clinical trials not included in the previous review) also showed a significant, albeit lower, reduction in the duration of cough, of only 0.6 hours. A non-significant reduction in the number of days of feeling badly and a non-significant increase in the number of adverse effects attributed to the antibiotic therapy (relative risk of adverse effects: 1.22; CI95%: 0.94 to 1.58) were also found. At this point, the study by Stott et al. is of note in which only patients with acute bronchitis with purulent expectoration were included and in which no statistically significant differences were observed in the resolution of cough between the group treated with antibiotics and those assigned to the control group. Thus, Spanish primary care physicians have the perception that the presence of purulent expectoration in the course of acute bronchitis is suggestive of bacterial superinfection, very probably due to the fact that purulent expectoration is a criterion of antibiotic therapy in patients with other lower respiratory tract infections such as acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Indeed, in a questionnaire given to more than 1,000 primary care physicians, more than 90% responded that they would treat a 30-year-old patient with associated comorbidity presenting a non-pneumonic respiratory infection with sputum purulence with antibiotics.\nIn recent years the idea that acute bronchitis is more an inflammatory than infectious process has begun to take shape. Thus, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have shown to be effective in reducing the duration and the intensity of cough in patients with bronchitis in observational studies and they are therefore recommended in the guidelines of clinical practice. However, their effectiveness has not been observed in clinical trials. To date, no study has been published comparing the role of anti-inflammatory drugs with antibiotics. We therefore designed this clinical trial with the aim of determining the effectiveness of ibuprofen (most frequently prescribed anti-inflammatory drug in Spain) compared with the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (antibiotic most often prescribed by Spanish primary care physicians) and also compared with a placebo groups of healthy adult patients with acute bronchitis and purulent expectoration.\nObjectives\nThe aim of the study is to evaluate the number of days of frequent cough (defined by the symptom diary with a score of 1 or more) in the three treatment arms (oral anti-inflammatory, antibiotic or placebo) taken during 10 days. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy on the second visit, evaluate the speed of action in the resolution of the symptoms of acute bronchitis in the three treatment arms, assess the relationship between C-reactive protein concentrations and the resolution of the symptoms in each treatment arm and evaluate the secondary effects and adverse reactions in the three treatment arms of the study.\nMethods\nDesign of the study\nThe study entails a 3-armed randomized clinical trial performed in Catalonia, Spain. The medical Ethics Committee Fundacio d'Investigacio en Atencio Primaria has approved the study design, the protocols, information letters to the patients and the informed consent form. The study has obtained a grant from the Fondo de Investigacion Sanitaria of the Ministry of Health and Consumption in the announcement of independent investigation and has been approved by the Spanish Agency of Medication and Healthcare Products.\nRecruitment\nPatients from 18 to 70 years of age without associated respiratory comorbidity or immunosuppression, presenting respiratory infection of at least one week of evolution, with cough as the predominant symptoms and the presence of purulent expectoration of at least one week of duration and at least one other respiratory tract symptom such as dyspnoea, wheezing, chest discomfort or pain, with no alternative explanation such as pneumonic condensation, will be recruited from several healthcare centres in Catalonia.\nExclusion criteria will be: patients less than 18 and older than 70 years of age, the presence of radiological signs of pneumonia, signs of severe infection (confusion, tachypnoea &gt; 25 respirations per minute of tachycardia &gt; 120 beats per minute), history of digestive haemorrhage or intolerance to anti-inflammatory treatment, hypersensitivity to beta-lactams or intolerance to clavulanic acid or lactose, pregnancy, lactation and women of fertile age not using contraceptive measures, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory or corticosteroid use in the previous two weeks, associated comorbidity (bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, moderate-severe heart failure, dementia, stroke, immunosuppression or the use of immunosuppressive drugs), emergency situation, institutionalization in a residence, and/or subjects unable to personally provide informed consent.\nRandomization\nThe patients will be randomized with simple random numbers to one of the three following treatment arms:\n  Ibuprofen 600 mg/8 hours, during 10 days, taken after meals.\n  Amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 500-125 mg/8 hours, during 10 days, taken after meals.\n  Placebo, one tablet every 8 hours, during 10 days, taken after meals.\nThe use of acetaminophen will be allowed in cases of fever or pain, as will short life beta-adrenergics or anticholinergics in cases of bronchospasm and mucolytics, anti-cough and any medication that the patient may be taking for chronic disease and which has been initiated one month prior to inclusion in the study except for antibiotics, inhaled, oral or parenteral corticoids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In cases of clinical deterioration, the medical investigator will evaluate the need for hospitalisation and in the case of outpatient treatment, high dose antibiotic treatment with amoxycillin and clavulanic acid will be administered.\nThe patient will have to return all the medication samples not taken to the investigator. If the left over medication is not returned, adherence will be assessed as insufficient and the case will be classified as abandonment. Prescription adherence will be evaluated and will be considered satisfactory if the patient has taken at least 80% of the dose foreseen.\nMeasurements\nThe main outcome variable considered in this study is the number of days with frequent cough. Secondary result variables considered will be the efficacy of the treatment, the time of symptom resolution, the reduction in the total daily score of the symptom diary and the secondary effects and adverse reactions which may present with the three treatment arms. With regard to efficacy, three outcomes will be distinguished: cure, defined as the disappearance of the acute signs and symptoms related to the infection (complete return to the previous situation of stability), improvement, defined as the non-complete resolution of the symptoms and failure, with an insufficient reduction in the signs and symptoms of infection.\nThe following variables will be taken into account in this study:\n  Age, sex, presence of smoking, packets-year, presence of diabetes, heart failure, ischemic heart disease.\n  Treatment administered by the physician: mucolytics or expectorants, antihistaminics, bronchodilatadors, antitussives, analgesics.\n  Colour of the sputum: yellowish or yellowish-green.\n  Clinical manifestations of the patient: dyspnoea, wheezing on auscultation, chest discomfort, chest pain, pain (&gt;38 C).\n  Concentration of C-reactive protein in capillary blood, with quantitative apparatus (QuikRead of Orion Diagnostica).\n  Chest X-ray: will be considered positive if there is any complication such as pulmonary condensation (in which case, the patient will be excluded from the study); or negative.\n  Symptom diary: Five symptoms will be evaluated: disease severity, day-time cough, night-time cough, limitation in daily activity and febrile sensation. Each of the symptoms will be scored from 0 to 4. It will be recommended that the patient fill out this diary before going to bed. This symptom diary has previously been used in other studies.\n  Secondary effects and adverse reaction which might appear in the three treatment arms.\nFour visits have been established in this study (Table 1). On the baseline visit the study will be explained to the patient and informed consent will be requested. The scheme of the investigation will also be explained to the patient. The patients will be randomized to any of the three treatment groups and the medication will be given with 33 tablets (three extra tablets are given in case of loss). On this visit the C-reactive protein will be determined and a chest X-ray will be performed in cases with suspected pneumonia. In addition, a symptom diary will be given as will an explanation as to how to fill it in.\nStudy measurements\n	Baseline	2-4 days	11-13 days	30 days	 	Randomization	x				 		 	C-reactive protein	x				 		 	Chest X-ray	x				 		 	Hand-out of the symptom diary	x		x (1)		 		 	Side effects and adverse reactions assessment		x	x	x (1)	 		 	Evaluation of clinical evolution		x	x	x (1)	 		 	Review of adherence			x		 		 	Collection of symptom diary			x	x (2)	 	\n(1) If the patient continues to have symptomatology on day 11-13\n(2) If the patient has been given the second diary symptom\nThe first follow up visit will be programmed at 2-4 days. On this visit the presence of side effects and adverse reactions will be assessed. In addition, the clinical evolution of the symptoms and signs will be evaluated and, in the case of worsening of the symptoms, hospital referral or the administration of antibiotic treatment will be considered. The second follow up visit will be made at 11-13 days with a review of adherence to the study drug and an evaluation of the presence of side effects and adverse reactions. The patients classified as clinical failure will be managed as in the previous visit. The symptom diary will be collected and another diary will be given if the patient continues to have symptomatology. Patients classified as cure will finish the study on this visit and those classified as improvement will be given an appointment at 30 days of having initiated the treatment with a new diary, considering this as the last visit of the study.\nThe data of the study will be collected on a data collection sheet, a one-sided form sheet which the participating investigator will have identified with the number of randomization indicated on this sheet, on the symptom sheet given to the patient and on the medication bottle given to the patient. The randomization codes will be kept by the Pharmacy Unit of the Hospital Vall d'Hebron of Barcelona.\nSample size\nWe will accept a null hypothesis if the number of days of frequent cough in the anti-inflammatory arm is the same or +- 2 days as that observed in the other two treatment arms (placebo and antibiotic treatment). Based on the literature, the standard deviation of the duration of frequent cough is 5.5 days in patients with chronic bronchitis and purulent sputum. For an alpha: 0.05 and a beta: 0.2 and accepting possible losses of 15%, we calculate that the sample size should be of 140 patients per group (total of 420 patients).\nAnalysis\nIntention-to-treat statistical analyses will be performed. To analyse the time until cure of the different symptoms and for the main result variable (days from the onset of the picture until the patient scores a maximum of 1 in the box related to cough in the symptom diary) survival analysis will be carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison between the three survival curves will be undertaken using the log-rank test. In addition, bivariate analysis will be peformed with comparison of proportions using the chi-square test to evaluate secondary variables of the study and variance analysis to assess the relationship between quantitative variables for both independent and paired data.\nEthical considerations\nApproval has been obtained from the Ethical Committee of Investigation in Primary Care (Fundacio d'Investigacio en Atencio Primaria). The clinical trial has been registered in an international database (ISRCTN07852892). Informed consent will be requested from all the participants in the study, respecting subject autonomy in their decision. To achieve this, the medical investigator will read the informed consent sheet to the patients and clarify any doubt which might arise during the reading. Thereafter, patient comprehension of the information will be determined and, in the case of acceptation to participate, the patient will be asked to sign the form. This study does not require the use of unusual, additional tests: only a chest X-ray will be undertaken to rule out a pneumonic process and determination of the C-reactive protein during the visit to know the severity of the infection, being a test that is total justified in this project.\nFrom an ethical point of view, this is to certify that the objective of this study is important and relevant for primary care, the power of the study may be considered as reasonable, this is an original study, the risks which the participants may incur justify the investigation being carried out with a totally favourable benefit/risk quotient, and we ensure the external validity of the study to the primary care reality, with the inclusion and exclusion criteria described. Vulnerable populations will not participate in this study and neither will economic compensation be given to patients for their participation. The investigators are free to publish the results of this study, regardless of the results obtained. We guarantee the anonymity and confidentiality of the data, the protocol of the study will safeguard that in results of the study all the participants and their individual results will be taken into account. The privacy of the participants will be protected and with the randomised design of the study the subjects will be equally invited to participate and we consider that the possible benefits or adverse effects of the investigation will be equally shared among all the participants.\nDiscussion\nThis article presents a detailed description of a randomized clinical trial protocol study designed to explore the effectiveness of ibuprofen to alleviate the cough present in patients with acute bronchitis and purulent expectoration compared with a broad-spectrum antibiotic and placebo. The trial proposed is sufficiently powered and, to the best of our knowledge, the first to allow conclusions on the effect of an anti-inflammatory drug and compare it with antibiotic therapy. Acute bronchitis is a very prevalent disease and is one of the most frequent causes of medical visits in primary care. Patients often return to their physician or seek other medical help because the symptoms of the disease may persist for two or three weeks, mainly cough, which may be very bothersome for the patient. Many physicians may not give antibiotics on the first visit and may prescribe mucolytics and/or antitussives. However, since healthcare professionals often do not explain the natural evolution of bronchitis and since the patients are often told that these drugs will cure the patient, the patient returns with the same demand. Butler et al. reported similar results, with only 5% of the professionals explaining to their patients with bronchitis that the cough would last at least two weeks. When the patient returns and particularly when the patient presents purulent mucous expectoration, the physician is more likely to prescribe an antibiotic. Thus, only patients with acute bronchitis and yellowish-green expectoration will be included in this clinical trial.\nThis study will involve the use of drugs which have been in the pharmaceutical market for more than 20 years. Moreover, we will take into account the most commonly used drugs in Spain for each of the two pharmacological groups: ibuprofen among the anti-inflammatory drugs and amoxicillin and clavulanic acid as the antibiotic used in lower respiratory tract infections. This is, therefore, a phase IV clinical trial and, as such, we believe that important adverse effects will not be produced. This trial will deliver important findings on the effects of these drugs and the results will provide information on which of the two drugs produces the best results to alleviate cough using the symptom diary which the patients will be trained to fill in.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nCL, AM, CB, RM, HP, JMC, YF, MM, and AB designed this study protocol.

around this are placed seven categories of policy that could enable those interventions to occur.\n\n The BCW was used reliably to characterise interventions within the English Department of Health's 2010 tobacco control strategy and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence's guidance on reducing obesity.\n\n\nConclusions\nInterventions and policies to change behaviour can be usefully characterised by means of a BCW comprising: a 'behaviour system' at the hub, encircled by intervention functions and then by policy categories.\n\n Research is needed to establish how far the BCW can lead to more efficient design of effective interventions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3096582","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Michie","email":"s.michie@ucl.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maartje M","surname":"van Stralen","email":"MM.vanStralen@vumc.nl","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"West","email":"robertwest100@googlemail.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s13756-017-0170-7","date":"2017-01-04","title":"Behaviour change interventions to influence antimicrobial prescribing: a cross-sectional analysis of reports from UK state-of-the-art scientific conferences","abstract":"Background\nTo improve the quality of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions the application of behavioural sciences supported by multidisciplinary collaboration has been recommended.\n\n We analysed major UK scientific research conferences to investigate AMS behaviour change intervention reporting.\n\n\nMethods\nLeading UK 2015 scientific conference abstracts for 30 clinical specialties were identified and interrogated.\n\n All AMS and/or antimicrobial resistance(AMR) abstracts were identified using validated search criteria.\n\n Abstracts were independently reviewed by four researchers with reported behavioural interventions classified using a behaviour change taxonomy.\n\n\nResults\nConferences ran for 110 days with &gt;57,000 delegates.\n\n 311/12,313(2.5%) AMS-AMR abstracts (oral and poster) were identified.\n\n 118/311(40%) were presented at the UK’s infectious diseases/microbiology conference.\n\n 56/311(18%) AMS-AMR abstracts described behaviour change interventions.\n\n These were identified across 12/30(40%) conferences.\n\n The commonest abstract reporting behaviour change interventions were quality improvement projects [44/56 (79%)].\n\n In total 71 unique behaviour change functions were identified.\n\n Policy categories;

acute respiratory infections in trials in general practice, but the uptake in clinical practice is low.\n\n The aim of the study was to identify facilitators and barriers to general practitioners’ (GPs’) use of delayed prescribing and to gain pharmacists’ and the public’s views about delayed prescribing in Australia.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study used the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Behaviour Change Wheel to explore facilitators and barriers to delayed prescribing in Australia.\n\n Forty-three semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with general practitioners, pharmacists and patients were conducted.\n\n Responses were coded into domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework, and specific criteria from the Behaviour Change Wheel were used to identify which domains were relevant to increasing the use of delayed prescribing by GPs.\n\n\nResults\nThe interviews revealed nine key domains that influence GPs’ use of delayed prescribing: knowledge; cognitive and interpersonal skills; memory, attention and decision-making processes; optimism; beliefs about consequences; intentions; goals; emotion; and social influences: GPs knew about delayed prescribing; however, they did not use it consistently, preferring to bring patients back for review and only using it with patients in a highly selective way.\n\n Pharmacists would support GPs and the public in delayed prescribing but would fill the prescription if people insisted.\n\n The public said they would delay taking their antibiotics if asked by their GP and given the right information on managing symptoms and when to take antibiotics.\n\n\nConclusions\nUsing a theory-driven approach, we identified nine key domains that influence GPs’ willingness to provide a delayed prescription to patients with an acute respiratory infection presenting to general practice.\n\n These data can be used to develop a structured intervention to change this behaviour and thus reduce antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections in general practice.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12875-017-0589-1) contains supplementary material, which is

the views of parents, clinicians, and children pertaining to prescribing decisions for acute childhood infection in primary care.\n Methods.\n A systematic review of qualitative studies.\n Meta-ethnographic methods were used, with data drawn from the primary studies in an interpretive analysis.\n Results.\n A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria.\n The literature was dominated by concerns about antibiotic over-prescription.\n Children's views were not reported.\n Clinicians prescribed antibiotics when they felt pressured by parents or others (e.\ng.\n employers) to do so, when they believed there was a clear clinical indication, but also when they felt uncertain of clinical or social outcomes they prescribed “just in case”.\n Parents wanted antibiotics when they felt they would improve the current illness, and when they felt pressure from daycare providers or employers.\n Clinicians avoided antibiotics when they were concerned about adverse reactions or drug resistance, when certain they were not indicated, and when there was no perceived pressure from parents.\n Parents also wished to avoid adverse effects of antibiotics, and did not want antibiotics when they would not relieve current symptoms.\n Some parents preferred to avoid medication altogether.\n Within paediatric consultations, parents sought a medical evaluation and decision.\n Primary care clinicians want satisfied parents and short consultations.\n Conclusions.\n Antibiotic prescriptions for childhood infections in primary care often result from “just in case” prescribing.\n These findings suggest that interventions which reduce clinician uncertainty regarding social or clinical outcomes and provide strategies to meet parents’ needs within a short consultation are most likely to reduce antibiotic prescribing.\n","id":"PMC4377734","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Informa Healthcare","authors":[{"firstname":"Patricia

antibiotics in general practice: a pragmatic national randomised controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nUnnecessary antibiotic prescribing contributes to antimicrobial resistance.\n\n In this trial, we aimed to reduce unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics by general practitioners (GPs) in England.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this randomised, 2?×?2 factorial trial, publicly available databases were used to identify GP practices whose prescribing rate for antibiotics was in the top 20% for their National Health Service (NHS) Local Area Team.\n\n Eligible practices were randomly assigned (1:1) into two groups by computer-generated allocation sequence, stratified by NHS Local Area Team.\n\n Participants, but not investigators, were blinded to group assignment.\n\n On Sept 29, 2014, every GP in the feedback intervention group was sent a letter from England's Chief Medical Officer and a leaflet on antibiotics for use with patients.\n\n The letter stated that the practice was prescribing antibiotics at a higher rate than 80% of practices in its NHS Local Area Team.\n\n GPs in the control group received no communication.\n\n The sample was re-randomised into two groups, and in December, 2014, GP practices were either sent patient-focused information that promoted reduced use of antibiotics or received no communication.\n\n The primary outcome measure was the rate of antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 weighted population, controlling for past prescribing.\n\n Analysis was by intention to treat.\n\n This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN32349954, and has been completed.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Sept 8 and Sept 26, 2014, we recruited and assigned 1581 GP practices to feedback intervention (n=791) or control (n=790) groups.\n\n Letters were sent to 3227 GPs in the intervention group.\n\n Between October, 2014, and March, 2015, the rate of antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 population was 126·98 (95% CI 125·68–128·27) in the feedback intervention group and 131·25 (130·33–132·16) in the control group, a difference of 4·27 (3·3%; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·967 [95% CI 0·957–0·977]; p&lt;0·0001), representing an estimated 73?406 fewer antibiotic items dispensed.\n\n In December, 2014, GP practices were re-assigned to patient-focused intervention (n=777) or control (n=804) groups.\n\n The patient-focused intervention did not significantly affect the primary outcome measure between December, 2014, and March, 2015 (antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 population: 135·00 [95% CI 133·77–136·22] in the patient-focused intervention group and 133·98 [133·06–134·90] in the control group; IRR for difference between groups 1·01, 95% CI 1·00–1·02; p=0·105).\n\n\nInterpretation\nSocial norm feedback from a high-profile messenger can substantially reduce antibiotic prescribing at low cost and at national scale; this outcome makes it a worthwhile addition to antimicrobial stewardship programmes.\n\n\nFunding\nPublic
