In this context, autopsies are important to confirm the disease, determine associated conditions, and study the pathophysiology of this novel disease. The aim of this study was to assess the systemic involvement of COVID-19. In order to follow biosafety recommendations, we used ultrasound-guided minimally invasive autopsy (MIA-US), and we present the results of 10 initial autopsies.\nMethods and results\nWe used MIA-US for tissue sampling of the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, spleen, brain, skin, skeletal muscle and testis for histology, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA. All patients showed exudative/proliferative diffuse alveolar damage. There were intense pleomorphic cytopathic effects on the respiratory epithelium, including airway and alveolar cells. Fibrinous thrombi in alveolar arterioles were present in eight patients, and all patients showed a high density of alveolar megakaryocytes. Small thrombi were less frequently observed in the glomeruli, spleen, heart, dermis, testis, and liver sinusoids. The main systemic findings were associated with comorbidities, age, and sepsis, in addition to possible tissue damage due to the viral infection, such as myositis, dermatitis, myocarditis, and orchitis.\nConclusions\nMIA-US is safe and effective for the study of severe COVID-19. Our findings show that COVID-19 is a systemic disease causing major events in the lungs and with involvement of various organs and tissues. Pulmonary changes result from severe epithelial injury and microthrombotic vascular phenomena. These findings indicate that both epithelial and vascular injury should be addressed in therapeutic approaches.\nIntroduction\nThe beginning of 2020 has been marked by the expansion of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection pandemic [coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)], which started in China in late 2019. In Brazil, the first case was diagnosed on 25 February 2020, and the first death was recorded on 17 March 2020. At the time of writing, the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil is in its accelerating phase, with 61 888 confirmed cases and 4205 deaths (mortality rate of 6.8%) as of 26 April 2020. The State of Sao Paulo is the most affected region in the country, with the largest number of cases (20 715) and deaths (1700). \nClinically, severe COVID-19 presents as respiratory failure due to diffuse and bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Those with advanced age, obesity, diabetes mellitus and chronic cardiovascular, renal and pulmonary diseases are at higher risk for severe disease. Other causes of respiratory failure may be associated with or simulate COVID-19, and a non-invasive diagnostic approach, such as nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), can generate a large number of false negatives. This issue is even more critical in cases of death, as the actual mortality rate can be underestimated.\nIn this context, autopsies of patients who have suffered fatal COVID-19 allow pathologists to effectively confirm or exclude the disease and determine the associated conditions. Postmortem tissue sampling is also of paramount importance for conducting in-situ and molecular studies, and for detailed investigation of the pathophysiology of this new disease. However, the number of autopsies reported up to now is small, and tissue sampling is often limited to a few organs, mostly the lungs, liver, and heart. The scarce literature on COVID-19 autopsies markedly contrasts with the high number of deaths, probably because of the risk of contagion. In addition, strict protection procedures were recommended for autopsies of COVID-19 patients, restricting autopsies to a limited number of institutions. \nAs a rapid response and in preparedness for this new epidemic, our University Clinical Hospital (HC-FMUSP) was assigned to treat the patients with severe COVID-19 in the city of Sao Paulo, and we developed a procedure of ultrasound-based minimally invasive autopsy (MIA-US) to study the fatal cases. MIA-US had already been used during the recent 2018 yellow fever epidemic in Sao Paulo and showed full diagnostic agreement with the conventional autopsy. MIA-US is a suitable alternative for conducting autopsies on COVID-19 cases, because: it considerably reduces costs; the risk of producing aerosols is low and it can therefore be performed in services without negative-pressure autopsy rooms; the images obtained with ultrasound are sufficiently good to enable localisation and orientation of the sampling in several organs; and it provides information within a time window short enough to enable orientation of the management of critically ill patients. \nWith regard to the present pandemic scenario, we describe our MIA-US procedure, considering that its low cost and portability, combined with a significant reduction in the risk of contagion from a closed-body autopsy, could be a way to increase the rate of COVID-19 autopsies, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms of tissue injury and possibly adding useful information for the development of new therapeutic procedures. Here, we describe the MIA-US procedure and present the results of 10 COVID-19 autopsies.\nMaterials and methods\nThis is a case series study based on the autopsies of the first 10 fatal cases of COVID-19 who died at HC-FMUSP, from 18 March 2020 to 30 March 2020, in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This protocol was approved by the HC-FMUSP Ethical Committee (protocol no. 3951.904). The procedures were performed at the Image Platform in the Autopsy Room, a research centre in the University of Sao Paulo Medical School, located next to the Autopsy Service of Sao Paulo University (https://pisa.hc.fm.usp.br/). All of the autopsies were performed after informed consent had been obtained from the next of kin.\nThe case definition for confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the World Health Organization (WHO) is laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of clinical signs and symptoms. As the WHO has not yet incorporated the autopsy result in the case definition, considering the possibility of false-negative molecular test results and the absence of an alternative diagnosis for the cause of death, we extended the case definition to one patient with acute and fatal respiratory distress, with typical radiological and histological pulmonary changes, although the laboratory results were negative. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical charts.\nSafety Protocol\nThe bodies were transported in plastic safety bags from the hospital to the morgue by nurses with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Two trained technicians prepared the body for the procedure, covering it with an additional plastic bag, and sliding it through a stretcher with pulleys. Access to the autopsy room was limited to two people, the ultrasound examiner and the supporting technician, who wore PPE according to standard protocols (surgical clothing protected by two aprons, rubber boot, plastic sleeve, three layers of gloves, rubber cap, N95 mask under a surgical mask, and eye protection). After the procedure and release of the body to the morgue, the personnel involved directly with the MIA-US went to a support room to take off the PPE with the aid of protected technicians. The removal of rubbish and a terminal cleaning protocol for the autopsy room were performed by trained personnel. Plastic vials containing the sampled material had their external surfaces cleaned with 70% isopropyl alcohol solution. The personnel involved directly or indirectly with MIA-US were tested once weekly for COVID-19 (nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal RT-PCR). After 15 days of procedures, all team members tested negative.\nSampling Protocol\nWe used portable SonoSite M-Turbo R (Fujifilm, Bothell, WA, USA) ultrasound equipment with C60x (5-2 MHz Convex) multifrequency broadband transducers and DICOM standard images. We chose to employ this transducer because of its lower-frequency ultrasound waves, which allow a deeper visualisation of all organs, including the pulmonary parenchyma. The images obtained by ultrasound were used to localise and orient the sampling in several organs, and to select the most affected areas within each organ. Examples of those images are shown in Figure 1. After packing of the body with resistant plastic, small 10-cm openings were made at appropriate sites on the body surface. Initially, we accessed the heart and the left lung through an incision adjacent to the sternum. After completing the tissue sampling at this site, we accessed the right lung through an incision in the right parasternal area. The opening in the plastic wrap was closed, and subsequent incisions were performed in the right subcostal space (liver and right kidney) and left subcostal space (spleen and left kidney). Tissue sampling was performed with Tru-Cut semi-automatic coaxial needles (14G; 20 cm in length). The following tissue samples were collected under ultrasound guidance: lungs (eight samples from each lung for histology, and two lung samples for molecular analysis), liver (at least two samples), both kidneys (one sample each), spleen (one sample), and heart (one sample). Other tissues were sampled without direct image guidance: skeletal muscle (femoral quadriceps), skin (in the left thigh, with a 5-mm punch needle), and brain (trans-sphenoidal puncture).\nUltrasound-guided minimally invasive autopsy (MIA-US) in fatal cases of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). A, Lung ultrasonographic image from a COVID-19 case. The dark lines represent the interference of ribs with the ultrasound waves (dashed line). The pulmonary parenchyma shows different degrees of consolidation, in this case ranging from severe (triangles) up to intense consolidated areas (star), characterised by an uneven echogenic pattern. In this situation, it is possible to orient the sampling to areas showing distinct degrees of pulmonary involvement. B, Ultrasonographic aspect of the liver and kidney and the point of entrance of the Tru-cut needle (white arrow). This image shows that even a retroperitoneal organ can be assessed via the anterior abdominal wall. This increases the safety of MIA-US, as it avoids the dislocation of the body to a lateral position, reducing the contact with a potentially infected body surface.

D, Pulmonary tissue samples obtained by MIA-US, showing consolidation and few haemorrhagic areas (arrows, haematoxylin and eosin, low magnification).\nHistological and Immunohistochemistry Protocols\nTissue samples were fixed in buffered 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. A semiquantitative analysis was performed to grade pulmonary changes, whereby 0 = absence, 1 = mild, and 2 = intense.\nImmunohistochemistry was performed in the lung tissue for detection of the antigens thyroid transcription factor-1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; clone 8G7G3/1, 1:500 dilution), p63 (Biocare Medical, Pacheco, CA, USA; clone 4A4, 1:100 dilution), Ki67 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark; clone MIB-1, 1:400 dilution), CD4 (Leica Biosystems-Novocastra, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA; clone 4B12, 1:50 dilution), CD8 (Dako; clone C8/144B, 1:400 dilution), CD20 (Dako; clone L26, 1:2500 dilution), CD57 (Dako; clone TB01, 1:200 dilution), and CD68 (Dako; clone PG-M1, 1:2500 dilution). Antigen retrieval was performed with citrate at pH 6.0, except for p63 and CD4, for which antigen retrieval was performed with TRIS-EDTA at pH 9.0. The reactions followed standard protocols validated in our laboratories. \nMolecular Detection of SARS-CoV-2\nLung tissue samples measuring 1 cm3 were stored at -80 C. Tissue samples were macerated, and nucleic acid extraction was performed with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed with the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen), with primers/probes for E and RdRp gene amplification. qRT-PCR reactions were performed with the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), and consisted of 55 C for 10 min for reverse transcription, 95 C for 3 min, and 45 cycles of 95 C for 15 s and 58 C for 30 s. \nResults\nTable 1 shows the clinical data of the 10 patients. The patients comprised five women and five men, with a median age of 69 years (range, 33-83 years). The median timespan between the occurrence of symptoms and hospital admission was 4.5 days (range, 1-10 days), and the median total duration of disease was 10 days (range, 3-16 days). The most frequent associated clinical conditions were systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic ischaemic cardiopathy. All patients presented with severe respiratory distress. Three patients died within 24 h of hospitalisation; the other seven were admitted to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation. All but one patient had a positive RT-PCR result on the nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab and/or lung tissue.\nEpidemiological and clinical findings of 10 fatal cases of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)\nCharacteristic	Value	 	Female/male ratio	5:5	 	Age (years), median (range)	69 (33-83)	 	Previous medical history, n (%)	 	Systemic arterial hypertension	5 (50)	 	Diabetes mellitus	5 (50)	 	Chronic cardiopathy	5 (50)	 	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	3 (30)	 	Chronic renal disease	1 (10)	 	Neoplasia	1 (10)	 	Smoking, n (%)	 	Former smoker	4 (40)	 	Current smoker	1 (10)	 	Diagnosis of COVID-19, n (%)	 	Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab (RT-PCR)	7/9 (78)	 	Positive RT-PCR finding in the lung tissue	6/7 (86)	 	Hospitalisation	 	Time from symptom onset to hospital admission (days), median (range)	4.5 (1-10)	 	Time from symptom onset to death (days), median (range)	10 (3-16)	 	Period of hospitalisation (days), median (range)	5 (0-15)	 	Intensive care unit stay, n (%)	7 (70)	 	Period of mechanical ventilation, n = 7 (days), median (range)	5.5 (0-12)	 	Symptoms, n (%)	 	Fever	9 (90)	 	Dyspnoea	9 (90)	 	Cough	6 (60)	 	Diarrhoea	2 (20)	 	Nausea/vomiting	2 (20)	 	Myalgia	1 (10)	 	Running nose	1 (10)	 	Sore throat	1 (10)	 	Laboratory tests, median (range)	 	Total blood white cells	15 045 (4980-43 900)	 	Lymphocytes	545 (175-1005)	 	pH	7.39 (7.16-7.48)	 	Po2 (mmHg)	128 (118-138)	 	Pco2 (mmHg)	35.6 (31.2-46.1)	 	HCO3 (mmol/l)	21.4 (15.2-25.8)	 	C-reactive protein (mg/l)	8.12 (23-110.5)	 	D-dimer* (ng/ml)	(28.435-89.513)	 	\nRT-PCR, Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\nReference ranges are as follows.

All 10 patients showed a histological picture of exudative/proliferative diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Exudative DAD was mainly characterised by intense and diffuse alveolar exudates with hyaline membranes, septal oedema, and mild/moderate lymphocytic infiltration. There were intense pleomorphic changes on alveolar epithelial cells, suggestive of virus cytopathic effects, with diffuse epithelial desquamation. Epithelial changes included enlarged and distorted cytoplasm, large nuclei, eosinophilic nucleoli, giant cells, and also many foci of squamous alveolar metaplasia (present in six cases), which extended throughout the respiratory epithelium, including both the airways and alveolar tissue (Figures 2 and 3). Ki67 expression in alveolar and bronchiolar cells indicated a high index of epithelial cell proliferation (Figure 3E,F). Proliferative DAD was characterised by poorly organised fibrous tissue within alveolar septa and the alveolar lumen, and was more prevalent in patients with long periods of illness and hospitalisation (Figure 2B). A striking finding was the presence of fibrinous thrombi in alveolar arterioles (eight patients) and a high density of alveolar megakaryocytes (Figure 2G,H). Secondary suppurative pneumonia was present in six of 10 patients (Figure 2I).\nSemiquantitative analysis of the main pulmonary histological changes in 10 fatal cases of coronavirus disease19 (COVID-19)\nCase	Exudative DAD	Proliferative DAD	Cytopathic effects	Alveolar squamous metaplasia	Septal lymphocytic inflammation	Arteriolar microthrombi	Alveolar megakaryocytes	Alveolar haemorrhage	Suppurative pneumonia	Time from symptom onset to death (days)	Period of hospitalisation (days)	 	1	1	0	2	0	1	0	2	0	2	5	2	 	2	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	2	3	0	 	3	2	1	2	0	1	1	2	1	1	10	1	 	4	2	0	2	1	1	1	2	1	2	10	0	 	5	2	1	2	2	1	1	1	0	2	13	8	 	6	2	1	2	1	1	1	2	0	2	8	5	 	7	1	2	2	0	2	1	2	0	0	11	8	 	8	1	2	2	1	2	1	2	1	0	16	15	 	9	1	2	1	1	2	2	2	0	0	16	11	 	10	1	2	2	1	2	0	2	0	0	7	5	 	\n0 = absence; 1 = mild; 2 = intense.\nPulmonary histological features of 10 fatal cases of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), autopsied by the use of ultrasound-guided minimally invasive autopsy.

The positive p63 staining (D) indicates that the metaplasia is probably the result of bronchiolar basal cell proliferation in response to epithelial insult. E-F, Ki67 expression in alveolar (E) and bronchiolar (F) cells indicates a high index of epithelial cell proliferation.\nLung tissue immunostaining revealed a paucity of CD20+ B cells in all cases, and no signs of lymphoid aggregate formation. For the T-cell markers, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells varied from scarce, especially in the cases with exudative DAD, to moderate, forming small aggregates in the patients with fibroproliferative DAD. CD57+ natural killer (NK) cells were sparse in all cases, and did not vary according to DAD patterns. CD68+ macrophages were present mostly in the alveolar spaces and within areas of tissue remodelling in fibroproliferative areas. Some multinucleated atypical giant cells were CD68+ alveolar macrophages.\nThe extrapulmonary findings can be divided into three categories, as shown in Table 3 and Figure 4: (i) findings attributed to comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, i.e. renal arteriolosclerosis (10 cases), cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (nine cases), myocardial fibrosis (nine cases), focal glomerular sclerosis (seven cases), liver steatosis (six cases), and cerebral small-vessel disease (three cases); (ii) findings attributed to shock, i.e. centrilobular congestion in the liver (10 cases) and acute tubular lesion (in all eight kidney samples); and (iii) findings that have uncertain aetiology, i.e. secondary to infection with SARS-CoV-2, systemic inflammation, or shock, i.e. superficial perivascular mononuclear infiltrate in the skin (eight cases); myositis (two cases); orchitis (two cases); mild lymphomononuclear myocarditis (two cases); endothelial changes in small vessels (cell tumefaction, vessel wall oedema, and fibrinoid alteration); fibrin microthrombi in glomeruli (six cases), skin (three cases), testis (two cases), liver sinusoids (one case), and heart (two cases); and other changes such as mesangial glomerulopathy, reactive Kupffer cells in the liver, lymphoid hypoplasia in the spleen, and reactive gliosis in the brain.\nHistological findings in extrapulmonary organs in 10 fatal cases of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)\nFindings	N (%)	 	Heart	 	Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy	9 (90)	 	Myocardial fibrosis	9 (90)	 	Previous myocardial infarction	4 (44.4)	 	Interstitial oedema	9 (90)	 	Myocarditis	2 (20)	 	Fibrin thrombi	2 (20)	 	Kidneys (n = 8)	 	Glomerular shrinkage	8 (100)	 	Fibrin thrombi	6 (75)	 	Focal mesangial proliferation and mesangial matrix expansion	8 (100)	 	Focal glomerular sclerosis	7 (87.5)	 	Acute tubular lesion	8 (100)	 	Hyaline tubular casts	6 (75)	 	Pigmented tubular casts	1 (12.5)	 	Arteriolosclerosis	8 (100)	 	Liver	 	Steatosis of hepatocytes	6 (60)	 	Portal tract inflammatory infiltrate	9 (90)	 	Centrilobular congestion	10 (100)	 	Ischaemic necrosis	3 (30)	 	Kupffer cell hypertrophy	5 (50)	 	Kupffer cell haemophagocytosis	3 (30)	 	Sinusoids with neutrophilic infiltrate	6 (60)	 	Brain (n = 9)	 	Reactive gliosis	8 (89)	 	Neuronal satellitosis	5 (55.5)	 	Small-vessel disease	3 (33.3)	 	Perivascular haemorrhage	1 (11.1)	 	Spleen (n = 5)	 	Lymphoid hypoplasia	5 (100)	 	Red pulp haemorrhage	3 (60)	 	Splenitis	2 (40)	 	Extramedullary haematopoiesis	5 (50)	 	Endothelial changes (follicular arterioles	4 (80)	 	Vasculitis and arterial thrombus	1 (20)	 	Skin	 	Superficial perivascular mononuclear infiltrate	8 (80)	 	Purpura	1 (10)	 	Endothelial changes	3 (30)	 	Skeletal muscles	 	Myositis	6 (60)	 	Necrotic fibres	8 (80)	 	Testis (n = 2)	 	Orchitis	2 (100)	 	\nExtrapulmonary histological features of 10 fatal cases of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), autopsied by the use of ultrasound-guided minimally invasive autopsy.

It represents a response by local pathologists to deal with a pandemic disease with a large number of deaths, which has caused unprecedented social and economic disruption and has had severe effects on health systems worldwide. When we started this study, knowledge of the pathology of COVID-19 was scarce, with few reports of isolated cases. Postmortem examinations became necessary to understand the pathophysiology of the disease and to contribute to therapeutic decisions. We adopted the MIA-US approach because, in our institution, we do not have an autopsy room that complies with the appropriate biosafety recommendations. \nMIA-US provides fast, precise responses to investigate the pathogenesis of new infectious agents, and thus represents a valuable alternative to conventional autopsies in situations of high contagiousness. Also, it has great portability and considerably reduces autopsy costs, which are considerations that are becoming increasingly important as the world faces financial distress; the risk of producing aerosols is low, so it can be performed in areas without negative-pressure autopsy rooms; the images obtained with ultrasound are good enough to enable localisation and orientation of the sampling in several organs, and selection of the most affected areas within each organ; and it provides information within a time window that is short enough to enable orientation of the management of critically ill patients. Tissues from patients who died from COVID-19 have been used in our hospital to characterise the pathological aspects of respiratory failure, as well as the systemic manifestations of this new disease, producing useful feedback for the staff dealing with critical patients. The combination of the aspects mentioned above may increase the possibility of performing autopsies in different parts of the world, perhaps helping us to understand the local characteristics of COVID-19 within a wide range of genetic, social and economic situations.\nWe present here the results of the first autopsies of COVID-19 performed in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Most of our patients had characteristics that favoured a poor outcome of the disease, such as advanced age, diabetes, and arterial hypertension. A patient with negative RT-PCR findings for both the nasopharynx and the lung was from an area of Sao Paulo with a high COVID-19 prevalence and a high number of cases, and had a clinical, radiological and histological picture compatible with COVID-19. The negative RT-PCR findings in this patient may have resulted from the long time course from disease onset to death (16 days).\nThe main pulmonary injury in COVID-19 is exudative/proliferative DAD. There are severe alveolar epithelial changes, which seem to be more intense and prevalent than those observed for other respiratory viruses. Virus-induced epithelial changes extend throughout the respiratory epithelium, including both the airways and alveolar tissue, indicating an extension of the epithelial involvement probably from the most central airways towards the alveolar territory in severe cases of the disease. DAD features in COVID-19 are similar to those previously reported in the two previous coronavirus outbreaks:SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS):and more intense than those reported for other respiratory viruses, such as 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1pdm). There are a few reports on the autopsy findings of MERS patients, describing exudative DAD, with type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, rare multinucleated syncytial cells, and alveolar septa involved by oedema and lymphocytes. No evident viral inclusions were seen. Autopsy studies on fatal SARS cases reported DAD with prominent cytopathic changes in pneumocytes, giant cells, hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia of bronchi, and foci of organising pneumonia. Thrombi were seen in a variable number of cases. We have previously reported the pathology and lung immunoprofile of H1N1pdm cases, which showed a different histopathological picture and possibly a different immunoprofile from COVID-19. In H1N1pdm lungs, extensive necrosis and haemorrhage were present; these are much less prominent or even absent in COVID-19 cases. In addition, a cytotoxic type of inflammation predominated in H1N1pdm cases, with CD8+ T cells, CD57+ NK cells, and granzyme B+ cells. In COVID-19 cases, we and others have described a paucity of CD8+ and CD57+ NK cells in the alveolar septa, indicating CD8+ T-cell lymphocyte depletion also in the lungs, as seen in the lymphoid organs (spleen and lymph nodes) and peripheral blood. \nIn our present series, distal bronchioles showed extensive areas of metaplastic epithelium with intense epithelial changes and high proliferation rates. Pathogenic coronaviruses are efficient replicators within ciliated cells of the respiratory tract, which secrete high titres of virus after infection. Considering also the widespread human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression throughout the airways, this provides a suitable substrate for repeated cycles of virus amplification and spread through the respiratory epithelium, reaching the alveolar region. Immature squamous metaplasia in both the distal airways and in alveoli, as seen here, is probably a reflection of the proliferation of bronchiolar basal cells in response to the epithelial insult, as indicated by the positive p63 staining in these areas. The disorganised architecture and dysplastic changes of respiratory epithelial cells could be direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on these cells. A previous study of SARS coronavirus demonstrated that coronavirus E protein alters the formation of tight junctions and, as a consequence, epithelial morphogenesis. \nAnother striking finding was the presence of fibrinous thrombi in alveolar arterioles in a high proportion of our patients (80%) and a high density of alveolar megakaryocytes. We have previously reported these observations as preliminary findings, and they are considered to constitute morphological evidence of a hypercoagulative state present in some of the severely ill COVID-19 patients. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that thrombotic phenomena in patients with severe COVID-19 can involve the pulmonary and systemic arteries, leading to a severe ventilation-perfusion mismatch in the lungs and peripheral ischaemic events. The mechanisms involved in the inflammatory and/or virus-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and in the increase in the density of alveolar megakaryocytes in COVID-19 patients have yet to be determined. Previous studies have demonstrated that functional Toll-like receptor 3 is expressed in megakaryocytes and platelets, suggesting a role for this receptor in the megakaryopoiesis/thrombopoiesis alterations in viral infections. \nPrevious reports of autopsy series of COVID-19 patients have also shown that exudative DAD is a major finding. A mixed pattern of exudative/proliferative DAD, observed in most of our patients and also by others, indicates the progression of the lung injury, probably related to both the temporal evolution of the injury and the effects of mechanical ventilation. Three of our patients showed a mixed pattern of DAD, even with a short period from symptom onset to death. Although there is a direct relationship between the duration of DAD and fibroproliferation, fibroproliferative changes may start early in the course of the disease. Secondary bacterial pneumonia, which was a frequent finding in our series, has also been described in other reports. \nThe main extrapulmonary findings are related to comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and also reflect changes associated with septic shock (splenitis, neutrophilic infiltration in the hepatic sinusoids, and lymphoid hypoplasia). However, it is likely that some changes in other organs can be attributed to viral disease:superficial perivascular dermatitis, myositis, orchitis, myocarditis, and alterations in the renal glomeruli, endothelium of small vessels, and cerebral cortex. Further analysis, with the help of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, is needed to define the role of SARS-CoV-2 in their pathogenesis, as well as to validate results obtained by other authors. \nWe conclude that MIA-US is a safe, rapid and effective procedure for obtaining the main organs and tissues for the study of severe COVID-19. Our findings show that COVID-19 is a systemic disease with major effects in the lungs and the involvement of various organs and tissues, such as the kidneys, spleen, lymph nodes, brain, testicles, and skin. Pulmonary changes in fatal cases result from severe epithelial injury and microthrombotic vascular phenomena, which cause ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxaemia, leading to respiratory failure. These findings indicate that both epithelial injury and vascular injury should be addressed in therapeutic approaches.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest.\nAuthor contributions\nA.

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·031·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·6112·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·024·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

The pericytes injury due to virus infection may result in capillary endothelial cells dysfunction, inducing microvascular dysfunction.\n And patients with basic heart failure disease showed increased ACE2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, meaning that if infected by the virus these patients may have higher risk of heart attack and critically ill condition.\n The finding of this study explains the high rate of severe cases among COVID-19 patients with basic cardiovascular disease; and these results also perhaps provide important reference to clinical treatment of cardiac injury

infections reproduced in several animal models of pulmonary bacterial infections.\n Direct interactions between platelets and bacteria have been associated with increased pulmonary platelet accumulation, whereas bacterial-derived toxins have also been reported to modulate platelet function.\n Recently, platelets have been found extravascular in the lungs of patients with asthma, and in animal models of allergic lung inflammation.\n Their ability to interact with immune and endothelial cells and secrete immune mediators makes them one attractive target for biomarker identification

potential in Africa: a multistage analysis","abstract":"Background\nPredicting when and where pathogens will emerge is difficult, yet, as shown by the recent Ebola and Zika epidemics, effective and timely responses are key.\n\n It is therefore crucial to transition from reactive to proactive responses for these pathogens.\n\n To better identify priorities for outbreak mitigation and prevention, we developed a cohesive framework combining disparate methods and data sources, and assessed subnational pandemic potential for four viral haemorrhagic fevers in Africa, CrimeanCongo haemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, Lassa fever, and Marburg virus disease.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this multistage analysis, we quantified three stages underlying the potential of widespread viral haemorrhagic fever epidemics.\n\n Environmental suitability maps were used to define stage 1, index-case potential, which assesses populations at risk of infection due to spillover from zoonotic hosts or vectors, identifying where index cases could present.\n\n Stage 2, outbreak potential, iterates upon an existing framework, the Index for Risk Management, to measure potential for secondary spread in people within specific communities.\n\n For stage 3, epidemic potential, we combined local and international scale connectivity assessments with stage 2 to evaluate possible spread of local outbreaks nationally, regionally, and internationally.\n\n\nFindings\nWe found epidemic potential to vary within Africa, with regions where viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks have previously occurred (eg, western Africa) and areas currently considered non-endemic (eg, Cameroon and Ethiopia) both ranking highly.\n\n Tracking transitions between stages showed how an index case can escalate into a widespread epidemic in the absence of intervention (eg, Nigeria and Guinea).\n\n Our analysis showed Chad, Somalia, and South Sudan to be highly susceptible to any outbreak at subnational levels.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur analysis provides a unified assessment of potential epidemic trajectories, with the aim of allowing national and international agencies to pre-emptively evaluate needs and target resources.\n\n Within each country, our framework identifies at-risk subnational locations in which to improve surveillance, diagnostic capabilities, and health systems in parallel with the design of policies for optimal responses at each stage.\n\n In conjunction with pandemic preparedness activities, assessments such as ours can identify regions where needs and provisions do not align, and thus should be targeted for future strengthening and support.\n\n\nFunding\nPaul G Allen Family Foundation, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, UK Department for International

virus, 15(0.9%) forWest Nile virus and 7 (0.4%) for Zika virus by PRNT.\n\n Three out of the five ecological zones namely zones 1, 3 and 5 showed low levels (&lt;?2%) of IgG positivity against YFV.\n\n A total of 41(2.5%) cases were confirmed to be positive for one of flaviviruses tested.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Based on the seroprevalence data, the level of YFV activity and the risk of a YF epidemic in Ethiopia are low.\n\n However additional factors that could impact the likelihood of such an epidemic occurring should be considered before making final recommendations for YF prevention and control in Ethiopia.\n\n Based on the results of the serosurvey and other YF epidemic risk factors considered, a preventive mass vaccination campaign is not recommended, however the introduction of YF vaccine in routine EPI is proposed nationwide, along with strong laboratory based YF surveillance.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6092792","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

adults in South Africa: Comparing verbal autopsy, minimally-invasive autopsy, and research data","abstract":"Background\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) aims to reduce tuberculosis (TB) deaths by 95% by 2035; tracking progress requires accurate measurement of TB mortality.\n\n International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes do not differentiate between HIV-associated TB and HIV more generally.\n\n Verbal autopsy (VA) is used to estimate cause of death (CoD) patterns but has mostly been validated against a suboptimal gold standard for HIV and TB.\n\n This study, conducted among HIV-positive adults, aimed to estimate the accuracy of VA in ascertaining TB and HIV CoD when compared to a reference standard derived from a variety of clinical sources including, in some, minimally-invasive autopsy (MIA).\n\n\nMethods and findings\nDecedents were enrolled into a trial of empirical TB treatment or a cohort exploring diagnostic algorithms for TB in South Africa.\n\n The WHO 2012 instrument was used; VA CoD were assigned using physician-certified VA (PCVA), InterVA-4, and SmartVA-Analyze.\n\n Reference CoD were assigned using MIA, research, and health facility data, as available.\n\n 259 VAs were completed: 147 (57%) decedents were female; median age was 39 (interquartile range [IQR] 3347) years and CD4 count 51 (IQR 22102) cells/?L.\n\n Compared to reference CoD that included MIA (n = 34), VA underestimated mortality due to HIV/AIDS (94% reference, 74% PCVA, 47% InterVA-4, and 41% SmartVA-Analyze; chance-corrected concordance [CCC] 0.71, 0.42, and 0.31, respectively) and HIV-associated TB (41% reference, 32% PCVA; CCC 0.23).\n\n For individual decedents, all VA methods agreed poorly with reference CoD that did not include MIA (n = 259; overall CCC 0.14, 0.06, and 0.15 for PCVA, InterVA-4, and SmartVA-Analyze); agreement was better at population level (cause-specific mortality fraction accuracy 0.78, 0.61, and 0.57, for the three methods, respectively).\n\n\nConclusions\nCurrent VA methods underestimate mortality due to HIV-associated TB.\n\n ICD and VA methods need modifications that allow for more specific evaluation of HIV-related deaths and direct estimation of mortality due to HIV-associated TB.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5363862","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Aaron

targeted coronary angiography versus autopsy for coroner-requested post-mortem investigations: a prospective, masked, comparison study","abstract":"Background\nEngland and Wales have one of the highest frequencies of autopsy in the world.\n\n Implementation of post-mortem CT (PMCT), enhanced with targeted coronary angiography (PMCTA), in adults to avoid invasive autopsy would have cultural, religious, and potential economic benefits.\n\n We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of PMCTA as a first-line technique in post-mortem investigations.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centre (Leicester, UK), prospective, controlled study, we selected cases of natural and non-suspicious unnatural death referred to Her Majesty's (HM) Coroners.\n\n We excluded cases younger than 18 years, known to have had a transmittable disease, or who weighed more than 125 kg.\n\n Each case was assessed by PMCTA, followed by autopsy.\n\n Pathologists were masked to the PMCTA findings, unless a potential risk was shown.\n\n The primary endpoint was the accuracy of the cause of death diagnosis from PMCTA against a gold standard of autopsy findings, modified by PMCTA findings only if additional substantially incontrovertible findings were identified.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Jan 20, 2010, and Sept 13, 2012, we selected 241 cases, for which PMCTA was successful in 204 (85%).\n\n Seven cases were excluded from the analysis because of procedural unmasking or no autopsy data, as were 24 cases with a clear diagnosis of traumatic death before investigation; 210 cases were included.\n\n In 40 (19%) cases, predictable toxicology or histology testing accessible by PMCT informed the result.\n\n PMCTA provided a cause of death in 193 (92%) cases.\n\n A major discrepancy with the gold standard was noted in 12 (6%) cases identified by PMCTA, and in nine (5%) cases identified by autopsy (because of specific findings on PMCTA).\n\n The frequency of autopsy and PMCTA discrepancies were not significantly different (p=0·65 for major discrepancies and p=0·21 for minor discrepancies).\n\n Cause of death given by PMCTA did not overlook clinically significant trauma, occupational lung disease, or reportable disease, and did not significantly affect the overall population data for cause of death (p?0·31).\n\n PMCTA was better at identifying trauma and haemorrhage (p=0·008), whereas autopsy was better at identifying pulmonary thromboembolism (p=0·004).\n\n\nInterpretation\nFor most sudden natural adult deaths investigated by HM Coroners, PMCTA could be used to avoid invasive autopsy.\n\n The gold standard of post-mortem investigations should include both PMCT and invasive autopsy.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute for Health

virus detection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared seven published real-time RTPCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.\n\n To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RTPCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5?×?104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2?×?104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains.\n\n Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains.\n\n Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative results.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5153932","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"World Health Organization","authors":[{"firstname":"Victor

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by SARS.\n","id":"PMC6181990","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be

regulation in murine embryonic stem cells","abstract":"Background\nRecent work has revealed that a core group of transcription factors (TFs) regulates the key characteristics of embryonic stem (ES) cells: pluripotency and self-renewal.\n\n Current efforts focus on identifying genes that play important roles in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal in ES cells and aim to understand the interactions among these genes.\n\n To that end, we investigated the use of unsigned and signed network analysis to identify pluripotency and differentiation related genes.\n\n\nResults\nWe show that signed networks provide a better systems level understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of ES cells than unsigned networks, using two independent murine ES cell expression data sets.\n\n Specifically, using signed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we found a pluripotency module and a differentiation module, which are not identified in unsigned networks.\n\n We confirmed the importance of these modules by incorporating genome-wide TF binding data for key ES cell regulators.\n\n Interestingly, we find that the pluripotency module is enriched with genes related to DNA damage repair and mitochondrial function in addition to transcriptional regulation.\n\n Using a connectivity measure of module membership, we not only identify known regulators of ES cells but also show that Mrpl15, Msh6, Nrf1, Nup133, Ppif, Rbpj, Sh3gl2, and Zfp39, among other genes, have important roles in maintaining ES cell pluripotency and self-renewal.\n\n We also report highly significant relationships between module membership and epigenetic modifications (histone modifications and promoter CpG methylation status), which are known to play a role in controlling gene expression during ES cell self-renewal and differentiation.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur systems biologic re-analysis of gene expression, transcription factor binding, epigenetic and gene ontology data provides a novel integrative view of ES cell biology.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2727539","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Mike

replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and

diseases and death are unknown.\n To address this question, we evaluated the role of innate immune signaling in protection from human (Urbani) and a recombinant mouse adapted SARS-CoV, designated rMA15. In contrast to most models of viral pathogenesis, infection of type I, type II or type III interferon knockout mice (129 background) with either Urbani or MA15 viruses resulted in clinical disease outcomes, including transient weight loss, denuding bronchiolitis and alveolar inflammation and recovery, identical to that seen in infection of wildtype mice.\n This suggests that type I, II and III interferon signaling play minor roles in regulating SARS pathogenesis in mouse models.\n In contrast, infection of STAT1?/? mice resulted in severe disease, high virus titer, extensive pulmonary lesions and 100% mortality by day 9 and 30 post-infection with rMA15 or Urbani viruses, respectively.\n Non-lethal in BALB/c mice, Urbani SARS-CoV infection in STAT1?/? mice caused disseminated infection involving the liver, spleen and other tissues after day 9. These findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV pathogenesis is regulated by a STAT1 dependent but type I, II and III interferon receptor independent, mechanism.\n In contrast to a well documented role in

more than 700 deaths worldwide.\n Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear.\n Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice.\n In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection.\n Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88?/?), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection.\n The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection.\n MyD88?/? mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection.\n Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88?/? mice compared to wild-type mice.\n Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88?/?mice.\n These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung are required for protection from lethal rMA15

Clinical complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 81%), cardiac failure (50%), elevated aminotransaminases (43%), and renal dysfunction (17%).\n\n Fatal cases had a lower median nadir platelet count (64.5×109 cells/L vs 93.0×109 cells/L, p?=?0.02), higher median peak lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level (1982.5 U/L vs 1230.0 U/L, p?=?0.001), higher percentage of ARDS (94%

Network of gene interactions.\n\n Additional analysis of the data is conducted by training support vector machines (SVM) with the data and examining the orientations of the optimal hyperplanes generated.\n\n\nResults\nAnalysis of gene clustering in the Gene Ontology shows no significant clustering of genes unique to H5N1 response at 8 hours post infection.\n\n At 24 hours post infection, however, a number of significant gene clusters are found for nodes representing 'immune response' and 'response to virus' terms.\n\n There were no significant clusters of genes in the Gene Ontology

pneumonia in humans.\n The pathogenesis of HPAIV H5N1 infection is not completely understood, although the alveolar macrophage (AM) is thought to play an important role.\n HPAIV H5N1 infection of macrophages cultured from monocytes leads to high percentages of infection accompanied by virus production and an excessive pro-inflammatory immune response.\n However, macrophages cultured from monocytes are different from AM, both in phenotype and in response to seasonal influenza virus infection.\n Consequently, it remains unclear whether the results of studies with macrophages cultured from monocytes are valid for AM.\n Therefore we infected AM and for comparison macrophages cultured from monocytes with seasonal H3N2 virus, HPAIV H5N1 or pandemic H1N1 virus, and determined the percentage of cells infected, virus production and induction of TNF-alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine.\n In vitro HPAIV H5N1 infection of AM compared to that of macrophages cultured from monocytes resulted in a lower percentage of infected cells (up to 25% vs up to 84%), lower virus production and lower TNF-alpha induction.\n In vitro infection of AM with H3N2 or H1N1 virus resulted in even lower percentages of infected cells (up to 7%) than with HPAIV H5N1, while virus production and TNF-alpha induction were comparable.\n In conclusion, this study reveals that macrophages cultured from monocytes are not a good model to study the interaction between AM and these influenza virus strains.\n Furthermore, the interaction between HPAIV H5N1 and AM could contribute to the pathogenicity of this virus in humans, due to the relative high percentage of infected cells rather than virus production or an excessive TNF-alpha

Pandemic Influenza Virus Infection Results in Early and Excessive Infiltration of Macrophages and Neutrophils in the Lungs of Mice","abstract":"Fatal human respiratory disease associated with the 1918 pandemic influenza virus and potentially pandemic H5N1 viruses is characterized by severe lung pathology, including pulmonary edema and extensive inflammatory infiltrate.\n Here, we quantified the cellular immune response to infection in the mouse lung by flow cytometry and demonstrate that mice infected with highly pathogenic (HP) H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses exhibit significantly high numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs compared to mice infected with low pathogenic (LP) viruses.\n Mice infected with the 1918 pandemic virus and a recent H5N1 human isolate show considerable similarities in overall lung cellularity, lung immune cell sub-population composition and cellular immune temporal dynamics.\n Interestingly, while these similarities were observed, the HP H5N1 virus consistently elicited significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in whole lungs and primary human macrophages, revealing a potentially critical difference in the pathogenesis of H5N1 infections.\n These results together show that infection with HP influenza viruses such as H5N1 and the 1918 pandemic virus leads to a rapid cell recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils into the lungs, suggesting that these cells play a role in acute lung inflammation associated with HP influenza virus infection.\n In addition, primary macrophages and dendritic cells were also susceptible to 1918 and H5N1 influenza virus infection in vitro and in infected mouse lung tissue.\n","id":"PMC2483250","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

the ability of the virus to circumvent innate immunity.\n Using functional genomics, we analyzed early host responses to SARS-CoV infection in the lungs of adolescent cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that show lung pathology similar to that observed in human adults with SARS.\n Analysis of gene signatures revealed induction of a strong innate immune response characterized by the stimulation of various cytokine and chemokine genes, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IP-10, which corresponds to the host response seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n As opposed to many in vitro experiments, SARS-CoV induced a wide range of type I interferons (IFNs) and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in the lungs of macaques.\n Using immunohistochemistry, we revealed that these antiviral signaling pathways were differentially regulated in distinctive subsets of cells.\n Our studies emphasize that the induction of early IFN signaling may be critical to confer protection against SARS-CoV infection and highlight the strength of combining functional genomics with immunohistochemistry to further unravel the pathogenesis of SARS.\n","id":"PMC1941749","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"de

fibrotic lung diseases and loss of function.\n Thus, resolution of lung injury must be tightly regulated.\n The key regulatory proteins required for tightly controlling the resolution of lung injury have yet to be identified.\n Here we show that loss of deubiquitinase CYLD led to the development of lung fibrosis in mice after infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n CYLD inhibited transforming growth factor-?-signalling and prevented lung fibrosis by decreasing the stability of Smad3 in an E3 ligase carboxy terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein-dependent manner.\n Moreover, CYLD decreases Smad3 stability by deubiquitinating K63-polyubiquitinated Akt.\n Together, our results unveil a role for CYLD in tightly regulating the resolution of lung injury and preventing fibrosis by

Efficacy in Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoVchallenged mice.\n\n VRP-Ninduced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

disease 2019 develop the acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring admission to the ICU.\n\n This study aimed to describe specific pathophysiological characteristics of acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019.\nDesign:\nProspective crossover physiologic study.\n\n\nSetting:\nICU of a university-affiliated hospital from northern Italy dedicated to care of patients with confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019.\nPatients:\nTen intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019.\nInterventions:\nWe performed a two-step positive end-expiratory pressure trial with change of 10 cm H2O in random order.\n\n\nMeasurements and Main Results:\nAt each positive end-expiratory pressure level, we assessed arterial blood gases, respiratory mechanics, ventilation inhomogeneity, and potential for lung recruitment by electrical impedance tomography.\n\n Potential for lung recruitment was assessed by the recently described recruitment to inflation ratio.\n\n In a subgroup of seven paralyzed patients, we also measured ventilation-perfusion mismatch at lower positive end-expiratory pressure by electrical impedance tomography.\n\n At higher positive end-expiratory pressure, respiratory mechanics did not change significantly: compliance remained relatively high with low driving pressure.\n\n Oxygenation and ventilation inhomogeneity improved but arterial co2 increased despite unchanged respiratory rate and tidal volume.\n\n The recruitment to inflation ratio presented median value higher than previously reported in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients but with large variability (median, 0.79 [0.531.08]; range, 0.161.40).\n\n The Fio2 needed to obtain viable oxygenation at lower positive end-expiratory pressure was significantly correlated with the recruitment to inflation ratio (r = 0.603; p = 0.05).\n\n The ventilation-perfusion mismatch was elevated (median, 34% [3245%] of lung units) and, in six out of seven patients, ventilated nonperfused units represented a much larger proportion than perfused nonventilated ones.\n\n\nConclusions:\nIn patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019, potential for lung recruitment presents large variability, while elevated dead space fraction may be a specific pathophysiological trait.\n\n These findings may guide selection of personalized mechanical ventilation settings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7188034","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott Williams &amp;

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Findings confirm that COVID-19 is a systemic disease with major involvement of the lungs and heart. Acute COVID-19 pneumonia has features of a distinctive acute interstitial pneumonia with a diffuse alveolar damage component, coupled with microvascular involvement with intra- and extravascular fibrin deposition and intravascular trapping of neutrophils, and, frequently, with formation of microthombi in arterioles. Major pulmonary thromboemboli with pulmonary infarcts and/or hemorrhage occurred in 5 of the 23 patients. Two of the Houston cases had interstitial pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage pattern. One of the Houston cases had multiple bilateral segmental pulmonary thromboemboli with infarcts and hemorrhages coupled with, in nonhemorrhagic areas, a distinctive interstitial lymphocytic pneumonitis with intra-alveolar fibrin deposits and no hyaline membranes, possibly representing a transition form to acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia. Multifocal acute injury of cardiac myocytes was frequently observed. Lymphocytic myocarditis was reported in 1 case. In addition to major pulmonary pathology, the 3 Houston cases had evidence of lymphocytic pericarditis, multifocal acute injury of cardiomyocytes without inflammatory cellular infiltrates, depletion of splenic white pulp, focal hepatocellular degeneration and rare glomerular capillary thrombosis. Each had evidence of chronic cardiac disease: hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (420 g heart), dilated cardiomyopathy (1070 g heart), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (670 g heart). All 3 subjects were obese (BMIs of 33.8, 51.65, and 35.2 Kg/m2). Overall, the autopsy findings support the concept that the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 disease involves direct viral-induced injury of multiple organs, including heart and lungs, coupled with the consequences of a procoagulant state with coagulopathy.\nIntroduction\nA pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in Wuhan, China and was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office in China on 31 December 2019. The outbreak was identified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. On 11 February 2020, World Health Organization announced a name for the new coronavirus disease: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The causative virus was identified and designated as SARS-CoV-2.. Clinical reports from China have established that COVID-19 presents as an acute febrile respiratory illness as the dominant feature of a systemic disease involving multiple organ systems.\nAs the pandemic spread resulting in major morbidity and mortality, it became crystal clear to medically oriented pathologists, forensic pathologists and allied pulmonologists, cardiologists, and critical care physicians that autopsy of deceased victims of the disease was of paramount importance for gaining knowledge of its pathogenesis and pathophysiology. In a letter to the editor of Chest et al. raised a call to action, specifically for as many autopsies to be done as soon as possible to determine the pathologic substrate of this disease. This is based on the well documented importance of the autopsy in establishing the etiology, pathogenesis, and response to treatment of emerging diseases.\nHowever, pronouncements by regulatory agencies in the United States of America have led to confusion, delay and, all too often, suppression of the performance of autopsies at many institutions. Specifically, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) initially issued a contradictory statement with 1 sentence recommending suspension of postmortem procedures in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases and a second sentence indicating that, if deemed necessary and appropriate, strict adherence to basic safety procedures be used while performing such autopsies. In a subsequent statement from OSHA the first sentence was dropped. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued extensive guidelines which included rigorous standards for morgues and autopsy facilities to be under negative pressure with specific standards for venting the air from the rooms. There followed a spectrum of administrative responses to the OSHA and Centers for Disease Control directives. But the overall effect has been to create more than necessary impediments for the task before us. Of note and particular relevance for the autopsy situation, Dr. Patricia Harris, President of the American Medical Association, has issued an important statement defending science in a time of fear and uncertainty.\nFortunately for scientific inquiry, several healthcare institutions and medical examiner jurisdictions have persisted in performing autopsies on suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases. Just as a spectrum of responses has occurred for hospital autopsies, the same applies to medical examiner autopsies. Medical death investigation in the United States of America is a local function. It varies from state to state and from county to county. There are statewide, county, and regional systems that have substantial differences in their medicolegal jurisdiction. These considerations will determine the extent of COVID-19 autopsies in medical examiner jurisdictions around the country. A great service has been done by Dr. Alex Williamson of the Northwell Health System who has organized an autopsy working group and listserv for the sharing of information (awilliamson@northwell.edu).\nDespite the challenges, autopsy studies are being performed and beginning to be reported from several locations around the United States of America, including Houston, Texas. The purposes of this paper are to collate and summarize the findings from these autopsy studies, including our own 3 initial cases, to correlate them with emerging clinical information, and to provide thoughts about how this information may help with designing treatment strategies. Correlation with information emerging from China, Europe and other countries also is touched upon.\nEarly reports from China\nLiu et al. reported on an 85-year-old Chinese male who died following COVID-19 infection. The report was limited to gross autopsy findings of heavy lungs with copious amounts of gray-white viscous fluid and unremarkable heart, liver and kidneys. Xu et al. performed postmortem sampling (&quot;biopsies&quot;) of tissue from a 50-year-old man who died as a result of COVID-19 infection. Both lungs demonstrated changes consistent with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), the pathological correlate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The lungs showed interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates and atypical large pneumocytes with cytopathic changes consistent with a viral etiology. A few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were present in the heart and the liver showed moderate microvesicular steatosis.\nTian et al. reported findings on 2 patients who underwent lung lobectomies for adenocarcinoma and were retrospectively found to have had COVID-19 infection at the time of surgery. On computed tomography (CT) scan, both patients exhibited bilateral ground glass opacities in the peripheral regions of the lungs. Histopathologically, the lungs of both patients exhibited edema, proteinaceous exudate, focal hyperplasia of pneumocytes, patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration, some multinucleated giant cells, and focal intra-alveolar fibrin deposits. Since neither patient had symptoms of pneumonia at the time of surgery, Tian et al. proposed that the changes likely represent an early phase of the lung pathology of COVID-19 pneumonia.\nFindings from initial autopsy series in the United States of America (TABLES 1 and 2)\nTwo cases have been reported from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Oklahoma City, OK. The decedents were a 77-year-old obese man and a 42-year-old obese man both of whom had positive postmortem nasopharyngeal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2. The first patient had a history of hypertension, splenectomy and 6 days of fever and chills. The second patient was obese, had a history of myotonic dystrophy and developed abdominal pain followed by fever, shortness of breath and cough. Both of the deceased died outside of the hospital, and the autopsies showed evidence of emergency medical intervention, including intubation and chest compressions. Combined weight of the lungs was 2452 g for the first case and 1191 g for the second case. On histopathology, the lungs of the first case showed evidence of &quot;DAD in the acute stage characterized by numerous hyaline membranes without evidence of interstitial organization. There was very patchy and sparse interstitial chronic/lymphocytic inflammation, and chronic inflammation and edema in the bronchial mucosa. A few small thrombi were noted within a few small pulmonary artery branches.&quot; Focal acute cardiomyocyte damage labeled as ischemic injury was found. Pulmonary pathology of the second case was dominated by acute bronchopneumonia with evidence of aspiration. Neither autopsy revealed viral inclusions, mucus plugging in airways, eosinophils, or myocarditis. The first case had a 402 g heart, marked 2 vessel coronary artery disease, and microscopic evidence of acute ischemic injury. The second case had a 372 g heart with no evidence of coronary artery disease or myocardial damage. The brains were reported as showing no gross abnormalities.\nFour cases have been reported from the Department of Pathology of LSU Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA. &quot;The four decedents included male and female patients, ages 44-76. All were African American, and had histories of obesity class 2-3, and hypertension, controlled by medication. Three of the patients had insulin-dependent type II diabetes, 2 had known chronic kidney disease (stages 2 and 3) and 1 was taking methotrexate. In all cases the clinical course consisted of approximately 3 days of mild cough and fever, with sudden respiratory decompensation just prior to arrival in the emergency department. Chest radiographs revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent with ARDS which worsened over the hospital course. The patients were intubated and brought to the Intensive Care Unit. Whether the patients were placed on ventilators was not specifically stated. All of the patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by 2019 novel coronavirus real time RT-PCR. Notable laboratory findings were the development of elevated ferritin, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, and within 24 hours of death, an increased neutrophil count with relative lymphopenia. d-dimers drawn near the time of death were markedly elevated (1200-2900 ng/mL).&quot;\n&quot;All of the lungs were heavy (680-1030 g for left lungs and 800-1050 g for right lungs). The pulmonary arteries at the hilum of each of the lungs were free of thromboemboli. The parenchyma of each of the lungs was diffusely edematous and firm, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of ARDS. Notably, regions of multifocal dark-colored hemorrhage were prominent. In some cases, small, firm thrombi were present in sections of the peripheral parenchyma on gross examination. Major histological findings were bilateral DAD with multifocal hyaline membranes; a comparatively mild-to-moderate lymphocytic infiltrate, composed of a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes; and desquamated type 2-pneumocytes with apparent viral cytopathic effect consisting of cytomegaly, and enlarged nuclei with bright, eosinophilic nucleoli. The alveolar capillaries were notably thickened, with surrounding edema, and fibrin thrombi were present within capillaries and small vessels. A notable finding was the presence of CD61+ megakaryocytes, possibly representing resident pulmonary megakaryocytes, with significant nuclear hyperchromasia and atypia. These cells were found within alveolar capillaries, often in association with, and actively producing platelets. The fibrin and platelets present within small vessels also appeared to aggregate inflammatory cells, with entrapment of numerous neutrophils.&quot; With the exception of the patient on immunosuppression, no significant neutrophilic infiltrate was found within alveoli or the interstitium to suggest secondary infection.\n&quot;Examination of the heart was performed in 3 cases, with the hearts ranging in size from 430 to 550 gs (normal: 365 grams+-71). The most significant findings were cardiomegaly, and right ventricular dilatation. No case had significant coronary artery stenosis or thrombosis. Histologically, the sections of myocardium did not show any large or confluent areas of myocyte necrosis. However, there was scattered individual cell myocyte necrosis in each heart examined. Rare interstitial small collections of lymphocytes were seen. There was no significant brisk lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate consistent with the typical pattern of viral myocarditis.&quot;\n&quot;The relative distribution of dsDNA and RNA in tissue sections was examined with DRAQ5 and SYTO RNA Select fluorescent staining. Virally-infected cells in alveolar spaces showed multinucleation and grouping as evidenced by DNA stain, and abundant RNA present within the cytoplasm. Also noted was entrapment of immune cells, including degenerated neutrophils, within fibrin, and strands of extracellular material with weak DNA staining.&quot;\nHistological and ultrastructural findings have been reported from autopsies on 12 fatal COVID-19 cases from the University of Washington in conjunction with the Kings County and Snohomish Medical Examiner Offices. &quot;All 12 patients were older with significant preexisting comorbidities. The major pulmonary finding was DAD in the acute and/or organizing phases with virus identified in type I and II pneumocytes by electron microscopy. The kidney demonstrated viral particles in the tubular epithelium, endothelium, and podocytes without significant inflammation. Viral particles were also observed in the trachea and large intestines. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the cardiac tissue of a patient with lymphocytic myocarditis. RT-PCR also detected viral RNA in the subcarinal lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and large intestines.&quot;\nTwo cases have been reported from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York. &quot;The first patient, a middle-aged male with well-controlled hypertension, was admitted after 9 days with typical COVID-19 symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR amplification for both the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 a/b and pan-Sarbecovirus E-gene, but the chest radiograph showed only mild bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion. He was treated for bacterial superinfection, with some improvement, but continued to require supplemental nasal oxygen. Serum ferritin and C-reactive protein were elevated. Repeat chest radiograph on hospital day 8 revealed new dense patchy left mid-lung and retrocardiac opacities, and a hazy opacity in the right lower lung. On day 9, the patient complained of increasing left inspiratory chest pain and tenderness, and 30 minutes later developed pulseless electrical activity.&quot;\n&quot;The second patient, a middle-aged male with asthma, hypertension and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection controlled on highly-active antiretroviral therapy, was admitted with a 2-day respiratory illness history. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. He was febrile on admission, and chest radiography showed multiple bilateral lung opacities. Elevated ferritin and C-reactive protein were noted. His-condition deteriorated, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilator support. Eight days following admission he developed pulseless electrical activity.&quot;\n&quot;At autopsy, a common notable finding was pulmonary thromboembolism, with occlusion of the right main pulmonary artery in 1 case, and occlusion of both left and right pulmonary arteries in the second. Deep venous thrombosis was found in both cases. Other findings were multiple foci of pulmonary consolidation, cardiomegaly and left ventricular hypertrophy consistent with hypertensive cardiovascular disease. There was no mention of cardiomyocyte injury or myocarditis.&quot;\n&quot;Ultrastructural examination demonstrated pleomorphic viral-like particles ranging from 60 to 120 nm in distended cytoplasmic vacuoles within the pneumocytes in lung specimens from both cases. The individual spherical viral-like particles displayed distinctive projections with mature particles exhibiting electron dense centers, consistent with the appearance of coronavirus. Fibrin deposition within and outside capillaries as well as pure platelet thrombi also were noted.&quot;\nHouston cases\nHouston Case One (HC1).

Alveoli contain a mildly increased number of CD3+ T lymphocytes (A), a moderately increased number of CD68+ macrophages (B) and increased numbers of TTF+ pneumocytes (C). Clusters of pneumocytes exhibit squamous metaplasia as indicated by positive CK 5/6 expression (D). (Magnification bar: A, B, C and D; 100 microm).\nFig. 2\nCase one was a moderately obese (body mass index, BMI 33,8Kg/m2) 62-year-old Hispanic man with a few-day history of respiratory illness who was found dead in his car. A medicolegal autopsy was performed. Nasopharyngeal swab at the time of autopsy tested positive by real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 virus. Hepatitis panel (A, B, C) was negative. The hemoglobin A1C was 7.0%. The lungs were heavy (right 820 g, left 770 g), but were free of major thromboemboli and hemorrhages. Histologically, the picture was that of early DAD with multiple hyaline membranes accompanied by a focal and mild inflammation with modest numbers of CD3+ lymphocytes and more numerous CD68+ macrophages in some alveolar spaces (Fig. 1, Fig. 2 ). There also were collections of reactive pneumocytes exhibiting cytomegaly, nucleomegaly with prominent nucleoli, and mitotic figures. Some alveoli showed squamous metaplasia of the alveolar lining, presumably derived from the same reactive pneumocytes. By immunohistochemistry, the pneumocytes in the alveoli were TTF-1 and CK-7 positive and the clusters showing squamous metaplasia were P40 and CK5/6 positive. Many alveolar capillaries contained megakaryocytes identified by large, hyperchromatic nuclei. These cells were CD61+, and numerous small CD61+ particles representing platelets also were present in the capillaries. No microthrombi were identified on histological examination in small pulmonary arteries.\nHouston Case One (HC1). Electron micrographs.

The thickness of the left ventricular wall was 1.1 cm and that of the right ventricular wall was 0.2-0.3 cm. The myocardium showed cardiomyocytes with moderately enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei and individual cardiomyocytes with vacuolar degenerative change (Fig. 6 ). There was no evidence of inflammatory infiltrate indicative of myocarditis. By immunohistochemistry, there were 7-10 or less CD3+ T cells and rare CD68+ macrophages per high power field in the myocardium. Lymphocytic infiltrates composed of CD 3+T cells with were present in the epicardium with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 2:1. (Fig. 6). Random sections of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction system showed no abnormalities. The liver showed moderate macrovesicular steatosis without evidence of hepatitis (Fig. 6). The kidneys showed evidence of hyaline arteriolosclerosis with glomerulosclerosis. Viral particles were identified in some glomerular endothelial cells. The spleen was enlarged. There was expansion of the red pulp by congestion but also by a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (Fig. 7 ). The white pulp was diminished and shrunken with absence of marginal zones. There were scattered immunoblasts near the edge of the small white pulp and scattered into the red pulp. There were no microthrombi or morphological features of vasculitis or a microangiopathic process. There were no macrophages with features of hemophagocytosis, thus no evidence for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The brain was not examined.\nHouston Case Two (HC2). (A and B) Axial CT images which demonstrate bilateral upper and lower lobe ground-glass and early consolidative alveolar opacities some of rounded morphology, classically described with COVID-19.\nFig. 8\nCase Two was a 34-year-old obese (BMI 51.65 Kg/m2) African-American man with a past medical history of hypertension, heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (&lt;20%), type II diabetes mellitus and microcytic anemia who presented to the emergency room after developing headache, shortness of breath, cough productive of bloody sputum for 4 days, and fever for 1 day. On admission, chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly and diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities in the lungs. The CT chest findings included diffuse ground glass opacities of rounded morphology involving the upper and lower lobes of both lungs (Fig. 8 ). The pulmonary artery was dilated at 3.4 cm (normal less than 3.15 cm) indicative of pulmonary hypertension. A pulmonary embolism was not identified. There was global cardiomegaly and a trace pericardial effusion. Electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy with left axis deviation. The patient's laboratory findings included white blood cell count of 4.0/microL with 81.5% neutrophils (absolute 3.28), lymphocytes 12.4% (absolute 0.50), monocytes 5.2% (absolute 0.50) eosinophils 0.2%, and basophils 0.5%, platelets 190/microL, hemoglobin (Hg) 11.2 g%, mean corpuscular volume 70.8, and red cell distribution 36. and mildly elevated serum troponin with a peak of 0.22 ng/mL (normal &lt; 0.045 ng/mL). Hemoglobin A1c was 6.3%. On admission brain naturetic peptide was 428 pg/mL and troponin was 0.09 ng/mL (normal &lt;0.045 ng/mL). Troponin later peaked at 0.22 ng/mL. Ferritin, d-dimer, prothrombin time, and partial thomboplastin time were not measured. Creatinine on admission was 1.0 mg/dL (normal 0.7-1.3 mg/dL) and remained normal until a final reading of 2.4 mg/dL.\nThe patient was initially treated with antibiotics which was deescalated to supportive case when the nasopharyngeal swab test (RT-PCR) came back positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus. Tests for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. Working diagnoses in addition to COVID-19 infection were non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NYHA class 3) with acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure. The patient had a 10-day hospital course marked by recurrent fever, episodes of hemoptysis and shortness of breath. He received supplemental oxygen at 3-5 liters per minute but he was never placed on a mechanical ventilator. On the day of his death, he experienced severe worsening of respiratory failure followed by pulseless electrical activity.\nHouston Case Two (HC2). (A) Pulmonary thromboembolus obstructing segmental pulmonary artery; one of several in both lungs. (B) Terminal bronchiole with interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates. (C) Interstitial and intra-alveolar infiltrates composed predominantly of lymphocytes. (D) Intra-alveolar fibrin deposit (star). The pulmonary arteriole has a thickened wall indicative of chronic pulmonary hypertension. (A, B, C, D; Hematoxylin and eosin stains). (Magnification bar: A, 500 microm; B, 100 microm; C and D, 50 microm).\nFig. 9\nHouston Case Two (HC2). (A and B) Myocardium is edematous and small blood vessels are congested. The CMC exhibit multifocal vacuolar degenerative changes. No inflammatory cellular infiltrates are present. Note the increased width of these CMC compared to those of HCO (Fig. 6B).

(A and B, one-micron sections, toluidine blue stain; C and D, hematoxylin and eosin stains). (Magnification bar: A and B, 20 microm; C, 100 microm; D 500 microm).\nFig. 10\nAt autopsy, the major gross findings were extremely congested lungs (1980 g combined weight) with multiple bilateral segmental pulmonary thromboemboli and multiple areas of hemorrhage, confirmed histologically as acute, unorganized thrombi (Fig. 9 ). The heart that weighed 1070 g with four-chamber hypertrophy and dilatation and patent coronary arteries with minimal atherosclerosis. The thickness of the left ventricular wall was 1.5-1.6 cm and that of the right ventricular wall was 0.5 cm. The brain was not examined. Histologically the myocardium showed epicardial lymphocytic infiltrates; cardiomyocyte hypertrophy; multifocal interstitial and replacement fibrosis; scattered damaged individual cardiomyocytes, and no inflammatory foci indicative of myocarditis (Fig. 10 ). By immunohistochemistry, there were 7-10 or less CD3+ T cells and rare CD68+ macrophages per high power field in the myocardium. Lymphocytic infiltrates composed of CD 3+T cells with were present in the epicardium with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 2:1. Random sections of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction system showed no abnormalities. The lungs showed multiple bilateral segmental acute thromboemboli with associated areas of pulmonary hemorrhage and infarction (Fig. 9). Away from these areas, the lungs showed evidence of an interstitial lymphocytic pneumonitis with lymphocytic infiltrates around small blood vessels and in the walls of terminal bronchioles extending into alveolar septae (Fig. 9). Microthrombi were found in some pulmonary arterioles. The alveoli contained multiple deposits of fibrin without well-formed hyaline membranes and clusters of pneumocytes. By immunohistochemistry, the pneumocytes in the alveoli were TTF-1 and CK-7 positive and the clusters showing squamous metaplasia were P40 and CK5/6 positive. No microthrombi were identified. The heart showed evidence of individual damaged cardiomyocytes. No inflammatory infiltrates were present. The liver showed moderate macrosteatosis without inflammatory infiltrates. The spleen showed features similar to the spleen of Case 1 with generalized reduction in amount of white pulp and no evidence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis . The kidneys showed an occasional fibrin-platelet thrombus in renal glomerular capillaries. The testis exhibited thrombi in peritesticular veins (Fig. 10). The brain was not examined.\nCase Three was a 48-year-old obese (BMI 35.2 Kg/m2) Hispanic man who was found dead at his residence. A medicolegal autopsy was performed. Nasopharyngeal swab at the time of autopsy tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 virus. Screen for influenza viruses was negative. On opening the body, purulent tan opaque watery fluid measuring 500 mL was found in the right pleural cavity. Yellow translucent deposits were focally present of the visceral pleura along the upper/middle interlobar fissure. Organized tan to greenish exudate with fibrotic thickening was present along the parietal and visceral pleural surfaces of the lower lobe. These were features of an empyema. The right lung was collapsed. Minimal fluid was found in the left pleural cavity, pericardial sac and peritoneal cavity. Bacterial cultures of the right pleural cavity and lung grew mixed flora consistent with postmortem contamination. The right and left lungs weighed 1020 and 960 g, respectively. The treacheobronchial tree was lined by a hyperemic red-brown mucosa with no mucous plugs. The major pulmonary arteries were free of thromboemboli. The parenchyma of the lungs was dull red-brown and firm. The heart weighed 670 g. The coronary arteries showed minimal atherosclerosis and were widely patent. Both ventricles were dilated. The thickness of the left ventricular free wall and interventricular septum was 1.6 cm and that of the right ventricle was 0.3 cm.\nHouston Case Three (HC3). (A) Pulmonary parenchyma showing interstitial pneumonia with DAD pattern. (B) Bronchiole with fibrinous exudate. (C) Alveolar capillaries contain numerous megakaryocytes with large hyperchromatic nuclei. (D) Alveoli contain enlarged reactive pneumocytes and fibrin deposit. (A, B, C, and D; Hematoxylin and eosin stains). (Magnification bar: A, 200 microm; B, 100 microm; C and D, 20 microm).\nFig. 11\nOn histological examination, the right pleura exhibited a necroinflammatory infiltrate overlying cellular granulation tissue confirming the diagnosis of empyema. The right lung showed evidence of atelectasis as well as evidence of DAD. The DAD was more pronounced in the expanded left lung. The changes consisted of multifocal hyaline membranes, intra-alveolar fibrinous exudate, abundant intra-capillary megakaryocytes, numerous intra-alveolar macrophages, and activated type II pneumocytes, along with some neutrophils and intra-alveolar hemorrhage (Fig. 11 ).\nMultifocal lymphocytic infiltrates were present in the epicardium. CMC showed enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei. Individual CMC showed changes of acute injury. No inflammatory cellular infiltrates were found. Additionally, there were prominent foci of CMC disarray, particularly involving the superior portion of the interventricular septum. Many of the intramural coronary arteries showed intimal and medical thickening with luminal narrowing. The myofiber disarray and intramural coronary vasculopathy are diagnostic features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Random sections of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction system showed no abnormalities.\nThe liver showed moderate macrovesicular steatosis, lymphoplasmacytic triaditis with portal fibrosis and early portal-portal bridging fibrosis. The kidneys showed mild hyaline arteriolosclerosis and periglomerular hyaline arteriolosclerosis with rare holosclerotic glomeruli. The spleen showed lymphocyte depletion in the white pulp with absence of marginal zones; the red pulp was expanded with congestion and hemorrhage; abundant plasma cells were present in the red pulp. The brain showed no significant histopathological change.\nDiscussion\nGeneral\nCOVID-19 is a viral disease that involves multiple organ systems while usually presenting as an acute febrile respiratory illness. Acute COVID-19 has 3 distinct phases: early infection, pulmonary and severe hyperinflammation. Prognostic indicators of a more serious and potentially fatal course include older age, lymphopenia, elevated d-dimer level, elevated troponin levels and pre-existing cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

From these initially reported cases, a spectrum of pathology of COVID-19 disease is emerging. The picture will be enhanced as more cases are studied and reported.\nBased on clinicopathological correlation from these first 23 autopsy cases, the following observations are made: (1) acute COVID-19 pneumonia, not complicated by prolonged hospitalization and ventilator therapy, is a viral interstitial pneumonia characterized by the early exudative phase of DAD with endothelial and epithelial injury, hyaline membranes, reactive pneumocytes with viral cytopathic effect, and mild combined lymphocytic and histiocytic intra-alveolar inflammation; 2) a different pulmonary pathology pattern that can be associated wtih an illness of several days is that of a lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis with intra-alveolar fibrin deposits, which may represent an early stage of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP); (3) the picture of early COVID-19 pulmonary disease is remarkably similar to the DAD described with SARS-CoV virus infection in which both acute interstitial pneumonitis with a DAD pattern and AFOP have been described; (4) although not universally found, pulmonary microthrombi are common, consistent with the frequent development of a SARS-CoV-2- induced hypercoagulable state; (5) major pulmonary thromboembolism is a common fatal complication; (6) cardiovascular disease is a frequent co-morbidity in fatal cases; (7) individual cardiomyocyte damage is frequent, probably as a result of infection of endothelial cells, perivascular cells and/or cardiomyocytes (see below); (8) myocarditis is much less common than suggested by elevated serum troponin levels, particularly if high sensitivity troponin is used; (9) depletion of white pulp of the spleen occurs as a correlate of the lymphopenia; (10) frequency and severity of target organ involvement in this systemic disease is linked to the distribution of the ACE-2 receptor for the virus; (11) the frequent co-infection with influenza and other viruses makes for difficulties in determining the direct effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; (12) antibody-dependent enhancement may be important in determining the variable response to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection; (13) treatment strategies should be guided by insights into the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disease provided by autopsy studies.\nPulmonary system\nHigh confidence imaging findings on CT in patients with COVID-19 in the early phase include peripheral and bilateral ground glass opacities sometimes demonstrating a rounded morphology. This pattern of imaging is classically seen with evolving pneumonia explaining the causative pattern of lung injury. With disease progression, more areas of consolidation are seen that can progress to diffuse multifocal airspace disease as seen with DAD and ARDS. Imaging patterns that suggest an alternative diagnosis include a lobar pattern of consolidation, discrete pulmonary micronodules, pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy. Although the bilateral peripheral distribution of opacities is considered to be characteristic of COVID-19, other viral pneumonias, including those produced by certain strains of influenza, also can have a bilateral distribution of radiographic findings.\nFrom the analysis of autopsy findings in fatal COVID-19 cases, the pathological correlate of the imaging findings seen early in the course of COVID-19 is the distinctive interstitial pneumonia with DAD pattern. This COVID-19 interstitial pneumonitis can be accompanied by small vessel thrombi with associated hemorrhage in the lung periphery. The COVID-19 interstitial pneumonitis also may be complicated and masked by multiple pulmonary thomboemboli (Houston Case Two and the 2 Mt. Sinai cases).\nThe pathogenesis of COVID-19 pulmonary disease involves binding of SARS-CoV-2 virus to ACE-2 receptors to pneumocytes and endothelial cells leading to development of acute lung injury manifest as DAD. The inflammatory reaction in DAD involves endothelial cell damage, capillary leak, activation of type II pneumocytes, and involvement of polarized pulmonary macrophages. There is also evidence for a role for pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy in COVID-19 pulmonary disease. The pathophysiology of disease progression likely involves hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.\nAlso, the possible relationships and merging of the patterns of DAD and organizing pneumonia, also known as bronchiolitis obliterans combined organizing pneumonia and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, as well as a variant know as AFOP, need further study. The dominant feature of AFOP is intra-alveolar fibrin &quot;balls&quot; or aggregates, typically in a patchy distribution. Organizing pneumonia in the form of luminal loose fibroblastic tissue is present surrounding the fibrin. Hyaline membranes are absent. The acute interstitial pneumonia of Hamman-Rich syndrome is characterized by the simultaneous presence of both acute and organizing DAD.\nCopin et al. recently have reported the findings from postmortem biopsies in 6 patients. The 1 patient who died after a 5-day course showed a lymphocytic viral pneumonia with DAD pattern. The 5 other patients who died after about 20 days of symptoms had the histological pattern of AFOP. Correlation with pathophysiological showed that the first patient had a type L pattern of low pulmonary elastance whereas the other 5 patients had a type H pattern of high pulmonary elastance. Our patient who died after a 10-14-day course had a lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis with intra-alveolar fibrin deposits and no hyaline membranes or foci of organizing pneumonia. This pattern may represent a transition from the DAD to the AFOP patterns. Interstitial pneumonitis with DAD and AFOP patterns has been described in the original SARS disease. Going forward, more extensive and detailed correlation of the clinical, imaging and pathological changes of the pulmonary component of COVID-19 is needed.\nCardiovascular system\nThe cardiovascular system is majorly impacted in many patients with COVID-19 disease. Clinical features are indicative of acute myocardial injury as manifested by elevated serum troponin level, arrhythmias and ST segment elevation and/or depression on electrocardiogram in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.\nTavazzi et al. obtained an endomyocardial biopsy from a 69-year-old patent with a flu-like illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection that was successfully treated with venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and mechanical ventilation. Endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated low-grade myocardial inflammation and viral particles in the myocardial interstitial cells but not in cardiomyocytes or endothelial cells. The ultrastructural study demonstrated single or small groups of viral particles with the morphology (dense round viral envelope and electron-dense spike-like structures on their surface) and size (variable between 70 and 120 nm) of coronaviruses. The authors interpreted the findings as evidence of direct involvement of the myocardium during a viremic phase or migration of infected macrophages from the lung. Grimes et al. demonstrated 60-120 nm &quot;viral-like&quot; particles in distended cytoplasmic vacuoles within pneumocytes as well as rupture of the cytoplasmic vacuoles with release of the virus-like particles into the alveolar lumen. The individual spherical viral-like particles had distinctive projections with mature particles exhibiting electron dense centers, consistent with the appearance of coronaviruses.\nMild to moderate troponin elevations, particularly if measured by the high sensitivity troponin assays (hs-Tn), must be interpreted with caution regarding the magnitude of myocardial injury and may not reflect extensive irreversible myocardial injury due to myocardial ischemia or myocardial inflammation. Overt myocarditis, characterized by inflammatory cellular infiltrates with associated cardiomyocyte damage, does occur with COVID-19 infection but is much less common than suggested by overinterpretation of troponin levels. Right heart strain with pulmonary thromboembolism also can be associated with elevated troponin level.\nChen et al. hypothesized that pericytes may be infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and cause capillary endothelial cell and microvascular dysfunction that may cause individual cardiomyocte necrosis. This can explain the frequent occurrence of mild to moderate troponin elevations in patients with COVID-19. Direct involvement of coronary arteries in viral infections has been considered in the pathogenesis of clinical cardiac manifestations of these diseases. However, inflammation of the coronary arteries has not been observed in the Houston COVID-19 autopsy cases. Another manifestation of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 may be stress induced, i.e., Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.\nPre-existing heart disease, diabetes mellitus and obesity clearly predispose to adverse outcome from COVID-19 infection. Of note, the 3 Houston cases were obese men with evidence of chronic heart disease: hypertension-related left ventricular hypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The nature of the interactions requires further study. Another phenomenon is that the COVID-19 pandemic is causing patients with acute coronary syndromes to delay obtaining treatment or avoid presenting to the hospital for medical attention, with potentially fatal consequences. Patients with cardiac transplants may be at particularly increased risk.\nInfluenza infection imparts an increased risk for acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death in subsequent months following the acute illness. It is important to determine if COVID-19 infection imparts a similar risk for subsequent cardiovascular events.\nSystemic manifestations of COVID-19\nCOVID-19 infection of organs is initiated by binding of the virus to the ACE-2 receptor on a cell. Thus, the distribution of the ACE-2 receptor in various cell types in different organs determines the involvement of these sites in the progression of COVID-19. The diseases progresses from a pulmonary infection to a systemic disease. In addition to heart and lung, target organ involvement of brain stem, liver and kidneys have been reported. In this report, involvement of the spleen is documented. Even though histological changes in the kidney are relatively mild, many COVID-19 patients are experiencing clinical features of acute renal injury and failure.\nClinical reports have associated severe pneumonia and fatal outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 with elevated levels of d-dimer and fibrin degradation products, suggesting derangement of coagulation activation and consequently a potential disposition to thromboembolic events.. Grimes et al. point out that several viral infections have been associated with coagulation disorders that may lead to thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Both influenza virus and SARS have been associated with pulmonary intravascular thrombi formation and fibrin deposition likely as a result of DIC and microthrombosis. In SARS coronavirus infection, increased production of a novel pro-coagulant by infected cells due to increased hfg12 gene transcription induced by viral nucleocapsid (N) protein has been proposed as a mechanism contributing to thrombosis.\nFox et al. noted pulmonary microvascular thrombi, CD4+ T cells around the thrombosed vessels, focal hemorrhages, abundant megakaryocytes in pulmonary capillaries, platelet aggregation, platelet-rich clots, associated entrapment of neutrophils, and fibrin deposits inside and outside of capillaries. We also observed entrapment of neutrophils in capillaries and fibrin deposits within and outside of capillaries. We concur with the suggestion of Fox et al. that an important pathogenic mechanism of fatal COVID-19 disease is a thrombotic microangiopathy primarily involving the lungs. Variation in the demonstration of microthombi in the lungs may relate to the stage of the coagulopathy at the time of death. In DIC, microthrombi are found in multiple organs in relationship to the peak of clot formation but may not be found when the DIC has progressed to depletion of clotting factors and activation of fibrinolysis.\n(A) Immunohistochemistry for CD61 (Glycoprotein IIIa) shows numerous megakaryocytes and platelets (small punctate bodies) in alveolar capillaries.

(B) Electron micrograph shows a collection of viral particles in a vacuole inside a renal glomerular endothelial cell from Houston Case One (HC1). X50,000. (C) Electron micrograph of a single 100 nanometer viral particle free in the cytoplasm of a renal glomerular endothelial cell from HC1. Note the nucleocapsid and membrane spike proteins. X50,000.\nFig. 12\nEndothelial cell infection has been noted in at least two studies. Virus-induced endotheliitis appears to be an important underlying mechanism causing vascular dysfunction and thrombotic events in lung, kidney, brain, and possibly the heart and other organs (Fig. 12 ). Also, the influence of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses likely is important in influencing the outcome in individual patients. This phenomenon may be involved in the recently reported development of a clinical picture with features of atypical Kawasaki disease in some children with COVID-19 termed pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome.\nConclusions\nAutopsy studies have established that COVID-19 is a systemic disease with major involvement of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems and with the expected accompaniment of major activation of the inflammatory and immune systems. The autopsy studies also provide evidence that SARS-COV-2 patients have a baseline hypercoagulable state and are at increased risk for pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy as well as the development of deep vein thromboses and major pulmonary thromboembolism. The autopsy findings support evaluation and management for coagulopathy early in the course of disease and judicious use of prophylactic anticoagulants while hospitalized.\nThe initial approach to acute therapy for COVID-19 patients with life-threatening respiratory failure has involved administration of supplemental oxygen, artificial ventilation and use of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenator when necessary. Additional approaches and strategies for treatment of COVID-19 patients are actively being pursued, and they are clearly needed. Autopsies on COVID-19 patients need to continue to be performed to further elucidate the natural history of the disease and to guide the development of optimal therapeutic regimens. A recent report of 21 autopises of COVID-19 patients from Basel, Switzerland provides further confirmation of the findings in the present study.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nNone.\nReferences\nWuhan Municipal Health Commission.

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Institut Pasteur.

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.101.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls.\n\n We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L) or lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L).\n\n\nFindings\nNormal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L), lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L), eosinopenia (&lt;0·02 109/L), and elevated hs-CRP (?4 mg/L) were presented in 95·0%, 52·2%, 74·7% and 86·7% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87·2%, 28·8%, 31·3% and 45·2% of the controls, respectively.\n\n The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74·7% and specificity of 68·7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0·717.

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·031·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·6112·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·024·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel CoronavirusInfected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) as well the treatment measures were collected and analysed.\n\n\nResults\nWe found that COVID?19 patients without other comorbidities but with diabetes (n = 24) were at higher risk of severe pneumonia, release of tissue injury?related enzymes, excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism.\n\n Furthermore, serum levels of inflammation?related biomarkers such as IL?6, C?reactive protein, serum ferritin and coagulation index, D?dimer, were significantly higher (P &lt;?.\n\n01) in diabetic patients compared with those without, suggesting that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to an inflammatory storm eventually leading to rapid deterioration of COVID?19.\nConclusions\nOur data support the notion that diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of

The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures.\n\n 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]).\n\n Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]).\n\n Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38·5°C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37·538·5°C.\n\n Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]).\n\n Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB.\n\n All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavirritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation.\n\n Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days.\n\n By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAlthough all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.\n\n\nFunding\nNingbo Clinical Research Center for Children's Health and Diseases, Ningbo Reproductive Medicine Centre, and Key Scientific and Technological Innovation

and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients","abstract":"Background:\nA patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta.\n\n The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear.\n\n This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively.\n\n The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed.\n\n Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs.\n\n The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.\n\n\nResults:\nIn the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study.\n\n In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.062.0) years were analyzed.\n\n After in-hospital treatment, patients inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition.\n\n The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.011.0) days.\n\n By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.016.0) days after symptom onset.\n\n Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.04.0) days.\n\n Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients urine specimens after throat swabs were negative.\n\n Using a multiple linear regression model (F?=?2.669, P?=?0.044, and adjusted R2?=?0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients stools (t?=??2.699, P?=?0.010).\n\n The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs.\n\n 8.0 days, respectively; t?=?2.550, P?=?0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs.\n\n 11 days, respectively; t?=?4.631, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P?&gt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions:\nIn brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence.\n\n Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease.\n\n The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wolters

other reasons.\n SARS-CoV was detected in all 22 postmortem lung tissues (to 109 viral copies/g) from 11 patients with probable SARS but was not detected in any of the 23 lung control samples (sample analysis was blinded).\n The sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) were 100% (84.6% to 100%) and 100% (85.1% to 100%), respectively.\n Viral loads were significantly associated with a shorter course of illness but not with the use of ribavirin or steroids.\n CoV was consistently identified in the lungs of all patients who died of SARS but not in control patients, supporting a primary role for CoV in deaths.\n","id":"PMC3322746","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Centers for Disease Control and

new human infectious disease with significant morbidity and mortality.\n The disease has been shown to be associated with a new coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n The clinical and epidemiological aspects of SARS have been described.\n Moreover, the viral genome of SARS?CoV has been fully sequenced.\n However, much of the biological behaviour of the virus is not known and data on the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS?CoV are limited.\n In this study, six fatal cases of SARS were investigated for the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS?CoV using an in?situ hybridization (ISH) technique.\n Among all the tissues studied, positive signals were seen in pneumocytes in the lungs and surface enterocytes in the small bowel.\n Infected pneumocytes were further confirmed by immunofluorescencefluorescence in?situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.\n These results provide important information concerning the tissue tropism of SARS?CoV, which is distinct from previously identified human coronaviruses, and suggest the possible involvement of novel receptors in this infection.\n Whereas the lung pathology was dominated by diffuse alveolar damage, the gut was relatively intact.\n These findings indicated that tissue responses to SARS?CoV infection are distinct in different organs.\n Copyright © 2004 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.\n","id":"PMC7167900","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John

Pathogenesis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious viral disease characterized by severe clinical manifestations of the lower respiratory tract.\n The pathogenesis of SARS is highly complex, with multiple factors leading to severe injury in the lungs and dissemination of the virus to several other organs.\n The SARS coronavirus targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage.\n Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury.\n Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease.\n In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms.\n The latter include dysregulation of cytokines/chemokines, deficiencies in the innate immune response, direct infection of immune cells, direct viral cytopathic effects, down-regulation of lung protective angiotensin converting enzyme 2, autoimmunity, and genetic factors.\n It seems that both abnormal immune responses and injury to immune cells may be key factors in the pathogenesis of this new disease.\n","id":"PMC1829448","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Investigative

For smaller samples our new formula, devised in this paper, should be used.\n\n We also estimated the variance of an unknown sample using the median, low and high end of the range, and the sample size.\n\n Our estimate is performing as the best estimate in our simulations for very small samples (n ? 15).\n\n For moderately sized samples (15 &lt;n ? 70), our simulations show that the formula range/4 is the best estimator for the standard deviation (variance).\n\n For large samples (n &gt; 70), the formula range/6 gives the best estimator for the standard deviation (variance).\n\n\nConclusion\nUsing these formulas, we hope to help meta-analysts use clinical trials in their analysis even when not all of the information is available and/or

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths.\n ADE also requires prior exposure to similar

When typical or indeterminate features of COVID-19 pneumonia are present in endemic areas as an incidental finding, we recommend contacting the referring providers to discuss the likelihood of viral infection.\n These incidental findings do not necessarily need to be reported as COVID-19 pneumonia.\n In this setting, using the term viral pneumonia can be a reasonable and inclusive alternative.\n However, if one opts to use the term COVID-19 in the incidental setting, consider the provided standardized reporting language.\n In addition, practice patterns may vary, and this document is meant to serve as a guide.\n Consultation with clinical colleagues at each institution is suggested to establish a consensus reporting approach.\n The goal of this expert consensus is to help radiologists recognize findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and aid their communication with other healthcare providers, assisting management of patients during this

published literature on radiologic features of COVID-19 infection was conducted.\n\n\nResults\nThe predominant imaging pattern was of ground-glass opacification with occasional consolidation in the peripheries.\n\n Pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy were absent in all cases.\n\n Patients demonstrated evolution of the ground-glass opacities into consolidation and subsequent resolution of the airspace changes.\n\n Ground-glass and consolidative opacities visible on CT are sometimes undetectable on chest radiography, suggesting that CT is a more sensitive imaging modality for investigation.\n\n The systematic review identified four other studies confirming the findings of bilateral and peripheral ground glass with or without consolidation as the predominant finding at CT chest examinations.\n\n\nConclusion\nPulmonary manifestation of COVID-19 infection is predominantly characterized by ground-glass opacification with occasional consolidation on CT.\n\n Radiographic findings in patients presenting in Shenzhen and Hong Kong are in keeping with four previous publications from other sites.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233595","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Radiological Society of North

beginning of 2020, our study team formulated a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription named Sanhanhuashi formula (SHHS) to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\n Then we conducted several studies to explore the effectiveness of SHHS formula and other influencing factors on prognosis of disease.\n\n The purpose of this study was to describe the trends of patients characters from 2020 to 2021 based on two separate cohorts, and to explore the influencing factors on incidence of severe COVID-19 conditions, especially the contributions of timely treatment and higher compliance to SHHS formula.\n\n\nMethods\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted in Wuhan, Hubei province and Tonghua, Jilin province.\n\n Participants were hospitalized mild to moderate COVID-19 consecutive enrolled patients in Wuhan hospital of traditional Chinese and western medicine (from Feb 13, 2020 to March 8, 2020) and Tonghua central hospital (from Jan 17, 2021 to Feb 5, 2021).\n\n Age, sex, time waiting to be hospitalized, medical history, initial symptoms, concomitant medication, and severity of disease were collected.\n\n Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to explore the associations between various exposures and the outcome, ie.\n\n the proportion of patients who were converted to severe status.\n\n E-values and its lower control limit (LCL) were calculated for sensitivity analysis.\n\n\nResults\nTotally, 176 COVID-19 patients in two hospitals were enrolled.\n\n 81 patients were from Wuhan hospital of traditional Chinese and western medicine and 95 from Tonghua central hospital.\n\n 42 patients used SHHS formula arrival or exceed 7 days, and 2 (4.8%) progressed to severe condition.\n\n Among 134 patients who were exposed SHHS less than 7 days, 18 (13.4%) were converted to severe situation.\n\n Compared with those diagnosed in 2020, cases in 2021 were characterized as lower rates of initial symptoms (88.9% vs 35.8%, P &lt; 0.001) and concomitant medications ever widely used, eg.\n\n antiviral medicine (71.6% vs 43.2%, P &lt; 0.001), antibiotics (61.7% vs 13.7%, P &lt; 0.001) and Chinese patent medicine (76.5% vs 44.2%, P &lt; 0.001).\n\n They also waited less time for hospitalization (median: 12 vs 2 days, P &lt; 0.001).\n\n The final multivariate logistic regression model showed that age (&gt; 60 yrs) (OR: 3.943; 95% CI: 1.40211.086; P = 0.009; E-value = 7.35, LCL:2.15), diagnosis year (OR: 0.165; 95% CI: 0.0500.551; P = 0.003; E-value=11.6, LCL: 3.03) and SHHS exposure (OR: 0.118; 95% CI: 0.0140.992; P = 0.049; E-value = 16.43, LCL:1.1) were independent risk factors for predicting severe status.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe profile of COVID-19 patients has changed after one year.\n\n In addition to age, diagnosis year and SHHS exposure are two new factors to predict the prognosis of disease.\n\n The patients diagnosed in 2021 were mainly benefited from timely treatment.\n\n Subsequently, adhere to use SHHS formula a quite longer time reduced the number of severe cases.\n\n Therefore, both the current epidemic prevention and control measures and increasing compliance to traditional Chinese

Coronavirus and Aberrant Induction of Inflammatory Cytokines and Chemokines in Human Macrophages: Implications for Pathogenesis","abstract":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection caused severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction and had a higher crude fatality rate (around 50% vs 10%) than SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection.\n To understand the pathogenesis, we studied viral replication, cytokine/chemokine response, and antigen presentation in MERS-CoVinfected human monocytederived macrophages (MDMs) versus SARS-CoVinfected MDMs.\n Only MERS-CoV can replicate in MDMs.\n Both viruses were unable to significantly stimulate the expression of antiviral cytokines (interferon ? [IFN-?] and IFN-?) but induced comparable levels of tumor necrosis factor ? and interleukin 6. Notably, MERS-CoV induced significantly higher expression levels of interleukin 12, IFN-?, and chemokines (IP-10/CXCL-10, MCP-1/CCL-2, MIP-1?/CCL-3, RANTES/CCL-5, and interleukin 8) than SARS-CoV.\n The expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and costimulatory molecules were significantly higher in MERS-CoVinfected MDMs than in SARS-CoVinfected cells.\n MERS-CoV replication was validated by immunostaining of infected MDMs and ex vivo lung tissue.\n We conclusively showed that MERS-CoV can establish a productive infection in human macrophages.\n The aberrant induction of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines could be important in the disease pathogenesis.\n","id":"PMC7107356","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

analysis of chikungunya virus infection and identification of granzyme A as a major promoter of arthritic inflammation","abstract":"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus causing epidemics of acute and chronic arthritic disease.\n Herein we describe a comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis of feet and lymph nodes at peak viraemia (day 2 post infection), acute arthritis (day 7) and chronic disease (day 30) in the CHIKV adult wild-type mouse model.\n Genes previously shown to be up-regulated in CHIKV patients were also up-regulated in the mouse model.\n CHIKV sequence information was also obtained with up to ?8% of the reads mapping to the viral genome; however, no adaptive viral genome changes were apparent.\n Although day 2, 7 and 30 represent distinct stages of infection and disease, there was a pronounced overlap in up-regulated host genes and pathways.\n Type I interferon response genes (IRGs) represented up to ?50% of up-regulated genes, even after loss of type I interferon induction on days 7 and 30. Bioinformatic analyses suggested a number of interferon response factors were primarily responsible for maintaining type I IRG induction.\n A group of genes prominent in the RNA-Seq analysis and hitherto unexplored in viral arthropathies were granzymes A, B and K.\n Granzyme A-/- and to a lesser extent granzyme K-/-, but not granzyme B-/-, mice showed a pronounced reduction in foot swelling and arthritis, with analysis of granzyme A-/- mice showing no reductions in viral loads but reduced NK and T cell infiltrates post CHIKV infection.\n Treatment with Serpinb6b, a granzyme A inhibitor, also reduced arthritic inflammation in wild-type mice.\n In non-human primates circulating granzyme A levels were elevated after CHIKV infection, with the increase correlating with viral load.\n Elevated granzyme A levels were also seen in a small cohort of human CHIKV patients.\n Taken together these results suggest granzyme A is an important driver of arthritic inflammation and a potential target for therapy.\n","id":"PMC5312928","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Jane A.

base for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data.\n It is an integrated database consisting of three generic categories of systems information, genomic information and chemical information, and an additional human-specific category of health information.\n KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules have been developed as generic molecular networks with KEGG Orthology nodes of functional orthologs so that KEGG pathway mapping and other procedures can be applied to any cellular organism.\n Unfortunately, however, this generic approach was inadequate for knowledge representation in the health information category, where variations of human genomes, especially disease-related variations, had to be considered.\n Thus, we have introduced a new approach where human gene variants are explicitly incorporated into what we call network variants in the recently released KEGG NETWORK database.\n This allows accumulation of knowledge about disease-related perturbed molecular networks caused not only by gene variants, but also by viruses and other pathogens, environmental factors and drugs.\n We expect that KEGG NETWORK will become another reference knowledge base for the basic understanding of disease mechanisms and practical use in clinical sequencing and drug

Mouse-Adapted SARS-CoV","abstract":"A novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, emerged suddenly in 2003, causing approximately 8000 human cases and more than 700 deaths worldwide.\n Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear.\n Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice.\n In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection.\n Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88?/?), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection.\n The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection.\n MyD88?/? mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection.\n Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88?/? mice compared to wild-type mice.\n Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88?/?mice.\n These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung are required for protection from lethal rMA15 infection.\n","id":"PMC2587915","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

over 8000 individuals and mortality in 744 in 29 countries.\n Lymphopenia along with neutrophilia was a feature of SARS, as it is in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Ebola infections, to name a few.\n Direct infestation of lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages by SARS coronavirus (CoV) has been debated as a cause of lymphopenia, but there is no convincing data.\n Lymphopenia can be caused by glucocorticoids, and thus any debilitating condition has the potential to induce lymphopenia via stress mechanism involving the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis.\n Cortisol levels are elevated in patients with RSV and Ebola, and cortisol was higher in SARS patients with lymphopenia before any steroid therapy.\n Glucocorticoids also down-regulate the production of proinflammatory lymphokines.\n Because of the insidious presentation, SARS was treated with antibacterial, antiviral and supra-physiological doses of glucocorticoids.\n Treatment with glucocorticoids complicated the issue regarding lymphopenia, and certainly calls into question the status of lymphokines and their prognostic implications in

patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nIn response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients.\n\n We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria.\n\n In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria.\n\n Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture.\n\n In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm.\n\n Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive.\n\n In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm.\n\n\nConclusions\nDespite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak.\n\n Some may have been harmful.\n\n Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and to accrue data in real time during future outbreaks to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1564166","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Lauren J","surname":"Stockman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Bellamy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Garner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Donald","surname":"Low","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Donald","surname":"Low","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/nri1835-c1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Glucocorticoid treatment of patients with SARS: implications for mechanisms of immunopathology","abstract":"","id":"PMC7097456","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Nirmal S.","surname":"Panesar","email":"nspanesar@cuhk.edu.hk","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30317-2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical evidence does not support corticosteroid treatment for 2019-nCoV lung injury","abstract":"","id":"PMC7134694","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Clark D","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan E","surname":"Millar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J Kenneth","surname":"Baillie","email":"j.k.baillie@ed.ac.uk","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1097/ALN.0000000000000569","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction: physiology and anesthetic implications","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.013","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cardiovascular disease and COVID-19","abstract":"Background and aims\nMany patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have underlying cardiovascular (CV) disease or develop acute cardiac injury during the course of the illness.\n\n Adequate understanding of the interplay between COVID-19 and CV disease is required for optimum management of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nA literature search was done using PubMed and Google search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic.\n\n\nResults\nRespiratory illness is the dominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19; CV involvement occurs much less commonly.\n\n Acute cardiac injury, defined as significant elevation of cardiac troponins, is the most commonly reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19.

outcomes from COVID-19, but these studies have not provided insight into potential reasons for this.\n\n We hypothesised that outcomes would be poorer for those of South Asian ethnicity hospitalised from a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, once confounding factors, health-seeking behaviours and community demographics were considered, and that this might reflect a more aggressive disease course in these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring admission to University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) in Birmingham, UK between 10 March 2020 and 17 April 2020 were included.\n\n Standardised admission ratio (SAR) and standardised mortality ratio (SMR) were calculated using observed COVID-19 admissions/deaths and 2011 census data.\n\n Adjusted HR for mortality was estimated using Cox proportional hazard model adjusting and propensity score matching.\n\n\nResults\nAll patients admitted to UHB with COVID-19 during the study period were included (2217 in total).\n\n 58% were male, 69.5% were white and the majority (80.2%) had comorbidities.\n\n 18.5% were of South Asian ethnicity, and these patients were more likely to be younger and have no comorbidities, but twice the prevalence of diabetes than white patients.\n\n SAR and SMR suggested more admissions and deaths in South Asian patients than would be predicted and they were more likely to present with severe disease despite no delay in presentation since symptom onset.\n\n South Asian ethnicity was associated with an increased risk of death, both by Cox regression (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8), after adjusting for age, sex, deprivation and comorbidities, and by propensity score matching, matching for the same factors but categorising ethnicity into South Asian or not (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.6).\n\n\nConclusions\nThose of South Asian ethnicity appear at risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes.\n\n Further studies need to establish the underlying mechanistic

middle-income countries: reimagining global mental health","abstract":"Most of the global population live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), which have historically received a small fraction of global resources for mental health.\n The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly in many of these countries.\n This Review examines the mental health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs in four parts.\n First, we review the emerging literature on the impact of the pandemic on mental health, which shows high rates of psychological distress and early warning signs of an increase in mental health disorders.\n Second, we assess the responses in different countries, noting the swift and diverse responses to address mental health in some countries, particularly through the development of national COVID-19 response plans for mental health services, implementation of WHO guidance, and deployment of digital platforms, signifying a welcome recognition of the salience of mental health.\n Third, we consider the opportunity that the pandemic presents to reimagine global mental health, especially through shifting the balance of power from high-income countries to LMICs and from narrow biomedical approaches to community-oriented psychosocial perspectives, in setting priorities for interventions and research.\n Finally, we present a vision for the concept of building back better the mental health systems in LMICs with a focus on key strategies; notably, fully integrating mental health in plans for universal health coverage, enhancing access to psychosocial interventions through task sharing, leveraging digital technologies for various mental health tasks, eliminating coercion in mental health care, and addressing the needs of neglected populations, such as children and people with substance use disorders.\n Our recommendations are relevant for the mental health of populations and functioning of health systems in not only LMICs but also high-income countries impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with wide disparities in quality of and access to mental health care.\n","id":"PMC9764935","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

unprecedented health care crisis.\n The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases.\n For these regions, health care delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and health care workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment.\n Although mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as the disease advances.\n Thoracic imaging with chest radiography and CT are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19 has not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pretest probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints.\n To address this deficit, a multidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing patients with COVID-19 across a spectrum of health care environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints.\n Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based on the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide.\n The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of chest radiography and CT in the management of

Body Composition of Sarcopenia and Sarcopenic Obesity: Predictors of Postoperative Complications and Survival in Patients with Locally Advanced Esophageal Adenocarcinoma","abstract":"Simple Summary\nThe incidence of esophageal cancer is constantly rising and patients are often diagnosed at an advanced stage.\n\n Surgical resection, if possible, is the curative treatment of choice.\n\n However, esophagectomy for cancer is a major surgical procedure and is associated with perioperative morbidity.\n\n Preoperative staging examinations are carried out on every patient, and imaging datasets contain valuable information about the patients physical condition beyond the routinely assessed tumor extent.\n\n In this study, the abdominal muscle and fat mass were quantified during the preoperative staging and postoperative follow-up of 85 patients with locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma, and these imaging biomarkers were correlated with surgical complications and patient outcomes.\n\n Our analysis showed that sarcopenic patients with low muscle mass were more likely to have major complications and that hospitalization was prolonged, especially in patients with sarcopenic obesity.\n\n Low preoperative muscle mass and its decrease during the follow-up also predicted poorer overall survival.\n\n\nAbstract\nBackground: To assess the impact of body composition imaging biomarkers in computed tomography (CT) on the perioperative morbidity and survival after surgery of patients with esophageal cancer (EC).\n\n Methods: Eighty-five patients who underwent esophagectomy for locally advanced EC after neoadjuvant therapy between 2014 and 2019 were retrospectively enrolled.\n\n Pre- and postoperative CT scans were used to assess the body composition imaging biomarkers (visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) areas, psoas muscle area (PMA) and volume (PMV), total abdominal muscle area (TAMA)).\n\n Sarcopenia was defined as lumbar skeletal muscle index (LSMI) ?38.5 cm2/m2 in women and ?52.4 cm2/m2 in men.\n\n Patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ?30 were considered obese.\n\n These imaging biomarkers were correlated with major complications, anastomotic leakage, postoperative pneumonia, duration of postoperative hospitalization, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).\n\n Results: Preoperatively, sarcopenia was identified in 58 patients (68.2%), and sarcopenic obesity was present in 7 patients (8.2%).\n\n Sarcopenic patients were found to have an elevated risk for the occurrence of major complications (OR: 2.587, p = 0.048) and prolonged hospitalization (32 d vs.\n\n 19 d, p = 0.040).\n\n Patients with sarcopenic obesity had a significantly higher risk for postoperative pneumonia (OR: 6.364 p = 0.018) and a longer postoperative hospital stay (71 d vs.\n\n 24 d, p = 0.021).\n\n Neither sarcopenia nor sarcopenic obesity was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of anastomotic leakage (p &gt; 0.05).\n\n Low preoperative muscle biomarkers (PMA and PMV) and their decrease (?PMV and ?TAMA) during the follow-up period significantly correlated with shorter DFS and OS (p = 0.005 to 0.048).\n\n Conclusion: CT body composition imaging biomarkers can identify high-risk patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer undergoing surgery.\n\n Sarcopenic patients have a higher risk of major complications, and patients with sarcopenic obesity are more prone to postoperative pneumonia.\n\n Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are both subsequently associated with a prolonged hospitalization.\n\n Low preoperative muscle mass and its decrease during the postoperative follow-up are associated with lower DFS and OS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8230687","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Uli","surname":"Fehrenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tilo","surname":"Wuensch","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tilo","surname":"Wuensch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pia","surname":"Gabriel","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Pia","surname":"Gabriel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Segger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Takeru","surname":"Yamaguchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Timo

million people in England: a prospective, community-based, cohort study","abstract":"Background\nObesity is a major risk factor for adverse outcomes after infection with SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to examine this association, including interactions with demographic and behavioural characteristics, type 2 diabetes, and other health conditions.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this prospective, community-based, cohort study, we used de-identified patient-level data from the QResearch database of general practices in England, UK.\n\n We extracted data for patients aged 20 years and older who were registered at a practice eligible for inclusion in the QResearch database between Jan 24, 2020 (date of the first recorded infection in the UK) and April 30, 2020, and with available data on BMI.\n\n Data extracted included demographic, clinical, clinical values linked with Public Health England's database of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and death certificates from the Office of National Statistics.\n\n Outcomes, as a proxy measure of severe COVID-19, were admission to hospital, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and death due to COVID-19. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the risk of severe COVID-19, sequentially adjusting for demographic characteristics, behavioural factors, and comorbidities.\n\n\nFindings\nAmong 6?910?695 eligible individuals (mean BMI 26·78 kg/m2 [SD 5·59]), 13?503 (0·20%) were admitted to hospital, 1601 (0·02%) to an ICU, and 5479 (0·08%) died after a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. We found J-shaped associations between BMI and admission to hospital due to COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per kg/m2 from the nadir at BMI of 23 kg/m2 of 1·05 [95% CI 1·051·05]) and death (1·04 [1·041·05]), and a linear association across the whole BMI range with ICU admission (1·10 [1·091·10]).\n\n We found a significant interaction between BMI and age and ethnicity, with higher HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for younger people (adjusted HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for hospital admission 1·09 [95% CI 1·081·10] in 2039 years age group vs 80100 years group 1·01 [1·001·02]) and Black people than White people (1·07 [1·061·08] vs 1·04 [1·041·05]).\n\n The risk of admission to hospital and ICU due to COVID-19 associated with unit increase in BMI was slightly lower in people with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease than in those without these morbidities.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAt a BMI of more than 23 kg/m2, we found a linear increase in risk of severe COVID-19 leading to admission to hospital and death, and a linear increase in admission to an ICU across the whole BMI range, which is not attributable to excess risks of related diseases.\n\n The relative risk due to increasing BMI is particularly notable people younger than 40 years and of Black ethnicity.\n\n\nFunding\nNIHR Oxford Biomedical Research

we evaluated COVID-19 autopsy cases and deeply profiled the response of adipose tissue to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.\n In COVID-19 autopsy cases, we identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in adipocytes with an associated inflammatory infiltrate.\n We identified two distinct cellular targets of infection: adipocytes and a subset of inflammatory adipose tissue-resident macrophages.\n Mature adipocytes were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection; although macrophages were abortively infected, SARS-CoV-2 initiated inflammatory responses within both the infected macrophages and bystander preadipocytes.\n These

is an increasing number of elderly patients with chronic diseases being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n More than half of the survivors of critical illness suffer from medium-term or long-term cognitive, psychological and/or physical impairments after ICU discharge, which is recognised as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS).\n\n There are evidence-based and consensus-based quality indicators (QIs) in intensive care medicine, which have a positive influence on patients long-term outcomes if adhered to.\n\n\nMethods and analysis\nThe protocol of a multicentre, pragmatic, stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled, quality improvement trial is presented.\n\n During 3 predefined steps, 12 academic hospitals in Berlin and Brandenburg, Germany, are randomly selected to move in a one-way crossover from the control to the intervention condition.\n\n After a multifactorial training programme on QIs and clinical outcomes for site personnel, ICUs will receive an adapted, interprofessional protocol for a complex telehealth intervention comprising of daily telemedical rounds at ICU.\n\n The targeted sample size is 1431 patients.\n\n The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on the adherence to eight QIs daily measured during the patients ICU stay, compared with standard of care.\n\n Furthermore, the impact on long-term recovery such as PICS-related, patient-centred outcomes including health-related quality of life, mental health, clinical assessments of cognition and physical function, all-cause mortality and cost-effectiveness 3 and 6 months after ICU discharge will be evaluated.\n\n\nEthics and dissemination\nThis protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the CharitéUniversitätsmedizin, Berlin, Germany (EA1/006/18).\n\n The results will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and presented at international conferences.\n\n Study findings will also be disseminated via the

review: intensive care unit acquired weakness","abstract":"A substantial number of patients admitted to the ICU because of an acute illness, complicated surgery, severe trauma, or burn injury will develop a de novo form of muscle weakness during the ICU stay that is referred to as intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW).\n This ICUAW evoked by critical illness can be due to axonal neuropathy, primary myopathy, or both.\n Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms comprise microvascular, electrical, metabolic, and bioenergetic alterations, interacting in a complex way and culminating in loss of muscle strength and/or muscle atrophy.\n ICUAW is typically symmetrical and affects predominantly proximal limb muscles and respiratory muscles, whereas facial and ocular muscles are often spared.\n The main risk factors for ICUAW include high severity of illness upon admission, sepsis, multiple organ failure, prolonged immobilization, and hyperglycemia, and also older patients have a higher risk.\n The role of corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents remains unclear.\n ICUAW is diagnosed in awake and cooperative patients by bedside manual testing of muscle strength and the severity is scored by the Medical Research Council sum score.\n In cases of atypical clinical presentation or evolution, additional electrophysiological testing may be required for differential diagnosis.\n The cornerstones of prevention are aggressive treatment of sepsis, early mobilization, preventing hyperglycemia with insulin, and avoiding the use parenteral nutrition during the first week of critical illness.\n Weak patients clearly have worse acute outcomes and consume more healthcare resources.\n Recovery usually occurs within weeks or months, although it may be incomplete with weakness persisting up to 2 years after ICU discharge.\n Prognosis appears compromised when the cause of ICUAW involves critical illness polyneuropathy, whereas isolated critical illness myopathy may have a better prognosis.\n In addition, ICUAW has shown to contribute to the risk of 1-year mortality.\n Future research should focus on new preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for this detrimental complication of critical illness and on clarifying how ICUAW contributes to poor longer-term prognosis.\n","id":"PMC4526175","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS?CoV?2 (previously known as 2019?nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world.\n This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS?CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS?CoV and MERS?CoV.\n The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID?19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously.\n Additionally, some patients with COVID?19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases.\n The infection of SARS?CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected.\n Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse?connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways.\n Considering the high similarity between SARS?CoV and SARS?CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS?CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID?19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS?CoV?2?induced respiratory failure.\n","id":"PMC7228394","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

in the respiratory failure of COVID?19 patients","abstract":"Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS?CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS?CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS?CoV?2 (previously known as 2019?nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world.\n This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS?CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS?CoV and MERS?CoV.\n The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID?19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously.\n Additionally, some patients with COVID?19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases.\n The infection of SARS?CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected.\n Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse?connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways.\n Considering the high similarity between SARS?CoV and SARS?CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS?CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID?19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS?CoV?2?induced respiratory failure.\n","id":"PMC7228394","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

cured cases has increased significantly.\n\n Further monitoring of the disease prognosis and effective control of the relapse of the epidemic has become the next focus of work.\n\n This study analysed the clinical prognosis of discharged COVID?19 patients by monitoring their SAR?CoV?2 nucleic acid status, which provided a theoretical basis for medical institutions to formulate discharge standards and follow?up management for COVID?19 patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe included 13 discharged COVID?19 patients who were quarantined for 4 weeks at home.\n\n The patient's daily clinical signs were recorded and sputum and faecal specimens were regularly sent for detection of SARS?CoV?2 nucleic acid.\n\n\nResults\nThe time between initial symptoms and meeting discharge criteria was 18 to 44 days with an average of 25?±?6 days.\n\n The faecal samples of two patients still tested positive after meeting the discharge criteria and the sputum samples of four patients returned positive 5 to 14 days after discharge.\n\n The rate of the recurring positive test result in samples from the respiratory system was 31% (4/13).\n\n\nConclusion\nUnder the present discharge criteria, the high presence of SARS?CoV?2 nucleic acid in faecal and respiratory samples of discharged COVID?19 patients indicates potential infectivity.\n\n Therefore, we suggest that faecal virus nucleic acid should be tested as a routine monitoring index for COVID?19 and a negative result be added to the criteria.\n\n Simultaneously, we should strengthen the regular follow?up of discharged patients with continuous monitoring of the recurrence of viral nucleic acid.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7264799","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had

(COVID-19), acute kidney injury and proteinuria have also been observed.\n Currently, detailed pathologic examination of kidney damage in critically ill patients with COVID-19 has been lacking.\n To help define this we analyzed kidney abnormalities in 26 autopsies of patients with COVID-19 by light microscopy, ultrastructural observation and immunostaining.\n Patients were on average 69 years (19 male and 7 female) with respiratory failure associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome as the cause of death.\n Nine of the 26 showed clinical signs of kidney injury that included increased serum creatinine and/or new-onset proteinuria.\n By light microscopy, diffuse proximal tubule injury with the loss of brush border, non-isometric vacuolar degeneration, and even frank necrosis was observed.\n Occasional hemosiderin granules and pigmented casts were identified.\n There were prominent erythrocyte aggregates obstructing the lumen of capillaries without platelet or fibrinoid material.\n Evidence of vasculitis, interstitial inflammation or hemorrhage was absent.\n Electron microscopic examination showed clusters of coronavirus-like particles with distinctive spikes in the tubular epithelium and podocytes.\n Furthermore, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 was found to be upregulated in patients with COVID-19, and immunostaining with SARS-CoV nucleoprotein antibody was positive in tubules.\n In addition to the direct virulence of SARS-CoV-2, factors contributing to acute kidney injury included systemic hypoxia, abnormal coagulation, and possible drug or hyperventilation-relevant rhabdomyolysis.\n Thus, our studies provide direct evidence of the invasion of SARSCoV-2 into kidney tissue.\n These findings will greatly add to the current understanding of

Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital that also encompassed three affiliates following this major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020 of whom 113 (16.1%) died in hospital.\n Median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range, 50-71), including 367 men and 334 women.\n On admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria.\n The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively.\n During the study period, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients.\n Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death.\n Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1+ (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2+?3+ (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1+ (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2+?3+ (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count.\n Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality.\n Hence, clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe COVID-19.","id":"PMC7110296","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International Society of Nephrology.

model.\n To investigate whether and which structural protein of SARS-CoV induced transcription of hfgl2 prothrombinase gene, three eukaryotic expression plasmids expressing nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane protein (M) and spike protein 2 (S2) of SARS-CoV were co-transfected with hfgl2 promoter luciferase-reporter plasmids and ?-galactosidase plasmid in CHO cells, respectively.\n M, N and S2 protein of SARS-CoV were detected by western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis.\n Further assays demonstrated that expression of hfgl2 gene was related with N protein, but not with M or S2 protein in THP-1 cells and Vero cells.\n N protein significantly induced functional procoagulant activity in comparison with control group.\n Luciferase assay showed that N protein of SARS-CoV could activate the transcription of hfgl2 promoter compared with the pcDNA3.1 empty vector.\n Site-directed mutagenesis and EMSA assay further demonstrated that transcription factor C/EBP alpha band with its cognate cis-element in hfgl2 promoter.\n The results showed that N protein of SARS-CoV induced hfgl2 gene transcription dependent on the transcription factor C/EBP alpha, which maybe contribute to

disease","abstract":"id='Par1'>TTP is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia associated with brain and kidney dysfunction.\n It occurs due to ADAMTS13 deficiency.\n TTP-like syndrome occurs in critically ill patients with the similar hematologic changes and additional organ dysfunction syndromes.\n Vascular microthrombotic disease (VMTD) includes both TTP and TTP-like syndrome because their underlying pathology is the same disseminated intravascular microthrombosis (DIT).\n Microthrombi are composed of platelet-unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF) complexes.\n TTP occurs as a result of accumulation of circulating ULVWF secondary to ADAMTS13 deficiency.\n This protease deficiency triggers microthrombogenesis, leading to microthrombi formation in microcirculation.\n Unlike TTP, TTP-like syndrome occurs in critical illnesses due to complement activation.\n Terminal C5b-9 complex causes channel formation to endothelial membrane, leading to endotheliopathy, which activates two different molecular pathways (i.\ne.\n, inflammatory and microthrombotic).\n Activation of inflammatory pathway triggers inflammation.\n Activation of microthrombotic pathway promotes platelet activation and excessive endothelial exocytosis of ULVWF from endothelial cells (ECs).\n Overexpressed and uncleaved ULVWF become anchored to ECs as long elongated strings to recruit activated platelets, and assemble microthrombi.\n In TTP, circulating microthrombi typically be lodged in microvasculature of the brain and kidney, but in TTP-like syndrome, microthrombi anchored to ECs of organs such as the lungs and liver as well as the brain and kidneys, leading to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome.\n TTP occurs as hereditary or autoimmune disease and is the phenotype of ADAMTS13 deficiency-associated VMTD.\n But TTP-like syndrome is hemostatic disorder occurring in critical illnesses and is the phenotype of endotheliopathy-associated VMTD.\n Thus, this authors contention is TTP and TTP-like syndrome are two distinctly different disorders with dissimilar underlying pathology and pathogenesis.\n","id":"PMC6087012","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Jae

is frequently complicated by coagulopathy and, in about 35 % of severe cases, by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\n In Japan, aggressive treatment of septic DIC is encouraged using antithrombin and recombinant thrombomodulin.\n The macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils are a source of TF and participate in the direct activation of the coagulation cascade in the early phases of sepsis.\n And activated factor X (FXa), which is involved in hemostasis, thrombogenesis, inflammation, and cellular immune responses, induces TF expression in human peripheral monocytes and, conversely, that inhibition of FXa activity reduces TF expression.\n Both inflammation and coagulation play an important role in DIC due to sepsis.\n In addition to inflammatory cytokines (TNF-?, IL-1 and so on), HMGB1 has recently been shown to mediate the lethal late phase of sepsis and caused coagulopathy.\n TM not only binds HMGB1 but also aids the proteolytic cleavage of HMGB1 by thrombin.\n There have been many reports of the efficacy of recombinant TM and antithrombin for treatment of septic DIC from Japan.\n Further investigation of the efficacy of recombinant TM and AT in countries

informative biomarkers to improve diagnosis, prognostic evaluation or risk-stratification of patients with sepsis.\n\n\nMethods\nThe objective was to review the literature on the use of markers of EC activation as prognostic biomarkers in sepsis.\n\n MEDLINE was searched for publications using the keyword 'sepsis' and any of the identified endothelial-derived biomarkers in any searchable field.\n\n All clinical studies evaluating markers reflecting activation of ECs were included.\n\n Studies evaluating other exogenous mediators of EC dysfunction and studies of patients with malaria and febrile neutropenia were excluded.\n\n\nResults\nSixty-one studies were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria.\n\n Overall, published studies report positive correlations between multiple EC-derived molecules and the diagnosis of sepsis, supporting the critical role of EC activation in sepsis.\n\n Multiple studies also reported positive associations for mortality and severity of illness, although these results were less consistent than for the presence of sepsis.\n\n Very few studies, however, reported thresholds or receiver operating characteristics that would establish these molecules as clinically-relevant biomarkers in sepsis.\n\n\nConclusions\nMultiple endothelial-derived molecules are positively correlated with the presence of sepsis in humans, and variably correlated to other clinically-important outcomes.\n\n The clinical utility of these biomarkers is limited by a lack of assay standardization, unknown receiver operating characteristics and lack of

of the complement pathways, as well as secreting and anchoring ultra-large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimers in long string-like structures that initiate platelet adhesion during hemostasis and thrombosis.\n\n The alternative complement pathway (AP) is an important non-antibody-requiring host defense system.\n\n Thrombotic microangiopathies can be associated with defective regulation of the AP (atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome) or with inadequate cleavage by ADAMTS-13 of ULVWF multimeric strings secreted by/anchored to ECs (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura).\n\n Our goal was to determine if EC-anchored ULVWF strings caused the assembly and activation of AP components, thereby linking two essential defense mechanisms.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe quantified gene expression of these complement components in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by real-time PCR: C3 and C5; complement factor (CF) B, CFD, CFP, CFH and CFI of the AP; and C4 of the classical and lectin (but not alternative) complement pathways.\n\n We used fluorescent microscopy, monospecific antibodies against complement components, fluorescent secondary antibodies, and the analysis of &gt;150 images to quantify the attachment of HUVEC-released complement proteins to ULVWF strings secreted by, and anchored to, the HUVECs (under conditions of ADAMTS-13 inhibition).\n\n We found that HUVEC-released C4 did not attach to ULVWF strings, ruling out activation of the classical and lectin pathways by the strings.\n\n In contrast, C3, FB, FD, FP and C5, FH and FI attached to ULVWF strings in quantitative patterns consistent with assembly of the AP components into active complexes.\n\n This was verified when non-functional FB blocked the formation of AP C3 convertase complexes (C3bBb) on ULVWF strings.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nAP components are assembled and activated on EC-secreted/anchored ULVWF multimeric strings.\n\n Our findings provide one possible

response syndrome [SIRS] sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock) and their relationships with infection.\n¶Design: Review of published cohort studies examining the epidemiology of the septic syndromes, with emphasis on intensive care unit (ICU) patients.\n¶Results: The prevalence of SIRS is very high, affecting one-third of all in-hospital patients, and &gt; 50 % of all ICU patients; in surgical ICU patients, SIRS occurs in &gt; 80 % patients.\n Trauma patients are at particularly high risk of SIRS, and most these patients do not have infection documented.\n The prevalence of infection and bacteraemia increases with the number of SIRS criteria met, and with increasing severity of the septic syndromes.\n About one-third of patients with SIRS have or evolve to sepsis.\n Sepsis may occur in approximately 25 % of ICU patients, and bacteraemic sepsis in 10 %.\n In such patients, sepsis evolves to severe sepsis in &gt; 50 % of cases, whereas evolution to severe sepsis in non-ICU patients is about 25 %.\n Severe sepsis and septic shock occur in 2 %3 % of ward patients and 10 %15 % or more ICU patients, depending on the case-mix; 25 % of patients with severe sepsis have shock.\n There is a graded severity from SIRS to sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, with an associated 28-d mortality of approximately 10 %, 20 %, 20 %40 %, and 40 %60 %, respectively.\n Mortality rates are similar within each stage, whether infection is documented or not, and microbiological characteristics of infection do not substantially influence outcome, although the source of infection does.\n While about three of four deaths occur during the first months after sepsis, the septic syndromes significantly impact on long-term outcome, with an estimated 50 % reduction of life expectancy over the following five years.\n The major determinants of outcome, both short-term and long-term, of patients with sepsis are the severity of underlying diseases and comorbidities, the presence of shock and organ failures at onset of sepsis or evolving thereafter.\n It has been estimated that two-thirds of the overall mortality can be attributed to sepsis.\n¶Conclusions: The prevalence of sepsis in ICU patients is very high, and most patients have clinically or microbiologically documented infection, except in specific subset of patients.\n The prognosis of septic syndromes is related to underlying diseases and the severity of the inflammatory response and its sequelae, reflected in shock and organ

thrombocytopenia (32.4% vs.\n\n 24.5%, P = 0.12).\n\n However, while 15 of 86 patients (17.4%) who resolved their thrombocytopenia died, 32 of 59 patients (54.2%) whose thrombocytopenia did not resolve died (P &lt; 0.01).\n\n The association between non-resolution of thrombocytopenia and mortality remained significant after adjusting for age, APACHE III score and compliance with a sepsis resuscitation bundle (P &lt; 0.01).\n\n\nConclusions\nThrombocytopenia is common in patients who are admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and septic shock.\n\n Patients with thrombocytopenia had more episodes of major bleeding, increased incidence of acute kidney injury, and prolonged ICU stay.\n\n Non-resolution of thrombocytopenia, but not thrombocytopenia itself, was associated with increased 28-day mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4373028","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to describe the complex pathophysiologic response to an insult such as infection, trauma, burns, pancreatitis, or a variety of other injuries came from a 1991 consensus conference charged with the task of developing an easy-to-apply set of clinical parameters to aid in the early identification of potential candidates to enter into clinical trials to evaluate new treatments for sepsis.\n There was recognition that a diverse group of injuries produced a common inflammatory response in the host and provided attractive targets for new anti-inflammatory molecules designed to prevent further propagation and/or provide specific treatment.\n Effective application of these new anti-inflammatory strategies necessitated identification of early clinical markers that could be assessed in real-time and were likely to define a population of patients that would have a beneficial response to the targeted intervention.\n It was felt that early clinical manifestations might be more readily available to clinicians than more sophisticated and specific assays for inflammatory substances that were systemically released by the network of injurious inflammatory events.\n Therefore, the early definition of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) was built upon a foundation of basic clinical and laboratory abnormalities that were readily available in almost all clinical settings.\n With further refinement, it was hoped, that this definition would have a high degree of sensitivity, coupled with a reasonable degree of specificity.\n This manuscript reviews the derivation, application, utilization, potential benefits, and speculation regarding the future of the SIRS definition.\n","id":"PMC3916374","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Landes Bioscience","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert

retrospective observational single-centre study on the use of TPE as rescue therapy in 23 consecutive patients with severe sepsis or septic shock from 2005 to 2012. Main surrogate markers of multiple organ failure (MOF) before, during and after TPE as well as survival rates are reported.\n\n\nResults\nAt baseline, mean SOFA score was 13 (standard deviation [SD] 4) and median number of failed organ-systems was 5 (interquartile range [IQR] 45).\n\n TPEs were performed 3 days (IQR 210) after symptom onset and 1 day (IQR 08) after ICU admission.\n\n The median total exchange volume was 3750 ml (IQR 25006000), which corresponded to a mean of 1.5 times (SD 0.9) the individual plasma volume.\n\n Fresh frozen plasma was used in all but one treatments as replacement fluid.\n\n Net fluid balance decreased significantly within 12 hrs following the first TPE procedure by a median of 720 mL (p?=?0.002), irrespective of outcome.\n\n Reductions of norepinephrine dose and improvement in cardiac index were observed in individual survivors, but this was not significant for the overall cohort (p?=?0.574).\n\n Platelet counts decreased irrespective of outcome between days 0 and 2 (p?&lt;?0.003), and increased thereafter in many survivors.\n\n There was a non-significant trend towards younger age and higher procalcitonin levels among survivors.\n\n Nine out of 23 TPE treated patients (39%) survived until ICU discharge (among them 3 patients with baseline SOFA scores of 15, 17, and 20).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data suggest that some patients with severe sepsis and septic shock may experience hemodynamic stabilisation by early TPE therapy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3986467","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Johannes","surname":"Hadem","email":"hadem.johannes@mh-hannover.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carsten","surname":"Hafer","email":"c.hafer@comlink.org","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrea S","surname":"Schneider","email":"andrea.s.schneider@gmx.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olaf","surname":"Wiesner","email":"wiesner.olaf@mh-hannover.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gernot","surname":"Beutel","email":"beutel.gernot@mh-hannover.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Fuehner","email":"fuehner.thomas@mh-hannover.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tobias","surname":"Welte","email":"welte.tobias@mh-hannover.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marius M","surname":"Hoeper","email":"hoeper.marius@mh-hannover.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jan T","surname":"Kielstein","email":"kielstein@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/jca.21296","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Therapeutic plasma exchange in the management of sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome: a report of three cases","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.transci.2008.03.009","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Apheresis in patients with severe sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/s13054-014-0699-2","date":"2014-11-27","title":"The efficacy and safety of plasma exchange in patients with sepsis and septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Introduction\nSepsis and septic shock are leading causes of intensive care unit (ICU) mortality.\n\n They are characterized by excessive inflammation, upregulation of procoagulant proteins and depletion of natural anticoagulants.\n\n Plasma exchange has the potential to improve survival in sepsis by removing inflammatory cytokines and restoring deficient plasma proteins.\n\n The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plasma exchange in patients with sepsis.\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, reference lists of relevant articles, and grey literature for relevant citations.\n\n We included randomized controlled trials comparing plasma exchange or plasma filtration with usual care in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock.\n\n Two reviewers independently identified trials, extracted trial-level data and performed risk of bias assessments using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.\n\n The primary outcome was all-cause mortality reported at longest follow-up.\n\n Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1,957 records identified, we included four unique trials enrolling a total of 194 patients (one enrolling adults only, two enrolling children only, one enrolling adults and children).\n\n The mean age of adult patients ranged from 38 to 53 years (n?=?128) and the mean age of children ranged from 0.9 to 18 years (n?=?66).\n\n All trials were at unclear to high risk of bias.\n\n The use of plasma exchange was not associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.52, I2 60%).\n\n In adults, plasma exchange was associated with reduced mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96;

is important to understand their biological functions.\n Typically, miRNA-encoding genes are transcribed by RNA Polymerase II and generate primary transcripts that are processed by RNase III-endonucleases DROSHA and DICER into small RNAs of approximately 21 nucleotides.\n All miRNAs are loaded into Argonaute proteins in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and act as post-transcriptional regulators by binding to the 3?- untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs.\n This seed-dependent miRNA binding inhibits the translation and/or promotes the degradation of mRNA targets.\n Surprisingly, recent data presents evidence for a target-mediated decay mechanism that controls the level of specific miRNAs.\n In addition, several non-canonical miRNA-containing genes have been recently described and unexpected functions of miRNAs have been identified.\n For instance, several miRNAs are located in the nucleus, where they are involved in the transcriptional activation or silencing of target genes.\n These epigenetic modifiers are recruited by RISC and guided by miRNAs to specific loci in the genome.\n Here, we will review non-canonical aspects of miRNA

Neovascularization encompasses both angiogenesis, the sprouting of new capillaries from existing vessels, and arteriogenesis, the maturation of preexisting collateral arterioles into fully functional arteries.\n Both angiogenesis and arteriogenesis are highly multifactorial processes that require a multifactorial regulator to be stimulated simultaneously.\n MicroRNAs can regulate both angiogenesis and arteriogenesis due to their ability to modulate expression of many genes simultaneously.\n Recent studies have revealed that many microRNAs have variants with altered terminal sequences, known as isomiRs.\n Additionally, endogenous microRNAs have been identified that carry biochemically modified nucleotides, revealing a dynamic microRNA epitranscriptome.\n Both types of microRNA alterations were shown to be dynamically regulated in response to ischemia and are able to influence neovascularization by affecting the microRNAs biogenesis, or even its silencing activity.\n Therefore, these novel regulatory layers influence microRNA functioning and could provide new opportunities to stimulate neovascularization.\n In this review we will highlight the formation and function of isomiRs and

Despite these initial findings, the biophysical properties of the TIM-EBOV interaction, such as the mechanical strength of the TIM-PS bond that allows the virus-cell interaction to resist external mechanical perturbations, have not yet been characterized.\n This study utilizes single-molecule force spectroscopy to quantify the specific interaction forces between TIM-1 or TIM-4 and the following binding partners: PS, EBOV virus-like particle, and EBOV glycoprotein/vesicular stomatitis virus pseudovirion.\n Depending on the loading rates, the unbinding forces between TIM and ligands ranged from 40 to 100 pN, suggesting that TIM-EBOV interactions are mechanically comparable to previously reported adhesion moleculeligand interactions.\n The TIM-4PS interaction is more resistant to mechanical force than the TIM-1PS interaction.\n We have developed a simple model for virushost cell interaction that is driven by its adhesion to cell surface receptors and resisted by membrane

mimicry.\n Here we show that this broadly shared uptake mechanism is utilized by SARS-CoV-2 in cells that express low surface levels of ACE2. Expression of members of the TIM (TIM-1 and TIM-4) and TAM (AXL) families of PS receptors enhance SARS-CoV-2 binding to cells, facilitate internalization of fluorescently-labeled virions and increase ACE2-dependent infection of SARS-CoV-2; however, PS receptors alone did not mediate infection.\n We were unable to detect direct interactions of the PS receptor AXL with purified SARS-CoV-2 spike, contrary to a previous report.\n Instead, our studies indicate that the PS receptors interact with PS on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions.\n In support of this, we demonstrate that: 1) significant quantities of PS are located on the outer leaflet of SARS-CoV-2 virions, 2) PS liposomes, but not phosphatidylcholine liposomes, reduced entry of VSV/Spike pseudovirions and 3) an established mutant of TIM-1 which does not bind to PS is unable to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2. As AXL is an abundant PS receptor on a number of airway lines, we evaluated small molecule inhibitors of AXL signaling such as bemcentinib for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Bemcentinib robustly inhibited virus infection of Vero E6 cells as well as multiple human lung cell lines that expressed AXL.\n This inhibition correlated well with inhibitors that block endosomal acidification and cathepsin activity, consistent with AXL-mediated uptake of SARS-CoV-2 into the endosomal compartment.\n We extended our observations to the related betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), showing that inhibition or ablation of AXL reduces MHV infection of murine cells.\n In total, our findings provide evidence that PS receptors facilitate infection of the pandemic

endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) is a network of membrane-bound proteoglycans and glycoproteins lining the vascular endothelium that plays a key role in regulating endothelial barrier function.\n Here, we demonstrate that DENV NS1 disrupts the EGL on human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, inducing degradation of sialic acid and shedding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans.\n This effect

with whole spike protein, its receptor-binding domain, or the integrin-binding tripeptide RGD induced the nuclear translocation of NF-?B and subsequent expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules (VCAM1 and ICAM1), coagulation factors (TF and FVIII), proinflammatory cytokines (TNF?, IL-1?, and IL-6), and ACE2, as well as the adhesion of peripheral blood leukocytes and hyperpermeability of the EC monolayer.\n In addition, inhibitors of integrin ?5?1 activation prevented these effects.\n Furthermore, these vascular effects occur in vivo, as revealed by the intravenous administration of spike, which increased expression of ICAM1, VCAM1, CD45, TNF?, IL-1?, and IL-6 in the lung, liver, kidney, and eye, and the intravitreal injection of spike, which disrupted the barrier function of retinal capillaries.\n We suggest that the spike protein, through its RGD motif in the receptor-binding domain, binds to integrin ?5?1 in ECs to activate the NF-?B target gene expression programs responsible for vascular leakage and leukocyte adhesion.\n These findings uncover a new direct action of SARS-CoV-2 on EC dysfunction and introduce integrin ?5?1 as a promising target for treating

demonstrated that occludin could regulate the integrity and permeability of the BBB.\n The function of BBB depends on the level of occludin protein expression in brain endothelial cells.\n Moreover, occludin may serve as a potential biomarker for hemorrhage transformation after acute ischemic stroke.\n In this review, we summarize the role of occludin in BBB integrity and the regulatory mechanisms of occludin in the permeability of BBB after ischemic stroke.\n Multiple factors have been found to regulate occludin protein functions in maintaining BBB permeability, such as Matrix metalloproteinas-mediated cleavage, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and related inflammatory factors.\n In addition, various signaling pathways participate in regulating the occludin expression, including nuclear factor-kappa B, mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein kinase c, RhoK, and ERK1/2. Emerging therapeutic interventions for ischemic stroke targeting occludin are described, including normobaric hyperoxia, Chinese medicine, chemical drugs, genes, steroid hormones, small molecular peptides, and other therapies.\n Since occludin has been shown to play a critical role in regulating BBB integrity, further preclinical studies will help evaluate and validate occludin as a viable

nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the systemic circulation is of great medical interest as various pathological conditions often lead to their impairment.\n Excessive leakage of blood-borne molecules into the parenchyma and the concomitant fluctuations in the microenvironment following a transient breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) during ischemic/hypoxic conditions or because of an autoimmune disease are detrimental to the physiological functioning of nervous tissue.\n On the other hand, the treatment of neurological disorders is often hampered as only minimal amounts of therapeutic agents are able to penetrate a fully functional BBB or blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier.\n An in-depth understanding of the molecular machinery governing the establishment and maintenance of these barriers is necessary to develop rational strategies allowing a controlled delivery of appropriate drugs to the CNS.\n At the basis of such tissue barriers are intimate cell-cell contacts (zonulae occludentes, tight junctions) which are present in all polarized epithelia and endothelia.\n By creating a paracellular diffusion constraint TJs enable the vectorial transport across cell monolayers.\n More recent findings indicate that functional barriers are already established during development, protecting the fetal brain.\n As an understanding of the biogenesis of TJs might reveal the underlying mechanisms of barrier formation during ontogenic development numerous in vitro systems have been developed to study the assembly and disassembly of TJs.\n In addition, monitoring the stage-specific expression of TJ-associated proteins during development has brought much insight into the developmental tightening of tissue barriers.\n Over the last two decades a detailed molecular map of transmembrane and cytoplasmic TJ-proteins has been identified.\n These proteins not only form a cell-cell adhesion structure, but integrate various signaling pathways, thereby directly or indirectly impacting upon processes such as cell-cell adhesion, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and transcriptional control.\n This review will provide a brief overview on the establishment of the BBB

mild dengue and severe dengue.\n Severe dengue is clinically manifested as serious complications, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and/or dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), which is mainly characterized by vascular leakage.\n Currently, the pathogenesis of severe dengue is not elucidated thoroughly, and there are no known therapeutic targets for controlling the disease effectively.\n This study aimed to further reveal the potential molecular mechanism of severe dengue.\n In this study, the long non-coding RNA, ERG-associated lncRNA (lncRNA-ERGAL), was activated and significantly up-regulated in DENV-infected vascular endothelial cells.\n After knockdown of lncRNA-ERGAL, the expression of ERG, VE-cadherin, and claudin-5 was repressed; besides, cell apoptosis was enhanced, and cytoskeletal remodeling was disordered, leading to instability and increased permeability of vascular endothelial barrier during DENV infection.\n Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay showed lncRNA-ERGAL to be mainly expressed in the cytoplasm.\n Moreover, the expression of miR-183-5p was found to increase during DENV infection and revealed to regulate ERG, junction-associated proteins, and the cytoskeletal structure after overexpression and knockdown.\n Then, ERGAL was confirmed to interact with miR-183-5p by luciferase reporter assay.\n Collectively, ERGAL acted as a miRNA sponge that can promote stability and integrity of vascular endothelial barrier during DENV infection via binding to miR-183-5p, thus revealing the potential molecular mechanism of severe dengue

Resistance (TEER) to investigate the parameters associated with dengue induced leakage.\n\n Three groups of individuals were tested: dengue-positives with plasma leakage (leakage), dengue-positives without plasma leakage (no leakage), and dengue-negatives (control).\n\n Data show that TEER values of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was significantly lower after incubation with serum from subjects of the leakage group in comparison to the no leakage or control groups.\n\n The serum levels of CXCL1, EGF, eotaxin, IFN-?, sCD40L, and platelets were significantly decreased in

cell tropism is a determinant of H5N1 pathogenesis in mammalian species","abstract":"The cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning the unusually high virulence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses in mammalian species remains unknown.\n Here, we investigated if the cell tropism of H5N1 virus is a determinant of enhanced virulence in mammalian species.\n We engineered H5N1 viruses with restricted cell tropism through the exploitation of cell type-specific microRNA expression by incorporating microRNA target sites into the viral genome.\n Restriction of H5N1 replication in endothelial cells via miR-126 ameliorated disease symptoms, prevented systemic viral spread and limited mortality, despite showing similar levels of peak viral replication in the lungs as compared to control virus-infected mice.\n Similarly, restriction of H5N1 replication in endothelial cells resulted in ameliorated disease symptoms and decreased viral spread in ferrets.\n Our studies demonstrate that H5N1 infection of endothelial cells results in excessive production of cytokines and reduces endothelial barrier integrity in the lungs, which culminates in vascular leakage and viral pneumonia.\n Importantly, our studies suggest a need for a combinational therapy that targets viral components, suppresses host immune responses, and improves endothelial barrier integrity for the treatment of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus infections.\n","id":"PMC5362246","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

response and bloodbrain barrier dysfunction during viral neuroinvasion","abstract":"The blood-brain barrier (BBB), which protects the CNS from pathogens, is composed of specialized brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) joined by tight junctions and ensheathed by pericytes and astrocyte endfeet.\n The stability of the BBB structure and function is of great significance for the maintenance of brain homeostasis.\n When a neurotropic virus invades the CNS via a hematogenous or non-hematogenous route, it may cause structural and functional disorders of the BBB, and also activate the BBB anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory innate immune response.\n This article focuses on the structural and functional changes that occur in the three main components of the BBB (endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes) in response to infection with neurotropic viruses transmitted by hematogenous routes, and also briefly describes the supportive effect of three cells on the BBB under normal physiological conditions.\n For example, all three types of cells express several PRRs, which can quickly sense the virus and make corresponding immune responses.\n The pro-inflammatory immune response will exacerbate the destruction of the BBB, while the anti-inflammatory immune response, based on type I IFN, consolidates the stability of the BBB.\n Exploring the details of the interaction between the host and the pathogen at the BBB during neurotropic virus infection will help to propose new treatments for viral encephalitis.\n Enhancing the defense function of the BBB, maintaining the integrity of the BBB, and suppressing the pro-inflammatory immune response of the BBB provide more ideas for limiting the neuroinvasion of neurotropic viruses.\n In the future, these new treatments are expected to cooperate with traditional antiviral methods to improve the therapeutic effect of viral encephalitis.\n","id":"PMC7882805","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"SAGE

that normally maintain homeostasis.\n This tightly regulated palette of functions includes control of haemostasis, fibrinolysis, vasomotion, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular permeability, and structure.\n While these functions participate in the moment-to-moment regulation of the circulation and coordinate many host defence mechanisms, they can also contribute to disease when their usually homeostatic and defensive functions over-reach and turn against the host.\n SARS-CoV-2, the aetiological agent of COVID-19, causes the current pandemic.\n It produces protean manifestations ranging from head to toe, wreaking seemingly indiscriminate havoc on multiple organ systems including the lungs, heart, brain, kidney, and vasculature.\n This essay explores the hypothesis that COVID-19, particularly in the later complicated stages, represents an endothelial disease.\n Cytokines, protein pro-inflammatory mediators, serve as key danger signals that shift endothelial functions from the homeostatic into the defensive mode.\n The endgame of COVID-19 usually involves a cytokine storm, a phlogistic phenomenon fed by well-understood positive feedback loops that govern cytokine production and overwhelm counter-regulatory mechanisms.\n The concept of COVID-19 as an endothelial disease provides a unifying pathophysiological picture of this raging infection, and also provides a framework

assessing the ability of promising bioactive compounds to overcome the BBB.\n\n To establish an improved human in vitro BBB model, we compared four currently available and well characterized immortalized human brain capillary endothelial cell lines, hCMEC/D3, hBMEC, TY10, and BB19, with respect to barrier tightness and paracellular permeability.\n\n Co-culture systems using immortalized human astrocytes (SVG-A cell line) and immortalized human pericytes (HBPCT cell line) were designed with the aim of positively influencing barrier tightness.\n\n\nMethods\nTight junction (TJ) formation was assessed by transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements using a conventional epithelial voltohmmeter (EVOM) and an automated CellZscope system which records TEER and cell layer capacitance (CCL) in real-time.\n\n\nResults\nThe four cell lines all expressed the endothelial cell type-specific adherens junction protein VE-cadherin.\n\n The TJ protein ZO-1 was expressed in hCMEC/D3 and in hBMEC cells.\n\n ZO-1 expression could be confirmed in hBMEC cells by immunocytochemical staining.\n\n Claudin-5 expression was detected in hCMEC/D3, TY10, and at a very low level in hBMEC cells.\n\n Highest TEER values and lowest paracellular permeability for Na-F and LY were obtained with mono-cultures of hBMEC cell line when cultivated on 24-well tissue culture inserts from Greiner Bio-one® (transparent PET membrane, 3.0 ?m pore size).\n\n In co-culture models with SVG-A and HBPCT cells, no increase of TEER could be observed, suggesting that none of the investigated endothelial cell lines responded positively to stimuli from immortalized astrocytic or pericytic cells.\n\n\nConclusions\nUnder the conditions examined in our experiments, hBMEC proved to be the most suitable human cell line for an in vitro BBB model concerning barrier tightness in a 24-well mono-culture system intended for higher throughput.\n\n This BBB model is being validated with several compounds (known to cross or not to cross the BBB), and will potentially be selected for the assessment of BBB permeation of bioactive natural

Regulates GLP-1-Mediated Insulin Release by Targeting ?-Arrestin 1","abstract":"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been shown to potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion binding GLP-1 receptor on pancreatic ? cells.\n ?-arrestin 1 (?ARR1) is known to regulate the desensitization of GLP-1 receptor.\n Mounting evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are fundamental in the regulation of ? cell function and insulin release.\n However, the regulation of GLP-1/?ARR1 pathways by miRs has never been explored.\n Our hypothesis is that specific miRs can modulate the GLP-1/?ARR1 axis in ? cells.\n To test this hypothesis, we applied a bioinformatic approach to detect miRs that could target ?ARR1; we identified hsa-miR-7-5p (miR-7) and we validated the specific interaction of this miR with ?ARR1. Then, we verified that GLP-1 was indeed able to regulate the transcription of miR-7 and ?ARR1, and that miR-7 significantly regulated GLP-1-induced insulin release and cyclic AMP (cAMP) production in ? cells.\n Taken together, our findings indicate, for the first time, that miR-7 plays a functional role in the regulation of GLP-1-mediated insulin release by targeting ?ARR1. These results have a decisive clinical impact given the importance of drugs modulating GLP-1 signaling in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n","id":"PMC7407368","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Alessandro","surname":"Matarese","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica","surname":"Gambardella","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Angela","surname":"Lombardi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xujun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gaetano","surname":"Santulli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/ehf2.12584","date":"2019-12-09","title":"Cardiomyocyte?derived exosomal microRNA?92a mediates post?ischemic myofibroblast activation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic>\n","abstract":"Aims\nWe hypothesize that specific microRNAs (miRNAs) within cardiomyocyte?derived exosomes play a pivotal role in the phenoconversion of cardiac myofibroblasts following myocardial infarction (MI).\n\n\nMethods and results\nWe used an established murine model of MI, obtained in vivo via ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery.\n\n We isolated adult cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, and we assessed the functional role of cardiomyocyte?derived exosomes and their molecular cargo in the activation of cardiac fibroblasts.\n\n We identified and biologically validated miR?92a as a transcriptional regulator of mothers against DPP homologues 7 (SMAD7), a known inhibitor of ??smooth muscle actin (??SMA), established marker of myofibroblast activation.\n\n We found that miR?92a was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) upregulated in cardiomyocyte?derived exosomes and in fibroblasts isolated after MI compared with SHAM conditions (n ? 6/group).\n\n We tested the activation of myofibroblasts by measuring the expression levels of ?SMA, periostin, and collagen.\n\n Primary isolated cardiac fibroblasts were activated both when incubated with cardiomyocyte?derived exosomes isolated from ischemic cardiomyocytes and when cultured in conditioned medium of post?MI cardiomyocytes, whereas no significant difference was observed following incubation with exosomes or medium from sham cardiomyocytes.\n\n These effects were attenuated when an inhibitor of exosome secretion, GW4869 (10 ?M for 12 h) was included in the experimental setting.\n\n Through means of specific miR?92a mimic and miR?92a inhibitor, we also verified the mechanistic contribution of miR?92a to the activation of cardiac fibroblasts.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results indicate for the first time that miR?92a is transferred to fibroblasts in form of exosomal cargo and is critical for cardiac myofibroblast activation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7083461","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Xujun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marco Bruno","surname":"Morelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alessandro","surname":"Matarese","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Celestino","surname":"Sardu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gaetano","surname":"Santulli","email":"gsantulli001@gmail.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/biomedicines8110462","date":"2020-10-29","title":"miR-98 Regulates TMPRSS2 Expression in Human Endothelial Cells: Key Implications for COVID-19","abstract":"The two main co-factors needed by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to enter human cells are angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).\n Here, we focused on the study of microRNAs that specifically target TMPRSS2.

for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004

infection.\n While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death.\n Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak.\n I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches.\n Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future.\n The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity.\n The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action.\n The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken.\n Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to

renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, as well as fluid and salt balance.\n Angiotensin II, a key effector peptide of the system, causes vasoconstriction and exerts multiple biological functions.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in generating angiotensin II from angiotensin I, and capillary blood vessels in the lung are one of the major sites of ACE expression and angiotensin II production in the human body.\n The RAS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis, both commonly seen in chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease.\n Recent studies indicate that the RAS also plays a critical role in acute lung diseases, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n ACE2, a close homologue of ACE, functions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system and was identified as a key receptor for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus infections.\n In the lung, ACE2 protects against acute lung injury in several animal models of ARDS.\n Thus, the RAS appears to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury.\n Indeed, increasing ACE2 activity might be a novel approach for the treatment of acute lung failure in several

severe cases resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a severe form of acute lung injury (ALI) that further contributes to morbidity.\n To date, no effective drugs that improve the clinical outcome of influenza A (H7N9) virus-infected patients have been identified.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are involved in several pathologies such as cardiovascular functions, renal disease, and acute lung injury.\n In the current study, we report that ACE2 could mediate the severe acute lung injury induced by influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in an experimental mouse model.\n Moreover, ACE2 deficiency worsened the disease pathogenesis markedly, mainly by targeting the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1).\n The current findings demonstrate that ACE2 plays a

A case of sudden unexpected death due to COVID-19 is presented as a means of illustrating common autopsy findings, as well as diagnostic and biosafety considerations. We also review and summarize the current COVID-19 literature in an effort to provide practical evidence-based biosafety guidance for medical examiner-coroner offices encountering COVID-19 at autopsy.\nSARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus that was detected as the causative agent of human respiratory infection (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It is related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, other human coronaviruses responsible for outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome first detected in China in 2002-2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively. Based on currently available global data, COVID-19 is thought to cause mild, limited, or no symptoms in at least 80% of those infected. A substantial portion of COVID-infected individuals are suspected to be asymptomatic carriers; estimates derived from select populations of quarantined individuals who underwent widespread testing (eg, cruise ship passengers and Japanese citizens evacuated from China) range from 18% to 33%. Of those known to be COVID-19 positive, approximately 20% to 30% will develop more severe disease necessitating hospitalization. Such disease may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, multiorgan failure, and death. Risk factors for severe disease have been reported to include advanced age, hypertension, and diabetes, although recent data suggest hospitalization may be more common among younger COVID-19 patients than previously suspected.\nCase fatality ratios range widely from 0.2% to 7.7%, depending on the population age, prevalence of comorbidities, testing criteria and availability, health care capacity, and how cases are defined. A variety of electronic databases provide ongoing daily monitoring of COVID-19 cases tabulated by country. Inevitably, there will be an increased number of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 deaths encountered at autopsy. While multiple guidelines have been issued regarding autopsy protocol in cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 deaths, there is some variability in the recommendations. Additionally, limited recommendations to date have been issued regarding scene investigative protocol. We present a case of sudden unexpected death due to COVID-19 as a means of illustrating suggestive autopsy findings, diagnostic considerations, and recommended scene and morgue biosafety practices in novel coronavirus deaths.\nCASE REPORT\nHistory\nA 58-year-old woman reported a week of fevers and respiratory difficulty. Her medical history was significant for insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c; range, 7%-11%), obesity, hyperlipidemia, mild intermittent asthma, and chronic lower extremity swelling with ulceration. She was instructed to stay home and self-quarantine by her retail store employer. She was found dead in her bedroom after last being known alive the night before. Emergency medical services responded to the scene and attempted resuscitation before pronouncing death and notifying the medical examiner's office.\nScene Investigation\nTwo medicolegal death investigators performed a scene investigation. Family members were interviewed outside the residence, eliciting the information that several of the decedent's coworkers and an adult member of her household had also developed respiratory illness symptoms. At least 6 ft (ie, 2 m) of separation was maintained between investigators and family members during interview. Prior to entering the residence, investigators donned personal protective equipment (PPE) sufficient for contact and droplet precautions including gloves, fluid-resistant gown, a barrier face mask, and goggles. A camera was used to document the scene photographically; otherwise, minimal equipment was brought into the residence. Following documentation, the body was examined and placed in a plastic shroud and then sealed in a body bag and loaded into the transport vehicle. After the body was secured, investigators doffed their PPE and performed hand hygiene with an alcohol-based gel. The body was then transported to the morgue and logged in without opening the outer body bag. The transport vehicle was disinfected with a dilute bleach solution.\nAutopsy Protocol\nAn autopsy was performed in a separate negative-pressure isolation suite adjacent to the main morgue room but on its own heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning circuit with 16 air changes per hour. Only 2 operators (ie, a pathologist and a technician) were permitted in the isolation suite during the case. A second technician acted as a circulator and monitored the case via an observation window; communication was facilitated via inexpensive low-power walkie-talkies. A small isolation cooler attached to the isolation room acted as an airlock to facilitate transfer of materials into and out of the isolation suite during the prosection (Fig. 1).\nA and B, Isolation cooler &quot;airlock&quot; entrance from body receiving area (A) and access to the isolation suite (B); note that full PPE required for entry into the airlock.\nIn accordance with guidelines, PPE utilized by autopsy prosectors included scrubs, dedicated autopsy footwear with shoe covers, a long-sleeve water resistant gown or Tyvek suit, a long-sleeved splash apron, double gloves and cut gloves, hair covers, and a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) with full-face shield (Fig. 2). Grossly soiled PPE was frequently wiped down with disinfectant wipes or dilute bleach solution during the procedure. Doffing of PPE at the end of the procedure occurred in the isolation cooler airlock and was monitored by an inspector.\nAutopsy PPE on left with a full face-shield PAPR and liquid impervious gown; scene investigation PPE on right with disposable facemask respirator (shown with N95, but current requirements are for surgical mask only), fluid resistant gown, and eye protection.\nThe autopsy was performed with minor modifications to standard procedures. In order to minimize potential organism aerosolization, the sink-mounted vacuum aspirator, sink drain tissue grinder, and station hose were not used. All fluid collections were ladled from body cavities. Although the head was opened with a powered oscillating saw, the upper half of the body, head of the table, and floor surrounding these areas were misted with disinfectant immediately upon cessation of powered sawing and before brain removal. Only one prosector remained in the room during the sawing; for at least 10 minutes afterward (ie, 2 full air changes), no additional personnel entered the room. Cleaning of the body and autopsy table was accomplished with towels that were subsequently discarded. Limited body and specimen photography was accomplished either in situ or on a small photography board near the body.\nPostautopsy Procedures\nFollowing autopsy, the body was closed in the standard fashion and cleaned with damp towels and disinfectant. A clean body table with a clean body bag and plastic shroud spread out on it had been placed in the isolation cooler airlock by the second technician. This was moved into the isolation suite, and the body was transferred onto the clean shroud, wrapped tightly, sealed with tape, and then zipped into the clean body bag. This procedure allowed the outer surfaces of the shroud and body bag to remain essentially clean. Once sealed, the outer bag was labeled and signed by the pathologist and technician, each verifying the identity of the decedent. The outer surface of the body bag was then sprayed with disinfectant, and the body table was removed to the isolation cooler where residual liquid disinfectant was removed, and the bag labeled as infectious.\nRelease procedures were modified to prevent opening the body bag or shroud for visual identification confirmation by funeral home staff while the body was still in the facility. The dual signatures of the pathologist and technician acted as the confirmation that the body bag contained the correct decedent, and release to the funeral home was performed without opening the outer bag. The infectious nature of the case was disclosed to the funeral home personnel at the time of release. Notably, none of the personnel involved in this index case (ie, pathologist, technicians, scene investigators) suffered any symptoms consistent with COVID infection in the 2 weeks following their involvement in the case nor since.\nGross Findings\nExternal examination revealed an obese (body mass index 38 kg/m2) middle-aged adult woman with fully developed rigor mortis and blanching livor mortis. Changes of lower extremity venous stasis and scarring consistent with the history of lower leg ulcers were present. On internal examination, there were no pleural effusions or other abnormal fluid collections. Thick mucus was noted in the airways, however. The lungs were moderately heavy and edematous (right: 818 g, left: 705 g) and had a relatively firm texture throughout. Areas of hemorrhage were evident in the right upper and middle lobes and to a lesser extent in the left lower lobe (Fig. 3.) Hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes appeared enlarged.\nUnfixed moderately heavy, edematous, and relatively firm lungs with areas of hemorrhage in the right upper/middle lobes and left lower lobe.\nThe heart weighed 438 g and exhibited moderate coronary atherosclerosis in each of the main coronary distributions, but there were no occlusions or critical stenoses. The myocardium was free of obvious infarcts and had the expected firm texture and red-brown color. The left ventricle was 1.2 to 1.4 cm thick. The cardiac valves were normal. There was moderate infrarenal aortic atherosclerosis. The kidneys were finely granular and had focal cortical scars (right 170 g, left 183 g). The spleen had a normal-appearing capsule and parenchyma (148 g). The liver (1990 g) was grossly unremarkable. The brain (1221 g) exhibited hydrocephalus ex vacuo; the frontal horns measured 2.8 cm in greatest dimension at the level of the temporal poles. Tissue sections were placed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and allowed to fix for 72 hours prior to histologic sampling. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed by an outside laboratory.\nMicroscopic Findings\nHistologic examination of the lungs revealed diffuse proteinaceous edema and dense amphophilic concretions along alveolar septae consistent with hyaline membranes. The lung architecture was preserved, and the septae were of normal thickness, but mild mononuclear infiltrates were present throughout. There was prominent desquamating pneumocyte hyperplasia with focal multinucleated cells and bizarre forms. Acute alveolar hemorrhage and collections of reactive foamy alveolar macrophages were focally present, as were collections of alveolar fibrin (Fig. 4.) No viral inclusions or specific cytopathic changes were identified. Suppurative inflammation was absent. No fibroblastic foci, fibrosis, granulomas, or foreign bodies were appreciated.\nA-F, Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections at original magnification of 100x (A, B) and 400x (C-F). Lung parenchyma exhibits inflamed septae, hyaline membranes, and pneumocyte hyperplasia (A); septal and perivascular mononuclear inflammation (B); hyaline membranes and alveolar fibrin (C); intra-alveolar macrophages and reactive pneumocytes (D); marked pneumocyte hyperplasia (E); with sporadic multinucleated cells (F).\nSections of myocardium demonstrated myocyte hypertrophy with interstitial and perivascular fibrous tissue but no acute ischemic changes or inflammatory infiltrates. The liver exhibited mild steatosis and central lobular pallor and congestion, but no significant portal or lobular inflammation. Renal changes included arteriolosclerosis, mesangial sclerosis and hypercellularity, and focal global glomerulosclerosis. A section of medulla had no inflammatory or ischemic changes. An incidental adrenal cortical nodule and a focus of papillary adenocarcinoma of the thyroid were also detected.\nAncillary Testing\nDacron-tipped swabs of the right and left main bronchi were procured, placed into viral transport medium, and submitted to the Washington State Public Health Laboratory for both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza testing. Bacterial swabs of areas of potential consolidation were placed in Amies transport media tubes and submitted to the University of Washington microbiology laboratory for culture. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for SARS-CoV-2 returned as positive 11.5 hours after submission. Negative influenza results returned several days later. Bacterial cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans. Given the lack of acute histologic inflammation in the lungs, these bacterial culture results were interpreted as being most likely contaminants or postmortem artifact.\nDeath Certification\nBased on the above autopsy and investigative findings, and in accordance with US National Vital Statistics certification guidelines, the cause of death was determined to be ARDS due to viral pneumonia due to COVID-19. Other significant contributory factors included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity. The state department of health was notified.\nDISCUSSION\nCurrently every state in the United States has reported COVID-19 cases, resulting in a total of more than 46,000 deaths to date. Inevitably, medical examiner/coroner (ME/C) offices will encounter increased numbers of SARS-CoV-2-infected decedents at autopsy as a result of COVID-19 spread. While in some cases a history of fever and/or respiratory distress (eg, cough or shortness of breath) may suggest the diagnosis, epidemiologic studies indicate that the majority of individuals infected with COVID-19 develop mild to no symptoms. Even those dying with:but not of:COVID-19 may still be infectious. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from presymptomatic/asymptomatic individuals has been documented, although the frequency remains to be established. Medical examiner/coroners must use their judgment to determine whether postmortem COVID-19 testing and/or autopsy should be pursued. In addition to suggestive antemortem signs/symptoms, epidemiologic factors may also help guide decisions such as history of contact with a known COVID-19-positive case, or being a part of a cluster of respiratory illness cases in a closed setting (eg, a nursing care facility). The presented autopsy case and literature review are intended to help familiarize ME/C offices with COVID-19 disease features, diagnostic strategies, and key biosafety principles.\nTransmission\nIt is suspected that SARS-CoV-2:similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV:began as a zoonotic coronavirus that subsequently spread to humans. Community- and health care-associated person-to-person transmission were documented early in the pandemic, and direct or close contact with infectious persons is believed to be the major mode of transmission. Transmission occurs through exposure to infectious droplets originating from the respiratory tract; infectious droplets may be released from an infected individual via sneezing, coughing, talking, or undergoing an aerosolizing procedure such as intubation or autopsy. Reportedly droplets neither typically spread beyond 6 ft (2 m) nor linger in air, although some evidence has suggested a longer range of spread may be possible. Less commonly infection may arise as a result of indirect transmission through fomites, especially if the eyes, face, or mouth are contacted after touching an infected surface. SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in blood and anal swabs; increasing evidence suggests that fecal-oral transmission may be another potential route of spread.\nScene Investigation\nAs in the current presented case, investigators are advised to mitigate risk of potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure at death scenes by standing at a distance of 6 ft or greater when conducting interviews and requesting interviewees to remain outside the residence while investigators enter. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently issued recommendations for the public to wear cloth facial coverings when at risk of social-based transmission, scene investigators may consider encouraging interviewees to don cloth facial masks. Scene investigators should don contact and droplet precaution PPE when entering residences. Decontamination of all potentially contaminated equipment, careful body bagging procedures, and investigator hand hygiene are also encouraged. Anecdotally, this has been the scene investigative policy of the Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office, which despite being the country with the second highest number of positive/confirmed COVID cases in the state of Washington has had no scene investigators who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 to date. In order to more efficiently triage cases, ME/C offices may elect to have scene investigators procure nasopharyngeal (NP) viral testing swabs at the scene. Scene investigative recommendations are summarized in Table 1.\nScene Investigative Recommendations in Suspected/Confirmed COVID-19 Cases\nMorgue and PPE\nEach office is advised to carefully assess its own infrastructure, supplies, and staffing to determine whether suspected or confirmed COVID-19 deaths can be safely prosected on site. Current CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations are that suspected/confirmed COVID-19 autopsies be prosected in an airborne infection isolation rooms at negative pressure relative to surrounding areas and ideally with at least 12 air changes per hour (although 6 will suffice in older structures.) Air from isolation rooms should be exhausted directly outside or else pass through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter if recirculated. Recommended PPE includes standard autopsy protection (ie, double surgical gloves interposed with a layer of cut-proof synthetic mesh gloves, scrub suit worn under an impermeable long-sleeve gown/apron, goggles or face shield, shoe covers, and surgical cap). As autopsy prosection may generate aerosols, respiratory protection consisting of a disposable N95 respirator or PAPR with HEPA filter is also indicated.\nGiven national PPE supply limitations, ME/C offices are encouraged to restrict autopsy attendance to key personnel only (ie, prosector and technician). In order to preserve eyewear, preferential use of powered air purifying respirators or goggles, which can be reused following appropriate disinfection, should be considered. In general, PAPRs are preferable to N95 respirator masks as they provide even higher protection to prosectors and:with appropriate disinfection of reusable elements after use:can be repeatedly used, thus assisting with PPE conservation efforts. Powered air-purifying respirator filters should be replaced in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. Some studies have suggested the possibility of decontaminating and reusing N95 masks via UV germicidal irradiation, hydrogen peroxide vapor sterilization, and simply allowing respirators to hang to dry for 3 days. Proposals for respirator mask construction have also been offered. Further details regarding PPE conservation strategies are beyond the bounds of the current review but are available through the CDC.\nAutopsy Protocol\nAerosol generation at autopsy may occur through inadvertent splashing of fluids, puncturing of fluid pockets under pressure, and using vacuum-assisted suction devices and sink-mounted tissue grinders. However, the most likely aerosol-generating autopsy procedure is use of powered oscillating bone saws, particularly during brain removal. High densities of aerosolized particles are generated in the region of the saw placing the user at risk. While N95 respirator masks physically filter 95% of particles at least 1 mum in size from the inspired air, CDC and OSHA guidelines nonetheless suggest avoiding use of an oscillating bone saw at autopsy in cases of suspected/confirmed COVID-19. If a saw is used, it is recommended that a vacuum shroud be attached to assist in capturing aerosols. Other oscillating saw aerosol reduction techniques to consider include moistening the saw blade before cutting, using autopsy tables with built-in ventilation, tenting plastic around the decedent's neck and head to entrap aerosols, and wearing a HEPA-filtered PAPR rather than N95 mask. As in the current presented case, other general splash and aerosol reduction techniques (eg, eschewing use of vacuum assisted aspirator, sink tissue grinder, or hose) are also advised. Autopsy protocol recommendations are summarized in Table 2.\nAutopsy Recommendations in Suspected/Confirmed COVID-19 Cases\nGross and Histologic Features\nWhile much literature has been published regarding COVID-19 signs/symptoms and clinical course, there is currently a paucity of data regarding expected postmortem gross and histologic findings. The case presented herein adds to those few previously published studies. Lungs are often heavy and histologically reveal edema with focal/diffuse hyaline membrane formation, pneumocyte hyperplasia, patchy mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, some multinucleated cells, and a lack of definitive intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions. Overall, pulmonary pathologic features generally appear consistent with early/organizing diffuse alveolar damage and resemble those seen in SARS autopsies While myocarditis has been reported in association with COVID-19, it appears to be a less common complication. Most typically (as in the presented case), minimal mononuclear myocardial inflammatory involvement is found. Rarely, COVID-19-associated encephalitis has been reported.\nDecontamination\nIn an experimental study, viable SARS-CoV-2 was detected up to 72 hours after being placed onto plastic and stainless-steel surfaces; it also remained viable in an experimentally created aerosol for at least 3 hours, although infectious titers per liter of air decreased over time. A recent review and analysis of literature found that generally human coronaviruses can remain infectious for up to 9 days on inanimate surfaces, depending on surface type and temperature; at temperatures &gt;=30 C (ie, 86 F), viral persistence shortened. Given that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable on a variety of inanimate surfaces for a matter of days, careful morgue decontamination procedures are key. Surface disinfection with diluted household bleach solutions (ie, of 0.1% sodium hypochlorite), 0.5% hydrogen peroxide solutions, or alcohol solutions (ie, with at least 70% ethanol) has been shown to inactivate human coronaviruses within 1 minute. For hospital-grade disinfectants, staff should verify their suitability for use against SARS-CoV-2 and ensure disinfectants remain on surfaces in accordance with US Environmental Protection Agency recommendations. While conclusive data regarding how long infectious human remains may harbor infectious SARS-CoV-2 are lacking, autopsies in cases of SARS found that SARS-CoV could be recovered from lung tissue and grown in cell culture up to 7 days after death. Considering that there is reportedly 75% to 80% similarity between the viral genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent of COVID-19) and SARS-CoV (causative agent of SARS), these results suggest that protective precautions are called for even in cases of delayed suspected COVID-19 death investigations or autopsies. While limited data exist regarding formalin inactivation of SARS-CoV-2-infected tissue, formalin fixation at room temperature has been shown to inactivate most of SARS-CoV (ie, close to assay detection limits) within a day.\nDiagnosis\nIn cases of suspected COVID-19 in which full autopsies are performed, submission of SARS-CoV-2 swabs from both upper and bilateral lower respiratory tracts is recommended by the CDC. If NP and bilateral tracheobronchial/lung swabs are procured, it is recommended they be submitted in separate vials each containing 2 to 3 mL of viral transport medium. Medical examiner/coroner offices, however, must be cognizant of their current state health department testing capacity and proceed accordingly. A rational strategy for minimizing the number of swab submissions per autopsy is to submit swabs only from the lower respiratory tract. Additionally, sampling both lungs with a single swab may increase recovery of viral RNA. Concurrent testing for other causes of respiratory illness such as influenza is also strongly encouraged. In order to preserve limited viral testing kit supply, ME/C offices are encouraged to communicate with their testing laboratories to verify whether COVID-19, as well as other respiratory viral pathogen testing, can be performed on a single swab. Prosectors should submit separate samples for bacterial/fungal organisms as indicated. In cases of suspected COVID-19 in which autopsy is not performed, NP swab testing for COVID-19, as well as other respiratory pathogens, is recommended.\nOnly synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shafts should be submitted for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, as others may inactivate virus or otherwise inhibit the testing. In the event that swabs were not procured at autopsy, fixed autopsy tissue specimens may also be submitted to CDC in suspected COVID-19 deaths for immunohistochemical, molecular, or other assay characterization. Recent diagnostic advancements include the Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization enabling US laboratories already certified for high-complexity testing to develop and validate their own SARS-CoV-2 testing; this markedly augmented diagnostic capability as previously all testing was performed mainly by US public health laboratories. Additionally, there has been emergency use authorization approval of rapid COVID-19 PCR diagnostic tests that some manufacturers report can deliver results in less than an hour. Recently, a serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing to assess for COVID-19 antibodies has received Food and Drug Administration approval, and more are in development; these are expected to prove of utility in more accurately calculating disease transmission and mortality rates.\nCase Triage\nPrevious surveys have indicated that morgues are heterogeneous in their preparedness to handle highly infectious disease cases. Facility environmental controls, availability of PPE, and staffing are all factors that ME/C must carefully assess in determining whether suspected/confirmed COVID-19 deaths will be autopsied. The majority of known COVID-19 deaths technically should not fall under ME/C office jurisdiction as they are natural deaths predominantly occurring in hospitalized patients. While autopsy is unlikely to be necessary in such cases:and is, in fact, discouraged by OSHA:ME/C may nonetheless be called upon to facilitate death certification ensuring accurate public health disease tracking, or in cases of medicolegal significance (homicides, accidents or suicides) where a decedent dies in the hospital and is COVID-19 positive due to community spread.\nIn deaths occurring outside the hospital setting, ME/C offices are tasked with determining whether deaths are attributable to COVID-19 and performing autopsies as needed. Medical examiner/coroner offices may elect to triage cases by taking viral NP swabs in suspected COVID-19 deaths and reserve autopsy for those decedents with negative testing results or else cases in which SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to be incidental rather than the cause of death. Performing an NP swab for SARS-CoV-2 requires neither a negative-pressure room nor N95 respirator; basic contact and droplet precaution PPE are sufficient. In cases in which autopsy is merited, the above described precautions should be followed to prevent morgue staff-acquired COVID-19 infection. Some offices have elected to perform limited autopsies (eg, precluding brain/spinal cord removal) in cases of suspected/known COVID-19 positivity to reduce morgue staff aerosol exposure. Others have incorporated antemortem or postmortem CT radiology as a means of helping triage decedents meriting testing and/or autopsy. Establishing collaborative relations with larger ME/C offices capable of safely autopsying suspected highly infectious disease cases should be encouraged. Globally, mobile biosafety autopsy facilities/laboratories with sophisticated infrastructure have been deployed during disease epidemics such as SARS and Ebola virus; advantages include the ability to mobilize rapidly to areas of need with minimal footprint. Such mobile facilities may be advisable in the United States as well.\nBody Disposition\nNeither CDC nor WHO guidelines require double-bagging of known COVID-19-positive decedents; however, ME/C offices should ensure that any body fluids leaking from orifices are contained. Utilizing cotton packing of orifices, a plastic shroud, or a second body bag is a potential method of preventing fluid leakage. Following appropriate decontamination of the body bag, a method of clearly designating the infectious nature of contents to funeral home personnel should be used (eg, body bag notification sticker); ME/C offices may want to consider modifying body release procedures to preclude contamination risks of opening body bag in morgue for funeral personnel identification. There is currently no CDC nor WHO requirement for cremation of COVID-19-positive decedents. While decedents can be buried or cremated as per current state requirements, burial may result in storage difficulties as social distancing-related funeral service delays. Further details of recommended funeral home/mortuary protocol in cases of COVID-19-positive decedents can be accessed on both the CDC and the National Funeral Directors Association websites. Medical examiner/coroner offices are encouraged to closely collaborate with funeral homes/mortuaries to ensure body transportation and storage needs are met. In jurisdictions with a required waiting period prior to cremation (eg, 48 hours), investigating the possibility of a waiver in order to alleviate decedent storage issues may be advisable.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough much remains to be learned about SARS-CoV-2, recommendations for handling decedents with known or suspected COVID-19 are available from multiple national and international organizations. Additionally, much can be inferred from experiences with prior coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In order to ensure safety of scene investigators, ME/Cs, and morgue staff, developing an understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, presentation, and prevention strategies is key. The current case presentation with literature review is intended to better inform and provide practical evidence-based biosafety guidance for ME/C offices encountering COVID-19 at autopsy. As community spread of COVID-19 increases, ME/C offices are encouraged to employ these biosafety principles broadly, as COVID carriers may be presymptomatic or asymptomatic, and yet still present infectious risk at autopsy. Medical examiner/coroner offices are cautioned that suspicious scene investigative history (eg, nursing home resident or individual from homeless encampment) cannot necessarily be relied upon to identify COVID carriers. It is hoped that by documenting and sharing postmortem findings ME/C offices can provide new insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially assist in formulating therapeutic strategies to reduce disease mortality.\nThe authors report no conflict of interest.\nREFERENCES\nGenomic characterization and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding\nCharacteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: summary of a report of 72 314 cases from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention [published online February 24, 2020]\nReport of the WHO-China joint mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·031·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·6112·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·024·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to ?-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host.\n The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract.\n Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe.\n The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm.\n Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.\n In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and

to standardize the amount of tissue tested.\n SARS?CoV viral load and SARS?CoV/GAPDH RNA ratio for each organ type were related to four time durations: onset of illness to death, death to post?mortem

durations.\n The ratio reached the highest value of equal to or greater than one for lung and small bowel, whereas those for heart, liver, spleen, and kidney were always less than one.\n It is

Nucleoprotein and RNA in Lungs from Fatal Cases of SARS","abstract":"Background\nCellular localization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the lungs of patients with SARS is important in confirming the etiological association of the virus with disease as well as in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\n To our knowledge, there have been no comprehensive studies investigating viral infection at the cellular level in humans.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nWe collected the largest series of fatal cases of SARS with autopsy material to date by merging the pathological material from two regions involved in the 2003 worldwide SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, China, and Toronto, Canada.\n\n We developed a monoclonal antibody against the SARS-CoV nucleoprotein and used it together with in situ hybridization (ISH) to analyze the autopsy lung tissues of 32 patients with SARS from Hong Kong and Toronto.\n\n We compared the results of these assays with the pulmonary pathologies and the clinical course of illness for each patient.\n\n SARS-CoV nucleoprotein and RNA were detected by immunohistochemistry and ISH, respectively, primarily in alveolar pneumocytes and, less frequently, in macrophages.\n\n Such localization was detected in four of the seven patients who died within two weeks of illness onset, and in none of the 25 patients who died later than two weeks after symptom onset.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe pulmonary alveolar epithelium is the chief target of SARS-CoV, with macrophages infected subsequently.\n\n Viral replication appears to be limited to the first two weeks after symptom onset, with little evidence of continued widespread replication after this period.\n\n If antiviral therapy is considered for future treatment, it should be focused on this two-week period of acute clinical disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1324951","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"John

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The

international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","abstract":"Background\nSince Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak.\n\n Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 2324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·472·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·87·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227805), 113 (57193), 98 (49168), 111 (56191), and 80 (40139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 12 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Features and Treatment of 2019-nCov Pneumonia Patients in Wuhan: Report of A Couple Cases","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS-CoV-2 viral load in upper respiratory specimens of infected patients","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2:Singapore, January 23-March 16, 2020 [published online April 1, 2020]","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1093/cid/ciaa316","date":"2020-03-20","title":"COVID-19 Transmission Within a Family Cluster by Presymptomatic Carriers in China","abstract":"We report a family cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a presymptomatic case.\n There were 9 family members, including 8 laboratory-confirmed with COVID-19, and a 6-year-old child had no evidence of infection.\n Among the 8 patients, 1 adult and a 13-month-old infant were asymptomatic, and 1 adult was diagnosed as having severe pneumonia.\n","id":"PMC7184331","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Naibin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Naibin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ada Hoi Yan","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liping","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guoxiang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xueqin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaomin","surname":"Chen","email":"chxmin@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid2606.200357","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Serial Interval of COVID-19 among Publicly Reported Confirmed Cases","abstract":"We estimate the distribution of serial intervals for 468 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease reported in China as of February 8, 2020.

events that yield both easily visible droplets and large quantities of particles too small to see by eye.\n Nonetheless, it has long been known that normal speech also yields large quantities of particles that are too small to see by eye, but are large enough to carry a variety of communicable respiratory pathogens.\n Here we show that the rate of particle emission during normal human speech is positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude) of vocalization, ranging from approximately 1 to 50 particles per second (0.06 to 3 particles per cm3) for low to high amplitudes, regardless of the language spoken (English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic).\n Furthermore, a small fraction of individuals behaves as speech superemitters, consistently releasing an order of magnitude more particles than their peers.\n Our data demonstrate that the phenomenon of speech superemission cannot be fully explained either by the phonic structures or the amplitude of the speech.\n These results suggest that other unknown physiological factors, varying dramatically among individuals, could affect the probability of respiratory infectious disease transmission, and also help explain the existence of superspreaders who are disproportionately responsible for outbreaks of airborne infectious disease.\n","id":"PMC6382806","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing

Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel CoronavirusInfected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese

Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but gained little information on the organ distribution of SARS?associated coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS?CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS?CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS?CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS.\n SARS?CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle.\n These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS?CoV may also be targets of SARS?CoV infection.\n The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS?CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection.\n In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS?CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission.\n This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS?CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways.\n This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS.\n Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

epidemiologists, microbiologists, infection control, and critical-care doctors from the European member states, who are experienced in the management of patients with highly infectious diseases.\n We aim to develop a consensus recommendation for infection control during clinical management and invasive procedures in such patients.\n After an extensive literature review, draft recommendations were amended jointly by 27 partners from 15 European countries.\n Recommendations include repetitive training of staff to ascertain infection control, systematic use of cough and respiratory etiquette at admission to the emergency department, fluid sampling in the isolation room, and analyses in biosafety level 3/4 laboratories, and preference for point-of-care bedside laboratory tests.\n Children should be cared for by paediatricians and intensive-care patients should be cared for by critical-care doctors in high-level isolation units (HLIU).\n Invasive procedures should be avoided if unnecessary or done in the HLIU, as should chest radiography, ultrasonography, and renal dialysis.\n Procedures that require transport of patients out of the HLIU should be done during designated sessions or hours in secure transport.\n Picture archiving and communication systems should be used.\n Post-mortem examination should be avoided; biopsy or blood collection is preferred.\n","id":"PMC7106353","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

COVID-19, caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), subsequently spread to&gt; 205 countries and territories, with a current count of&gt; 2.5 million cases and&gt; 170 000 deaths worldwide. 6  Clinical data suggest that SARS, MERS and COVID-19 manifest with similar respiratory symptoms of varying severity.\nSince the outbreak, healthcare professionals and researchers have been working together to decipher the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Although the latest literature provides insights into clinical manifestations, 7  published histopathology and autopsy findings currently remain scarce. 8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13  \nSeveral studies presenting postmortem findings of SARS patients have been published, but only few of them incorporated whole body autopsies. 14 ,  15  Although SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was detected in many organ systems, the primary finding associated with the cause of death was respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Bronchopneumonia was also a common finding, especially in patients with longer disease duration, who then also showed signs of organising pneumonia. 16 ,  17  In some cases, secondary lymphoid organs showed profound lymphoid depletion and disruption of architecture, indicating a complex pathophysiology beyond the respiratory system. Instead, like other generalised viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection, SARS affects the immune system, purportedly leading to generalised immune system dysfunction. 18  This might be a major difference between infections caused by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the latter being more contagious but less virulent. 19  \nAutopsy studies on MERS are limited; according to our knowledge, there is currently only one complete autopsy case study described in the literature. 20  A 45-year-old previously healthy male with typical clinical manifestations of MERS died 8 days after first hospital admission. Similarly to what is seen with SARS, major histomorphological findings included exudative DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, single syncytial cells, and interstitial septal lymphoid infiltrates. The trachea and bronchi also showed lymphoid infiltrates. The kidneys and the heart predominantly showed changes related to hypertension. The spleen and lymph nodes showed an increase in immunoblasts and reactive changes, whereas left-shifted myelopoiesis was seen in the bone marrow. Ancillary studies using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy revealed the exclusive presence of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the lungs and submucosal bronchial glands, and confirmed dipeptidyl peptidase 4, a cell surface receptor, as a point of entry for MERS-CoV. This led to the conclusion that the pathological findings in other organs were probably attributable to secondary causes (due to previous steroid medication) and sequelae of shock. A postmortem investigation of core needle biopsies yielded similar results but did show viral particles in the kidneys. 21  \nOwing to our comparatively high autopsy rate (~20% of hospital deaths in the last decade), we have the opportunity to rely on a well-equipped and experienced team for autopsy-related investigations. Our study summarises the findings of a comprehensively analysed autopsy cohort of 21 patients from two Swiss hospitals in order to provide an overview of organ pathologies related to COVID-19.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy Cohort\nAll autopsies were performed at the Institute of Pathology at the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland (n = 11) and the Institute of Pathology at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland (n = 10). In most cases, full body autopsy was performed (n = 17). Partial autopsy of the upper respiratory tract, lungs and heart was carried out in some cases, owing to the wishes of patients or relatives, or excessive obesity. Clinical features, including comorbidities, radiological findings, and medication history, are shown in Table 1 and Table S1. The mean postmortem interval from death to autopsy was 33.3 h (11-84.5 h).

Autopsies were performed in a room with adequate airflow (more than six air changes per hour of total room volume) under conditions similar to those recommended for autopsies of those who have died from suspected Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (i.e. hazmat suits, boots, goggles, and FFP2/3 masks) with an in-corpore technique analogous to that used in forensic institutions. Thoracic organs were eviscerated (see below), and the heart was separately dissected in the direction of blood flow. Parenchymal organs (liver, spleen, kidney, and pancreas) were dissected within the body. After mobilisation of the small and large intestines, their exterior surfaces were inspected; if there were any outstanding findings, tissue was excised for further macroscopic and histological examination. In all cases, tissue samples from the liver, heart and kidney were histologically examined. Other organs, as well as bone marrow and the brain, were analysed upon specific clinical indication (younger age; neurological symptoms). To avoid aerosolisation, the brain was removed by opening the skull with a handsaw; bone marrow from the iliac crest was also procured with a handsaw. A detailed description of this in-corpore protocol is provided in Doc. S1.\nThe lungs, trachea and larynx were exenterated intact and perfused via the trachea with 4% refrigerated (4 C) phosphate-buffered formalin. The trachea was then closed with a clamp, and the specimens immersed in formalin at room temperature for 72 h before dissection. The lungs were subsequently cut into 5-10-mm parasagittal slices and examined macroscopically. Two sections of each lobe, as well as the trachea, were submitted for histological examination.\nAncillary Techniques\nTissue samples were processed with standard histochemical methods, i.e. haematoxylin and eosin staining (all organs), chromotrope aniline blue staining (heart and liver), Giemsa staining (bone marrow), and periodic acid-Schiff reaction (bone marrow, kidney, and spleen). Additional stains [Congo red, Prussian blue and rhodamine (copper), Gram, Brown-Brenn and/or Grocott methenamine silver stain] were used when necessary.\nImmunohistochemical examinations were performed for fibrin, amyloid transthyretin (ATTR), CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, multiple myeloma 1 and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) as previously described. 23 ,  24 ,  25  \nIn all cases, the postmortem viral load was measured in lungs and other selected organs by means of a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was extracted with the RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Viral genomes were detected with the TaqMan 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which targets three different viral genomic regions (ORFab1, S protein, and N protein) and the human RNase P gene (RPPH1). The number of viral genomes was determined with the TaqMan 2019-nCoV Control Kit v1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a comparative C t (DeltaDeltaC t) method. The method generates individual copy numbers for human RPPH1 and the three SARS-CoV-2 targets. Mean copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 targets were scaled to 1 x 106 RPPH1 copies.\nElectron microscopy was performed on two lung and kidney specimens according to standard institute protocols. Tissue was fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde and examined by use of a transmission electron microscope (Morgagni 268D; FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA).\nResults\nClinical Characteristics\nOur patient cohort had a male/female ratio of 17:4 (i.e. 81% males), and a mean age of 76 years (53-96 years). All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by use of an antemortem polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 performed on a nasopharyngeal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or sputum (median of 7.15 days before death; range, 0-20 days). Most commonly, patients presented with dry cough and fever (n = 16 and n = 12, respectively). The mean hospitalisation time before death was 5.7 days (range, 0-16 days). One patient died in the emergency room prior to admission to the ward. Six patients had been intubated.\nAll patients suffered from comorbidities, with hypertension and (pre-)obesity being most common. Fourteen patients (67%) had a history of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-modulating drug intake. Two patients had been treated with immunosuppressive drugs before contracting COVID-19, and one suffered from acquired immunodeficiency. In this cohort, 65% had blood group A:although the population incidence in Switzerland is 45%, 26  this discrepancy did not reach statistical significance.\nClinical characteristics, symptoms and radiological and laboratory findings are summarised in Table 1. Detailed information is given in Table S1.\nLung and Upper Airway Findings\nOne-third of patients presented with severe mucous tracheitis/tracheobronchitis. Gross findings in the lungs were heterogeneous (Figure 1A,B), ranging from patchy to diffuse areas of consolidation to severe and extensive suppurative bronchopneumonic infiltrates. In all cases, the lung parenchyma was heavy and firm, and unevenly bluish-red in colour, with signs of severe congestion. The most prominent histological finding was severe capillary congestion (capillarostasis) accompanied by hyaline membranes, reactive pneumocyte changes and syncytial cells corresponding to exudative DAD (Figure 2A). Eight cases showed proliferative DAD (38%). In 10 cases, superimposed bronchopneumonia with both a focal and a diffuse (n = 6) distribution was seen. On immunohistochemistry, syncytial cells were shown to be of pneumocytic origin (expression of TTF1; Figure 2B). Most lungs showed a paucity of interstitial leucocytes, especially lymphocytes, whereas three showed a moderate lymphoid inflammatory infiltrate; in one of these three cases, no viral RNA was detectable in the lungs as determined by postmortem PCR. Three cases showed severe and extensive bronchopneumonia without typical features of DAD; however, in areas without pneumonia, severe capillarostasis was consistently noted (Figure 2C). Other lung pathologies included oedema and alveolar haemorrhage in conjunction with pulmonary embolism. One case, additionally suffering from bronchopneumonia, showed focal vasculitis and capillaritis with a predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate. In five of 11 cases in which immunohistochemistry for fibrin was performed, microthrombi were detected in alveolar capillaries (Figure 2D). Four cases showed peripheral and prominent central pulmonary embolism. Table 2 summarises the most important autopsy findings. Detailed autopsy findings for each patient are shown in Table S2. Scanned slides of each patient showing representative findings in the lungs, heart and kidney, as well as other relevant organs, are available in Doc. S2.\nGross lung findings.

Unfortunately, subcellular structures could not be analysed, owing to autolysis. However, fibrin precipitates were detected within alveolar capillaries in both cases.\nCardiovascular System Findings\nMyocardial hypertrophy was a common finding (71%), correlating with the high prevalence of hypertension in this cohort. There was one case with acute myocardial infarction. Peracute focal necrosis of cardiomyocytes as a sequela of shock was seen in three patients. Six patients aged 76-96 years were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry for ATTR upon autopsy. Three of these cases showed amyloid deposits in pulmonary vessels. The prevalence of senile amyloidosis in our cohort achieved statistical significance when compared with age-matched autopsies performed at our institute in 2018-2019 (six of 21 versus 22 of 345 autopsies, P = 0.000137, Mann-Whitney U-test). Severe generalised atherosclerosis, defined by the presence of ulcerated plaques of the aorta, was present in 70% of cases.\nKidney Findings\nOn gross examination, renal signs of shock were seen in most autopsies. Histologically, these findings correspond to diffuse acute tubular injury with widened tubular lumina, flattened tubular epithelium, and interstitial oedema (Figure 3A). Three of 18 patients showed signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, with small fibrin thrombi in glomerular capillaries (Figure 3B). One of these cases also presented with an anaemic infarct. Thrombi in other vessels or vasculitic changes were not seen. A focal and sparse chronic inflammatory infiltrate was present in a few cases in areas with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Pre-existing chronic changes, such as arteriolosclerosis, intimal fibrosis of arteries, and vascular scarring related to hypertension and/or ageing, were present in the majority of cases. These findings were particularly prominent in the four patients with known chronic kidney disease of either diabetic or hypertensive aetiology.\nFindings in other organs. A, Kidney showing acute tubular damage without evidence of increased inflammatory infiltrates [periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain]. B, Kidney showing disseminated intravascular coagulation (PAS). C, Florid splenitis showing increases in neutrophil numbers in the perifollicular and marginal zones of the spleen (PAS). D, Lymph node showing an increase in the number of plasmablasts in the interfollicular zone as well as congestion (haematoxylin and eosin). Insert: immunohistochemistry for multiple myeloma 1.\nTransmission electron microscopy was performed on two cases with a short (&lt;12 h) postmortem period. In both cases, we observed prominent activation of podocytes, endothelial cells and proximal tubular epithelial cells. The cytoplasm of podocytes contained multiple vesicles, some with attached ribosomes and double membranes. Occasionally, virus-like particles (7-110 nm) with electron-dense granules were detected within these vesicles (Figure 4A,B). Sporadically, these particles were present in endothelial cells (Figure 4C) and proximal tubular epithelial cells (Figure 4D).\nElectron microscopy findings. A,B, Podocyte cytoplasm with its foot processes on top of a glomerular basement membrane containing mitochondria (upper left corner) and multiple vesicles, two of which contain several small possible virus-like particles with sizes between 70 nm and 110 nm (arrow). At higher magnification, the vesicles contain double membranes and the virus-like particles show a ring of electron-dense granules and a ragged outer contour (electron microscopy). C, An activated glomerular endothelial cell, and a vesicle close to the luminal border with virus-like particles (arrow and insert), adjacent to an erythrocyte (electron-dense structure at the top left) (electron microscopy). D, Cytoplasm of a proximal tubular epithelial cell on top of a basement membrane and adjacent collagen fibres (left side). The cytoplasm contains mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and multiple vesicles, one of which contains virus-like particles (arrow and insert, electron microscopy).\nShock Sequelae and Findings in Other Organs\nSigns of shock constituted a common finding, predominantly affecting the liver and adrenal gland.\nAmong bone marrow samples, three of four showed reactive left-shifted myelopoiesis and one case showed prominent hyperplasia of cytotoxic CD8-positive T cells. In cases with bronchopneumonia, acute splenitis and/or septic neutrophilic leucocytosis of the red pulp was seen (Figure 3C). Perihilar and paratracheal lymph nodes showed prominent congestion and sinus dilatation, as well as an increase in the number of reactive plasmablasts (Figure 3D), consistent with an activated immune response. Extensive depletion of lymphoid cells as described in SARS was not seen.\nMicroscopic analysis of the brain revealed no inflammatory infiltrates or neuronal necrosis. Three of four brains examined showed mild hypoxic injury.\nDetection of the Virus According to PCR and Central Nervous System Findings\nIn all but one patient (see above), mean 125 000 (range 16 865-749 402) viral copies/1 x 106 RPPH1 copies were detected in lung tissue by the use of SARS-CoV2-specific RT-qPCR. In other organs (brain, heart, testicle, and kidney), variable, predominantly low, RNA copy numbers were detected. In the brain, copy numbers were generally low, although values in the olfactory bulb were higher than those in the brainstem.\nDiscussion\nOur study presents a comprehensively analysed autopsy series of predominantly Caucasian COVID-19 patients. To the best of our knowledge, this cohort is larger than any autopsy cohort of COVID-19, SARS or MERS patients reported so far. In general, our cohort was older (average age 76 years) than previously published SARS and MERS autopsy collectives. Morphological manifestations in the lungs and other organ systems in COVID-19 patients were not as extensive and severe as in both SARS and MERS patients. 16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21  This fits with epidemiological studies comparing different types of coronavirus. 19  Comorbidities in our cohort correspond with clinical observational studies. 27 ,  28  Other interesting characteristics of our group included a striking predominance of males and a higher incidence of blood group A.\nTo minimise autolysis, bodies were promptly stored at 4 C after death, and the period between death and autopsy was kept as short as possible (median of 32.9 h). By applying an in-corpore autopsy technique and performing formalin fixation of thoracic organs, we strove to optimise staff safety while taking recently published recommendations into account. 22  None of the staff members involved in this study developed COVID-19.\nSimilarly to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the cytoplasm and is assembled within vesicles prior to its release without evoking typical viropathic changes. 29 ,  30  The upper respiratory tract and lungs serve as the predominant sites of entry and replication, 31  but other replication sites, such as endothelial cells 32  and the kidney, have been suggested. 33 ,  34  As expected, major morphological findings pertaining to the cause of death of our cohort were localised in the respiratory tract. 7  There was some discrepancy from the clinical diagnoses, as cases clinically diagnosed as 'pneumonia, COVID-related' only showed signs of DAD and showed no signs of suppurative bronchopneumonia, both macroscopically and histologically. Direct correlation with radiology findings was not possible, as most cases had only undergone computed tomography imaging at the time of hospital admission, and not in the course of their stay. The predominant histopathological findings in the lungs were capillary congestion, microthrombi, and, in 48% of cases, moderate intra-alveolar fibrin exudation corresponding to exudative DAD and superimposed bronchopneumonia. We considered bronchopneumonia, both in an acute and in an organising state, to be the result of bacterial superinfection, and not a direct result of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung tissue damage. Similarly to what is seen in SARS 14 ,  15  and MERS 20  patients, syncytial cells originating from type II pneumocytes were observed and there was a paucity of inflammatory infiltrates:especially lymphoid cells:in cases without concomitant bronchopneumonia. DAD was less pronounced in the patients with microthrombi, as also shown by Magro et al., 13  and, additionally, four patients developed acute pulmonary embolism. Although the presence of microthrombi can be a feature of DAD, we deduce from the former that these findings may, rather, represent a histological correlate of coagulopathies described in COVID-19 patients. 35  They corroborate the above-mentioned observation and are consistent with complement-mediated microvascular injury in the lung and/or skin. 13  One patient with superimposed bronchopneumonia showed florid vasculitis of small veins and capillaritis, which has previously been described in individual SARS cases. 14 ,  15  However, vasculitic changes of other organs or clinical findings related to systemic vasculitis were not seen, implying that the vasculitic changes could have developed in conjunction with severe bronchopneumonia, in contrast to a study that detected systemic vasculitis in COVID-19 patients. 32  \nA novel and unexpected finding of our study linking a fatal COVID-19 disease course with vascular dysfunction 36  was a high incidence of ATTR amyloidosis (n = 6/21; all diagnosed at autopsy), which was more than four times more prevalent than in non-COVID-19 autopsies conducted at our institutes during previous years. In line with this and with cumulating epidemiological evidence, hypertensive, elderly, overweight and male patients, who are particularly known for their hypercoagulability, 37  were overly represented in our cohort.\nOur series contains a high number of patients who concomitantly presented with acute-onset or acute-on-chronic-onset renal failure (12 of 18 patients at admission; 14 of 18 during the disease course), corroborating previously reported observations of a poorer outcome among this patient group. 38  In all cases with clinical evidence of kidney failure, acute tubular injury was the main histological finding, in line with a recently published report. 33  However, this histological finding is unspecific, and multiple aetiologies relate to it. Three of 18 cases investigated contained microthrombi in glomerular capillaries, which are typically observed in the context of disseminated intravascular coagulation and are usually attributable to generalised shock. However, renal SARS-CoV-2 replication could potentially have contributed to the acute kidney injury in our cohort. The following observations support this hypothesis: (i) high amounts of viral RNA were detected in kidney samples; (ii) the two samples studied with transmission electron microscopy showed virus-like particles in podocytes, glomerular endothelial cells, and especially in proximal tubular epithelial cells; and (iii) some of the patients developed microthrombi in spite of timely anticoagulation. In contrast to the study mentioned above, 33  we detected virus-like particles within vesicles and not in the cytoplasm, consistent with the coronavirus replication cycle and ultrastructural studies of infected cell cultures. 29 ,  30  \nA higher incidence of blood group A among COVID-19 patients in a large population study from China 39  correlates with the incidence in our cohort. Evidence suggests that blood group A may be associated with the failure of the pulmonary microcirculation and coagulopathies in COVID-19 patients. 35  ABO alleles genetically determine/increase von Willebrand factor (VWF) activity by  20%. 40  Individuals with the A1A1 genotype in particular show the highest blood group antigen loading of VWF, 41  thus leading to higher risk and severity (odds ratio 2.6) of thrombosis in the venous system. 42 ,  43  Moreover, evidence from previous investigations of SARS-CoV suggests a direct interaction between blood group antigen A and the viral S protein, thus facilitating virus entry via angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, 44  which was postulated to have a direct effect on the number of infected individuals and disease kinetics in SARS.\nTwo-thirds of our cases presented with a history of antihypertensive therapy intake directly or indirectly affecting the RAAS, such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) or aldosterone antagonists. These agents are among the antihypertensive drugs most frequently used in Switzerland. Previous studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 utilises ACE2 as a receptor for viral cell entry. 45  As ACE2 is up-regulated upon the administration of antihypertensive therapy affecting the RAAS, these agents might increase the susceptibility to viral invasion, thus increasing the risk of severe and lethal disease outcomes. 46  However, other experimental evidence has shown a protective effect of RAAS inhibition in COVID-19 patients, 47  and, in a recent retrospective clinical study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was associated with lower overall mortality among hospitalised COVID-19 patients with hypertension. 48  \nAll of the points above and a recent autopsy observation of endothelial damage in the kidneys and intestines in COVID-19 patients 32  thus strongly suggest the importance of virus-induced vascular dysfunction in disease progression. Notably, suppressing a COVID-19-associated 'cytokine storm' 49  with anti-interleukin-6 therapy is now a pivotal part of COVID-19 treatment. 50  Current investigations are focusing on the complement system 13  and its role in endothelial dysfunction and coagulopathy; eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against complement protein C5, 51  has shown promise in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV animal models, 52  and its efficacy is currently being investigated in a clinical trial. 53  Given the evidence of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, the efficacy of therapeutic measures such as plasma infusion and exchange and beyond may be considered. 54  \nSeveral investigations have suggested neuronal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, ranging from smell and taste dysfunction to central dysregulation of breathing. 55  In our series, four brains were analysed histologically, and no inflammatory infiltrates or neuronal necroses were observed. Interestingly, although the viral load was low in all samples, it was slightly higher in the olfactory bulb than in the brainstem, supporting the hypothesis of viral entry into the brain via the lamina cribrosa.\nIn summary, our findings provide an insight into the complexity of COVID-19 pathophysiology. SARS-CoV-2 substantially contributed to fatality in all cases, but we postulate a multifactorial cause of death, with COVID-19 as a contributory factor in multimorbid patients. Major findings that imply an impaired microcirculation include pulmonary capillarostasis and the presence of microthrombi in the lungs and kidneys despite anticoagulation. Our findings corroborate clinical and epidemiological data on cardiovascular morbidity and disease outcome, 56 ,  57 ,  58  and add ATTR amyloidosis as a risk factor, thus demonstrating the value of performing autopsies on patients with this emergent disease.\nConflicts of interest\nAll authors declare that they have no conflicting interests.\nAuthor contributions\nThe study was designed by T.

Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),

rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in

coronavirus (SARS?CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS.\n Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004

Pathologic examinations revealed that apart from the tumors, the lungs of both patients exhibited edema, proteinaceous exudate, focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration, and multinucleated giant cells.\n Hyaline membranes were not prominent.\n Because both patients did not exhibit symptoms of pneumonia at the time of operation, these changes likely represent an early phase of the lung pathology of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n","id":"PMC7128866","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

family Coronaviridae.\n To evaluate the lung pathology in this life-threatening respiratory illness, we studied postmortem lung sections from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak.\n The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage.\n The histology varied according to the duration of illness.\n Cases of 10 or fewer days duration demonstrated acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin.\n Cases of more than 10 days duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia.\n In acute-phase DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes.\n Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and CD68 staining.\n SARS-CoV RNA was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue, including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue.\n Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies.\n Further studies of the pathogenesis of SARS may reveal

in the 2003 Toronto outbreak.\n Autopsy material from the lungs of 20 patients who died between March and July 2003 were characterized by histology, molecular biology, and immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins, thyroid transcription factor-1, CD68, EpsteinBarr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes simplex viruses.\n Matched controls were obtained from patients who died of other causes over the same interval.\n The mean duration of illness was 27 days (range 5108 days).\n Post-mortem lung tissues from 19 of 20 patients with probable SARS were positive for SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR.\n Histologically, all patients showed varying degrees of exudative and proliferative phase acute lung injury, evidenced in conventional and immunohistochemical stains by edema, inflammatory infiltrate, pneumocyte hyperplasia, fibrinous exudates, and organization.\n Eight of 20 patients showed predominantly a diffuse alveolar damage pattern of acute lung injury, six showed predominantly an acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia pattern, and the remainder showed an admixture of the two patterns.\n Squamous metaplasia and scattered multinucleate giant cells were present in most cases.\n Vascular fibrin thrombi were a common finding and were often associated with pulmonary infarcts.\n Special stains demonstrated vascular endothelial damage of both small- and mid-sized pulmonary vessels.\n Two cases were complicated by invasive fungal disease consistent with Aspergillosis, and another by coinfection with cytomegalovirus.\n Our findings indicate that the lungs of patients who die of SARS are almost always positive for the SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR, and may show features of both diffuse alveolar damage and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia patterns of acute injury.\n Cases of SARS may be complicated by coexistent infections and therapy-related lung injury.\n","id":"PMC7100506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"United

papulosis","abstract":"Background\nDegos disease is a frequently fatal and incurable occlusive vasculopathy most commonly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract and brain.\n\n Vascular C5b-9 deposition and a type I interferon (IFN) rich microenvironment are held to be pathogenetically important in the evolution of the vascular changes.\n\n We recently discovered the use of eculizumab as a salvage drug in the treatment of near fatal Malignant atrophic papulosis (MAP).\n\n The effects of eculizumab on the pathology of MAP are explored.\n\n\nMethods\nArchival skin and gastrointestinal biopsy material was procured over a 2.5-year period before and after eculizumab therapy in our index case.\n\n Routine light microscopy and immunohistochemical assessment for C3d, C4d, C5b-9, MxA and caspase 3 were examined.\n\n Direct immunofluorescent studies were also conducted on select biopsy material.\n\n\nResults\nThe patient had received eculizumab as a emergent life saving measure and following rapid improvement he continued with biweekly infusions for 4 years.\n\n Although improved he continues to have signs and symptoms of persistent abdominal disease.\n\n Pre-Eculizumab biopsies showed an active thrombotic microangiopathy associated with a high type I interferon signature and extensive vascular deposits of C5b-9 in skin and gastrointestinal biopsies.\n\n Endothelial cell apoptosis as revealed by Caspase 3 expression was noted.\n\n Inflammation comprising lymphocytes and macrophages along with mesenchymal mucin was observed as well.\n\n Post-eculizumab biopsies did not show active luminal thrombosis but only chronic sequelae of prior episodes of vascular injury.\n\n There was no discernible caspase 3 expression.\n\n After 12 months of therapy, C5b-9 was no longer detectable in tissue.\n\n The high type I IFN signature and inflammation along with mucin deposition was not altered by the drug.\n\n In addition, there was little effect of the drug on the occlusive fibrointimal arteriopathy which appears to be one characterized by extensive myofibroblastic expansion of the intima potentially as revealed by staining for smooth muscle actin without immunoreactivity for desmin and myogenin.\n\n\nConclusions\nComplement activation and enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis play an important role in the thrombotic complications of MAP.\n\n However, the larger vessel proliferative intimal changes appear to be independent of complement activation and may be on the basis of other upstream mechanisms.\n\n Monitoring C5b-9 deposition in tissue is likely not of great value in assessing treatment response to eculizumab given the persistence of C5b-9 in tissue for several months despite clinically effective C5 blocking therapy.\n\n A more integrated approach addressing upstream and downstream pathways in addition to those attributable to complement activation are critical for the successful treatment of MAP.\n\n Eculizumab may be used as salvage therapy in critically ill patients with thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\n \n","id":"PMC3879088","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

plasma cells in alveoli, hyaline membrane formation, and viral inclusion bodies in alveolar epithelial cells.\n There was also massive necrosis of splenic lymphoid tissue and localized necrosis in lymph nodes.\n Systemic vasculitis included oedema, localized fibrinoid necrosis, and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and the stroma of striated muscles.\n Thrombosis was present in small veins.\n Systemic toxic changes included degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in the lung, liver,

from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak.\n The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage.\n The histology varied according to the duration of illness.\n Cases of 10 or fewer days duration demonstrated acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin.\n Cases of more than 10 days duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia.\n In acute-phase DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes.\n Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and CD68 staining.\n SARS-CoV RNA was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue, including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue.\n Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies.\n Further studies of the pathogenesis of SARS may reveal new insight into the mechanisms of DAD.\n","id":"PMC7119137","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

other reasons.\n SARS-CoV was detected in all 22 postmortem lung tissues (to 109 viral copies/g) from 11 patients with probable SARS but was not detected in any of the 23 lung control samples (sample

shorter course of illness but not with the use of ribavirin or steroids.\n CoV was consistently identified in the lungs of all patients who died of SARS but not in control patients, supporting a primary role for CoV in deaths.\n","id":"PMC3322746","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Centers for Disease Control and

new human infectious disease with significant morbidity and mortality.\n The disease has been shown to be associated with a new coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n The clinical and epidemiological aspects of SARS have been described.\n Moreover, the viral genome of SARS?CoV has been fully sequenced.\n However, much of the biological behaviour of the virus is not known and data on the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS?CoV are limited.\n In this study, six fatal cases of SARS were investigated for the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS?CoV using an in?situ hybridization (ISH) technique.\n Among all the tissues studied, positive signals were seen in pneumocytes in the lungs and surface enterocytes in the small bowel.\n Infected pneumocytes were further confirmed by immunofluorescencefluorescence in?situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.\n These results provide important information concerning the tissue tropism of SARS?CoV, which is distinct from previously identified human coronaviruses, and suggest the possible involvement of novel receptors in this infection.\n Whereas the lung pathology was dominated by diffuse alveolar damage, the gut was relatively intact.\n These findings indicated that tissue responses to SARS?CoV infection are distinct in different organs.\n Copyright © 2004 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.\n","id":"PMC7167900","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John

mechanisms of coronavirus RNA capping and methylation","abstract":"The 5?-cap structures of eukaryotic mRNAs are important for RNA stability, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export, and protein translation.\n Many viruses have evolved mechanisms for generating their own cap structures with methylation at the N7 position of the capped guanine and the ribose 2?-Oposition of the first nucleotide, which help viral RNAs escape recognition by the host innate immune system.\n The RNA genomes of coronavirus were identified to have 5?-caps in the early 1980s.\n However, for decades the RNA capping mechanisms of coronaviruses remained unknown.\n Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses.\n Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5?-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic

virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes.\n Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV.\n The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses.\n However, the external subdomain of Spikes receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses.\n Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein.\n Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.\n Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR

patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

epidemiological studies of SARS comparing epidemiologic features across regions.\n\n The aim of this study is to identify similarities and differences in SARS epidemiology in three populations with similar host and viral genotype.\n\n\nMethods\nWe present a comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS, based on an integrated dataset with 3,336 SARS patients from Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan, epidemiological and clinical characteristics such as incubation, onset-to-admission, onset-to-discharge and onset-to-death periods, case fatality ratios (CFRs) and presenting symptoms are described and compared between regions.\n\n We further explored the influence of demographic and clinical variables on the apparently large differences in CFRs between the three regions.\n\n\nResults\nAll three regions showed similar incubation periods and progressive shortening of the onset-to-admission interval through the epidemic.\n\n Adjusted for sex, health care worker status and nosocomial setting, older age was associated with a higher fatality, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.45, 3.04) for those aged 51-60; AOR: 4.57 (95% confidence interval: 3.32, 7.30) for those aged above 60 compared to those aged 41-50 years.\n\n Presence of pre-existing comorbid conditions was also associated with greater mortality (AOR: 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.36, 2.21).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe large discrepancy in crude fatality ratios across the three regions can only be partly explained by epidemiological and clinical heterogeneities.\n\n Our findings underline the importance of a common data collection platform, especially in an emerging epidemic, in order to identify and explain consistencies and differences in the eventual clinical and public health outcomes of infectious disease outbreaks, which is becoming increasingly important in our highly interconnected world.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2846944","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

by interspecies transmission.\n Considering the diversity of bat coronaviruses, bat species and populations, we expect to discover more bat CoVs through virus surveillance.\n In this study, we described a new member of alphaCoV (BtCoV/Rh/YN2012) in bats with unique genome features.\n Unique accessory genes, ORF4a and ORF4b were found between the spike gene and the envelope gene, while ORF8 gene was found downstream of the nucleocapsid gene.\n All the putative genes were further confirmed by reverse-transcription analyses.\n One unique gene at the 3 end of the BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 genome, ORF9, exhibits ~30% amino acid identity to ORF7a of the SARS-related coronavirus.\n Functional analysis showed ORF4a protein can activate IFN-? production, whereas ORF3a can regulate NF-?B production.\n We also screened the spike-mediated virus entry using the spike-pseudotyped retroviruses system, although failed to find any fully permissive cells.\n Our results expand the knowledge on the genetic diversity of bat coronaviruses.\n Continuous screening of bat viruses will help us further understand the important role played by bats in coronavirus evolution and

2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

detected in ACE2+ cells in the lungs and other organs, indicating that ACE2?expressing cells are the primary targets for SARS?CoV infection in vivo in humans.\n High levels of PICs were expressed in the SARS?CoV?infected ACE2+ cells, but not in the uninfected cells.\n These results suggest that cells infected by SARS?CoV produce elevated levels of PICs which may cause immuno?mediated damage to the lungs and other organs, resulting in ALI and, subsequently, multi?organ dysfunction.\n Therefore application of PIC antagonists may reduce the severity and mortality of SARS.\n Copyright © 2006

Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.\n One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses.\n Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV.\n This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.\n","id":"PMC7081895","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Yushun","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rachel","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Gallagher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Gallagher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/eci.13209","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel Chinese coronavirus (2019?nCoV) infections: Challenges for fighting the storm","abstract":"","id":"PMC7163647","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Matteo","surname":"Bassetti","email":"matteo.bassetti@unige.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Vena","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniele Roberto","surname":"Giacobbe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.tim.2016.03.003","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiology, Genetic Recombination, and Pathogenesis of Coronaviruses","abstract":"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first described in the 1960s for patients with the common cold.\n Since then, more HCoVs have been discovered, including those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), two pathogens that, upon infection, can cause fatal respiratory disease in humans.\n It was recently discovered that dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia harbor three different HCoV species, including a dominant MERS HCoV lineage that was responsible for the outbreaks in the Middle East and South Korea during 2015.

(TGF-?)-induced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 but attenuates Smad3/Smad4-mediated apoptosis of human peripheral lung epithelial HPL1 cells.\n The promoting effect of N protein on the transcriptional responses of TGF-? is Smad3-specific.\n N protein associates with Smad3 and promotes Smad3-p300 complex formation while it interferes with the complex formation between Smad3 and Smad4. These findings provide evidence of a novel mechanism whereby N protein modulates TGF-? signaling to block apoptosis of SARS-CoV-infected host cells and meanwhile promote tissue fibrosis.\n Our results reveal a novel mode of Smad3 action in a Smad4-independent manner and may lead to successful strategies for SARS treatment by targeting the TGF-? signaling molecules.\n","id":"PMC8740907","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"ASBMB.

These genes differ distinctly among the three coronavirus groups and are specific for each group.\n While the essential genes encode replication and structural functions, hardly anything is known about the products and functions of the group-specific genes.\n As a first step to elucidate their significance, we deleted the group-specific genes from the group 2 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome via a novel targeted recombination system based on host switching (L.\n Kuo, G.\n J.\nGodeke, M.\n J.\n Raamsman, P.\n S.\n Masters, and P.\n J.\n M.\n Rottier, 2000, J.\n Virol.\n 74, 13931406).\n Thus, we obtained recombinant viruses from which the two clusters of group-specific genes were deleted either separately or in combination in a controlled genetic background.\n As all recombinant deletion mutant viruses appeared to be viable, we conclude that the MHV group-specific genes are nonessential, accessory genes.\n Importantly, all deletion mutant viruses were attenuated when inoculated into their natural host, the mouse.\n Therefore, deletion of the coronavirus group-specific genes seems to provide an attractive approach to generate attenuated live coronavirus

to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases (bringing the total number of SARS-CoV proteins to 28).\n A phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene, using a distantly related torovirus as

group 2 coronaviruses, with four of them being conserved in SARS-CoV.\n These newly recognized viral enzymes place the mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis in a completely new perspective.\n

Efficacy in Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoVchallenged mice.\n\n VRP-Ninduced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Mouse-Adapted SARS-Coronavirus Causes Disease and Mortality in BALB/c Mice","abstract":"No single animal model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reproduces all aspects of the human disease.\n Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals.\n","id":"PMC1769406","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

respiratory disease, SARS, with significant mortality.\n Although factors contributing to the highly pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV remain poorly understood, it has been reported that SARS-CoV infection does not induce type I interferons (IFNs) in cell culture.\n However, it is uncertain whether SARS-CoV evades host detection or has evolved mechanisms to counteract innate host defenses.\n We show here that infection of SARS-CoV triggers a weak IFN response in cultured human lung/bronchial epithelial cells without inducing the phosphorylation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a latent cellular transcription factor that is pivotal for type I IFN synthesis.\n Furthermore, SARS-CoV infection blocked the induction of IFN antiviral activity and the up-regulation of protein expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes triggered by double-stranded RNA or an unrelated paramyxovirus.\n In searching for a SARS-CoV protein capable of counteracting innate immunity, we identified the papain-like protease (PLpro) domain as a potent IFN antagonist.\n The inhibition of the IFN response does not require the protease activity of PLpro.\n Rather, PLpro interacts with IRF-3 and inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3, thereby disrupting the activation of type I IFN responses through either Toll-like receptor 3 or retinoic acid-inducible gene I/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 pathways.\n Our data suggest that regulation of IRF-3-dependent innate antiviral defenses by PLpro may contribute to the establishment of SARS-CoV

Distinct glial cell cytokine and chemokine response patterns were observed within 3 days after infection, became progressively more polarized during the course of infection and with the infiltration of leukocytes.\n In the brain, MHV-JHM infection induced strong accumulation of IFN? mRNA relative to IFN? mRNA.\n This trend was reversed in MHV-A59 infection and was accompanied by increased CD8 T cell infiltration into brain compared to MHV-JHM infection.\n Increased apoptosis appeared to contribute to the diminished presence of CD8 T cells in MHV-JHM-infected brain with the consequence of a lower potential for IFN? production and antiviral activity.\n MHV-JHM infection also induced sustained mRNA accumulation of the innate immune response products interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1. Furthermore, high levels of macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1?, MIP-1?, and MIP-2 mRNA were observed at the onset of MHV-JHM infection and correlated with a marked elevation in the number of

the ability of the virus to circumvent innate immunity.\n Using functional genomics, we analyzed early host responses to SARS-CoV infection in the lungs of adolescent cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that show lung pathology similar to that observed in human adults with SARS.\n Analysis of gene signatures revealed induction of a strong innate immune response characterized by the stimulation of various cytokine and chemokine genes, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IP-10, which corresponds to the host response seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n As opposed to many in vitro experiments, SARS-CoV induced a wide range of type I interferons (IFNs) and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in the lungs of macaques.\n Using immunohistochemistry, we revealed that these antiviral signaling pathways were differentially regulated in distinctive subsets of cells.\n Our studies emphasize that the induction of early IFN signaling may be critical to confer protection against SARS-CoV infection and highlight the strength of combining functional genomics with immunohistochemistry to further unravel the

effectiveness of treatment options.\n\n The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nIn response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients.\n\n We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria.\n\n In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria.\n\n Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture.\n\n In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm.\n\n Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive.\n\n In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm.\n\n\nConclusions\nDespite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak.\n\n Some may have been harmful.\n\n Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and to accrue data in real time during future outbreaks to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1564166","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Lauren

Radiolabeling with carbohydrate precursors and borate gel electrophoresis of glycopeptides show that different oligcsaccharide side chains are attached to El and E2. The two coronavirus envelope glycoproteins thus appear to be glycosylated by different mechanisms.\n In tunicamycin-treated cells, noninfectious virions lacking peplomers are formed at intracytoplasmic membranes and released from the cells.\n These virions contain normal amounts of nucleocapsid protein and glycosylated El, but lack E2. Thus the transmembrane glycoprotein El is the only viral glycoprotein required for the formation of the viral envelope or for virus maturation and release.\n The peplomeric glycoprotein E2 appears to be required for attachment to virus receptors on the plasma membrane.\n The coronavirus envelope envelope glycoprotein E1 appears to be a novel type of viral glycoprotein which is post-translationally glycosylated by a tunicamycin-resistant process that yields oligosaccharide side chains different from those of N-linked glycoproteins.\n These findings suggest that El may be particularly useful as a

(SARSCoV).\n\n We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

but the pathogenesis is still unclear.\n\n\nMethods\nPost-mortem tissue samples from six patients who died from SARS in February and March, 2003, and an open lung biopsy from one of these patients were studied by histology and virology.\n\n Only one full autopsy was done.\n\n Evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human metapneumovirus was sought by reverse-transcriptase PCR and serology.\n\n Pathological samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\n\n\nFindings\nAll six patients had serological evidence of recent infection with SARS-CoV.\n\n Diffuse alveolar damage was common but not universal.\n\n Morphological changes identified were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia.\n\n Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case.\n\n A giant-cell infiltrate was seen in four patients, with a pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung.\n\n Haemophagocytosis was present in two patients.\n\n The alveolar pneumocytes also showed cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm.\n\n The patient for whom full autopsy was done had atrophy of the white pulp of the spleen.\n\n Electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells corresponding to coronavirus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nSARS is associated with epithelial-cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages in the lung.\n\n The presence of haemophagocytosis supports the contention that cytokine dysregulation may account, at least partly, for the severity of the clinical disease.\n\n The case definition of SARS should acknowledge the range of lung pathology associated with this

China","abstract":"In order to investigate the clinical pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the autopsies of three patients who died from SARS in Nan Fang Hospital Guangdong, China were studied retrospectively.\n Routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to study all of the tissues from the three cases.\n The lung tissue specimens were studied further with Macchiavello staining, viral inclusion body staining, reticulin staining, PAS staining, immunohistochemistry, ultrathin sectioning and staining, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.\n The first symptom was hyperpyrexia in all three cases, followed by progressive dyspnoea and lung field shadowing.\n The pulmonary lesions included bilateral extensive consolidation, localized haemorrhage and necrosis, desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis, proliferation and desquamation of alveolar epithelial cells, exudation of protein and monocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells in alveoli, hyaline membrane formation, and viral inclusion bodies in alveolar epithelial cells.\n There was also massive necrosis of splenic lymphoid tissue and localized necrosis in lymph nodes.\n Systemic vasculitis included oedema, localized fibrinoid necrosis, and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and the stroma of striated muscles.\n Thrombosis was present in small veins.\n Systemic toxic changes included degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and adrenal gland.\n Electron microscopy demonstrated clusters of viral particles, consistent with coronavirus, in lung tissue.\n SARS is a systemic disease that injures many organs.\n The lungs, immune organs, and systemic small vessels are the main targets of virus attack, so that extensive consolidation of the lung, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, respiratory distress, and decreased immune function are the main causes of death.\n Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons,

novel coronavirus (CoV).\n Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with SARS but the significance remains undetermined.\n Herein, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and virologic features of the intestinal involvement of this new viral infection.\n Methods: A retrospective analysis of the gastrointestinal symptoms and other clinical parameters of the first 138 patients with confirmed SARS admitted for a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003 was performed.\n Intestinal specimens were obtained by colonoscopy or postmortem examination to detect the presence of coronavirus by electron microscopy, virus culture, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n Results: Among these 138 patients with SARS, 28 (20.3%) presented with watery diarrhea and up to 38.4% of patients had symptoms of diarrhea during the course of illness.\n Diarrhea was more frequently observed during the first week of illness.\n The mean number of days with diarrhea was 3.7 ± 2.7, and most diarrhea was self-limiting.\n Intestinal biopsy specimens obtained by colonoscopy or autopsy showed minimal architectural disruption but the presence of active viral replication within both the small and large intestine.\n Coronavirus was also isolated by culture from these specimens, and SARS-CoV RNA can be detected in the stool of patients for more than 10 weeks after symptom onset.\n Conclusions: Diarrhea is a common presenting symptom of SARS.\n The intestinal tropism of the SARS-CoV has major implications on clinical presentation and viral transmission.\n","id":"PMC7126982","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Gastroenterological Association.

Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently present in these cancers, and some of the aberrantly methylated genes are causally involved in cancer development and progression.\n Notably, aberrant DNA methylation can be present even in non-cancerous or precancerous tissues, and its levels correlate with the risk of cancer development, producing a so-called epigenetic field for cancerization.\n Mechanistically, most viral or bacterial infections induce DNA methylation indirectly via chronic inflammation, but recent studies have indicated that some viruses have direct effects on the epigenetic machinery of host cells.\n From a translational viewpoint, a recent multicenter prospective cohort study demonstrated that assessment of the extent of alterations in DNA methylation in non-cancerous tissues can be used to predict cancer risk.\n Furthermore, suppression of aberrant DNA methylation was shown to be a useful strategy for cancer prevention in an animal model.\n Here, we review the involvement of aberrant DNA methylation in various types of infection-associated cancers, along with individual induction mechanisms, and we discuss the application of these findings for

pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

world on alert.\n 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.\n One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses.\n Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV.\n This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel

patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n We postulated that repleting ACE2 using GSK2586881, a recombinant form of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2), could attenuate acute lung injury.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We conducted a two-part phase II trial comprising an open-label intrapatient dose escalation and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase in ten intensive care units in North America.\n\n Patients were between the ages of 18 and 80 years, had an American-European Consensus Criteria consensus diagnosis of ARDS, and had been mechanically ventilated for less than 72 h.\n\n In part A, open-label GSK2586881 was administered at doses from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.8 mg/kg to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.\n\n Following review of data from part A, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of twice-daily doses of GSK2586881 (0.4 mg/kg) for 3 days was conducted (part B).\n\n Biomarkers, physiological assessments, and clinical endpoints were collected over the dosing period and during follow-up.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Dose escalation in part A was well-tolerated without clinically significant hemodynamic changes.\n\n Part B was terminated after 39 of the planned 60 patients following a planned futility analysis.\n\n Angiotensin II levels decreased rapidly following infusion of GSK2586881, whereas angiotensin-(17) and angiotensin-(15) levels increased and remained elevated for 48 h.\n\n Surfactant protein D concentrations were increased, whereas there was a trend for a decrease in interleukin-6 concentrations in rhACE2-treated subjects compared with placebo.\n\n No significant differences were noted in ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen, oxygenation index, or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>GSK2586881 was well-tolerated in patients with ARDS, and the rapid modulation of RAS peptides suggests target engagement, although the study was not powered to detect changes in acute physiology or clinical outcomes.\n\n\nTrial registration\nid='Par5'>ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov,

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health13.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020.

was to look for the warning index in severe COVID?19 patients.\n We investigated 43 adult patients with COVID?19. The patients were classified into mild group (28 patients) and severe group (15 patients).\n A comparison of the hematological parameters between the mild and severe groups showed significant differences in interleukin?6 (IL?6), d?dimer (d?D), glucose, thrombin time, fibrinogen, and C?reactive protein (P?&lt;?.\n05).\n The optimal threshold and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) of IL?6 were 24.3 and 0.795?µg/L, respectively, while those of d?D were 0.28 and 0.750?µg/L, respectively.\n The area under the ROC curve of IL?6 combined with d?D was 0.840. The specificity of predicting the severity of COVID?19 during IL?6 and d?D tandem testing was up to 93.3%, while the sensitivity of IL?6 and d?D by parallel test in the severe COVID?19 was 96.4%.\n IL?6 and d?D were closely related to the occurrence of severe COVID?19 in the adult patients, and their combined detection had the highest specificity and sensitivity for early prediction of the severity of COVID?19 patients, which has important clinical value.\n","id":"PMC7228247","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

serious outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.\n\n Related clinical features are needed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan between January 16 to January 29, 2020. All patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020.\nResults\nThe median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients (46%) were men.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]), cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]).\n\n Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients).\n\n As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%.\n\n According to the lowest SpO2 during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2?90% group (n=55) and the SpO2&lt;90% group (n=14).\n\n All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2&lt;90% group.\n\n Compared with SpO2?90% group, patients of the SpO2&lt;90% group were older, and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c reactive protein.\n\n Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate.\n\n\nConclusions\nCOVID-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5%.\n\n Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184452","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhongliang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bohan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianwen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Wen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiguang","surname":"Zhang","email":"zrg27@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s12519-020-00354-4","date":"2020-03-02","title":"Clinical features of severe pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan: a single centers observational study","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China.\n\n People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n No information on severe pediatric patients with COVID-19 has been reported.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Childrens Hospital from January 24 to February 24.

coronavirus (MERS-CoV) remains poorly understood.\n In a previous study, we established an hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mouse model in which MERS-CoV infection causes severe acute respiratory failure and high mortality accompanied by an elevated secretion of cytokines and chemokines.\n Since excessive complement activation is an important factor that contributes to acute lung injury after viral infection, in this study, we investigated the role of complement in MERS-CoV-induced lung damage.\n Our study showed that complement was excessively activated in MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-Tg mice through observations of increased concentrations of the C5a and C5b-9 complement activation products in sera and lung tissues, respectively.\n Interestingly, blocking C5a production by targeting its receptor, C5aR, alleviated lung and spleen tissue damage and reduced inflammatory responses.\n More importantly, anti-C5aR antibody treatment led to decreased viral replication in lung tissues.\n Furthermore, compared with the sham treatment control, apoptosis of splenic cells was less pronounced in the splenic white pulp of treated mice, and greater number of proliferating splenic cells, particularly in the red pulp, was observed.\n These data indicate that (1) dysregulated host immune responses contribute to the severe outcome of MERS; (2) excessive complement activation, triggered by MERS-CoV infection, promote such dysregulation; and (3) blockade of the C5aC5aR axis lead to the decreased tissue damage induced by MERS-CoV infection, as manifested by reduced apoptosis and T cell regeneration in the spleen.\n Therefore, the results of this study suggest a new strategy for clinical intervention and adjunctive treatment in MERS-CoV

have demonstrated that the host complement system contributes to development of disease.\n In this study, we have used a mouse model of RRV-induced disease to identify and characterize which complement activation pathways mediate disease progression after infection, and we have identified the mannose binding lectin (MBL) pathway, but not the classical or alternative complement activation

disease, tissue damage, and complement deposition compared to wild-type mice.\n In contrast, mice deficient for key components of the classical or alternative complement activation pathways still developed severe RRV-induced disease.\n Further characterization of MBL deficient mice demonstrated that similar to C3?/? mice, viral replication and inflammatory cell recruitment were equivalent to wild type animals, suggesting that RRV-mediated induction of complement dependent immune pathology is largely MBL dependent.\n Consistent with these findings, human patients diagnosed with RRV disease had elevated serum MBL levels compared to healthy controls, and MBL levels in the serum and synovial fluid correlated with severity of disease.\n These findings demonstrate a role for MBL in promoting RRV-induced disease in both mice and humans and suggest that the MBL pathway of complement activation may be an effective target for therapeutic intervention for humans suffering from RRV-induced

member in the family Coronaviridae.\n To evaluate the lung pathology in this life-threatening respiratory illness, we studied postmortem lung sections from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak.\n The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage.\n The histology varied according to the duration of illness.\n Cases of 10 or fewer days duration demonstrated acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin.\n Cases of more than 10 days duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia.\n In acute-phase DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes.\n Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and CD68 staining.\n SARS-CoV RNA was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue, including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue.\n Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies.\n Further studies of the pathogenesis of SARS may reveal new insight into the mechanisms of DAD.\n","id":"PMC7119137","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Teri

BALB/c Mice","abstract":"No single animal model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reproduces all aspects of the human disease.\n Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals.\n","id":"PMC1769406","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, and the general extent of organ involvement and the microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised. Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID-19-associated organ alterations.\nMethods and results\nThis article reports the autopsy findings of 21 COVID-19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland.

The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage and massive capillary congestion, often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation. Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia. Further findings included pulmonary embolism (n = 4), alveolar haemorrhage (n = 3), and vasculitis (n = 1). Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised and five of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy. Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy. Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus).

COVID-19, caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), subsequently spread to&gt; 205 countries and territories, with a current count of&gt; 2.5 million cases and&gt; 170 000 deaths worldwide. 6  Clinical data suggest that SARS, MERS and COVID-19 manifest with similar respiratory symptoms of varying severity.\nSince the outbreak, healthcare professionals and researchers have been working together to decipher the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Although the latest literature provides insights into clinical manifestations, 7  published histopathology and autopsy findings currently remain scarce. 8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13  \nSeveral studies presenting postmortem findings of SARS patients have been published, but only few of them incorporated whole body autopsies. 14 ,  15  Although SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was detected in many organ systems, the primary finding associated with the cause of death was respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Bronchopneumonia was also a common finding, especially in patients with longer disease duration, who then also showed signs of organising pneumonia. 16 ,  17  In some cases, secondary lymphoid organs showed profound lymphoid depletion and disruption of architecture, indicating a complex pathophysiology beyond the respiratory system. Instead, like other generalised viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection, SARS affects the immune system, purportedly leading to generalised immune system dysfunction. 18  This might be a major difference between infections caused by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the latter being more contagious but less virulent. 19  \nAutopsy studies on MERS are limited; according to our knowledge, there is currently only one complete autopsy case study described in the literature. 20  A 45-year-old previously healthy male with typical clinical manifestations of MERS died 8 days after first hospital admission. Similarly to what is seen with SARS, major histomorphological findings included exudative DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, single syncytial cells, and interstitial septal lymphoid infiltrates. The trachea and bronchi also showed lymphoid infiltrates. The kidneys and the heart predominantly showed changes related to hypertension. The spleen and lymph nodes showed an increase in immunoblasts and reactive changes, whereas left-shifted myelopoiesis was seen in the bone marrow. Ancillary studies using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy revealed the exclusive presence of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the lungs and submucosal bronchial glands, and confirmed dipeptidyl peptidase 4, a cell surface receptor, as a point of entry for MERS-CoV. This led to the conclusion that the pathological findings in other organs were probably attributable to secondary causes (due to previous steroid medication) and sequelae of shock. A postmortem investigation of core needle biopsies yielded similar results but did show viral particles in the kidneys. 21  \nOwing to our comparatively high autopsy rate (~20% of hospital deaths in the last decade), we have the opportunity to rely on a well-equipped and experienced team for autopsy-related investigations. Our study summarises the findings of a comprehensively analysed autopsy cohort of 21 patients from two Swiss hospitals in order to provide an overview of organ pathologies related to COVID-19.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy Cohort\nAll autopsies were performed at the Institute of Pathology at the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland (n = 11) and the Institute of Pathology at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland (n = 10). In most cases, full body autopsy was performed (n = 17). Partial autopsy of the upper respiratory tract, lungs and heart was carried out in some cases, owing to the wishes of patients or relatives, or excessive obesity. Clinical features, including comorbidities, radiological findings, and medication history, are shown in Table 1 and Table S1. The mean postmortem interval from death to autopsy was 33.3 h (11-84.5 h). This study received approval from the Ethics Committee of Northwestern and Central Switzerland (ID 2020-00629).\nSummary of clinical parameters\nParameter	Value	 	Sex: male/female ratio	17:4	 	Age (years), mean (range)	76 (53-96)	 	Days in hospital (range)	5.7 (0-16)	 	Number (%) of intubated patients	6 (30)	 	Hours between death and autopsy (range)	33.2 (11.0-84.5)	 	Comorbidities, n (%)	 	Hypertension	21 (100)	 	Cardiovascular disease	15 (71)	 	Smoker	8 (40)	 	Pre-obesity/obesity (WHO grade 1/2/3)	10/1/1/4 (48/5/5/19)	 	Diabetes mellitus	7 (35)	 	Chronic neurological condition	5 (24)	 	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	3 (15)	 	Malignancy	3 (15)	 	Chronic liver disease	2 (10)	 	Chronic kidney disease	4 (19)	 	Acquired immunosuppression	1 (5)	 	Initial clinical presentation, n (%)	 	Cough	16 (76)	 	Fever	12 (57)	 	Dyspnoea/tachypnoea	10 (48)	 	Pancytopenia	2 (10)	 	Diarrhoea	1 (5)	 	Acute or acute-on-chronic kidney injury	12/18 (67)	 	Radiological findings, n (%)	 	Ground glass infiltrates	12 (57)	 	Initial laboratory findings upon admission*	 	Haemoglobin (120-180 g/l), level (range)	122.4 (97-209)	 	Anaemia, n (%)	7/11 (64)	 	Total white blood cell count (3.5-10 x 10-9/l), value (range)	8.7 (3.3-24.7)	 	Leucopoenia, n (%)	3/11 (27)	 	Leucocytosis, n (%)	3/11 (27)	 	Neutrophils (40-74%), % (range)	84 (63.4-96.4)	 	Lymphocytes (19-48%), % (range)	9.4 (1.0-23.5)	 	Platelets (150-450 x 10-9/l), value (range)	229.4 (25-433)	 	Creatinine (mumol/l), level (range)	254.7 (39-623)	 	ASAT (11-34 U/l) (in 10 patients), level (range)	67.2 (22-214)	 	LDH (&lt;135 U/l) (in 10 patients), level (range)	450.5 (171-661)	 	D-dimers (&lt;0.19 mug/ml) (in 5 patients), level (range)	4.0 (0.4-10.4)	 	IL-6 (&lt;7 ng/l) (in 5 patients), level (range)	217.6 (103-278)	 	Intake of agents interfering with RAAS , n (%)	14/21 (67)	 	Intake of anticoagulation*, 	 	 	 	, n (%)	11/11 (100)	 	\nASAT, aspartate aminotransferase; IL, interleukin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; RAAS, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; WHO, World Health Organization.\nAll normal ranges of laboratory values with designated units are shown in parentheses.\nBasel cohort only.\nAgents interfering directly or indirectly with the RAAS: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and aldosterone inhibitors.\nAgents included heparin and its derivatives, new oral anticoagulants (NOACs), warfarin, and vitamin K antagonists.\nAutopsy Technique Applied\nAs a safety precaution against infection, our institute developed a COVID-19-optimised autopsy protocol in line with recently published recommendations. 22  Two hours prior to autopsy, 4% phosphate-buffered formalin was instilled into the mouth, nose, and pharynx. Autopsies were performed in a room with adequate airflow (more than six air changes per hour of total room volume) under conditions similar to those recommended for autopsies of those who have died from suspected Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (i.e. hazmat suits, boots, goggles, and FFP2/3 masks) with an in-corpore technique analogous to that used in forensic institutions. Thoracic organs were eviscerated (see below), and the heart was separately dissected in the direction of blood flow. Parenchymal organs (liver, spleen, kidney, and pancreas) were dissected within the body. After mobilisation of the small and large intestines, their exterior surfaces were inspected; if there were any outstanding findings, tissue was excised for further macroscopic and histological examination. In all cases, tissue samples from the liver, heart and kidney were histologically examined. Other organs, as well as bone marrow and the brain, were analysed upon specific clinical indication (younger age; neurological symptoms). To avoid aerosolisation, the brain was removed by opening the skull with a handsaw; bone marrow from the iliac crest was also procured with a handsaw. A detailed description of this in-corpore protocol is provided in Doc. S1.\nThe lungs, trachea and larynx were exenterated intact and perfused via the trachea with 4% refrigerated (4 C) phosphate-buffered formalin. The trachea was then closed with a clamp, and the specimens immersed in formalin at room temperature for 72 h before dissection. The lungs were subsequently cut into 5-10-mm parasagittal slices and examined macroscopically. Two sections of each lobe, as well as the trachea, were submitted for histological examination.\nAncillary Techniques\nTissue samples were processed with standard histochemical methods, i.e. haematoxylin and eosin staining (all organs), chromotrope aniline blue staining (heart and liver), Giemsa staining (bone marrow), and periodic acid-Schiff reaction (bone marrow, kidney, and spleen). Additional stains [Congo red, Prussian blue and rhodamine (copper), Gram, Brown-Brenn and/or Grocott methenamine silver stain] were used when necessary.\nImmunohistochemical examinations were performed for fibrin, amyloid transthyretin (ATTR), CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, multiple myeloma 1 and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) as previously described. 23 ,  24 ,  25  \nIn all cases, the postmortem viral load was measured in lungs and other selected organs by means of a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was extracted with the RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Viral genomes were detected with the TaqMan 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which targets three different viral genomic regions (ORFab1, S protein, and N protein) and the human RNase P gene (RPPH1). The number of viral genomes was determined with the TaqMan 2019-nCoV Control Kit v1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a comparative C t (DeltaDeltaC t) method. The method generates individual copy numbers for human RPPH1 and the three SARS-CoV-2 targets. Mean copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 targets were scaled to 1 x 106 RPPH1 copies.\nElectron microscopy was performed on two lung and kidney specimens according to standard institute protocols. Tissue was fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde and examined by use of a transmission electron microscope (Morgagni 268D; FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA).\nResults\nClinical Characteristics\nOur patient cohort had a male/female ratio of 17:4 (i.e. 81% males), and a mean age of 76 years (53-96 years). All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by use of an antemortem polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 performed on a nasopharyngeal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or sputum (median of 7.15 days before death; range, 0-20 days). Most commonly, patients presented with dry cough and fever (n = 16 and n = 12, respectively). The mean hospitalisation time before death was 5.7 days (range, 0-16 days). One patient died in the emergency room prior to admission to the ward. Six patients had been intubated.\nAll patients suffered from comorbidities, with hypertension and (pre-)obesity being most common. Fourteen patients (67%) had a history of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-modulating drug intake. Two patients had been treated with immunosuppressive drugs before contracting COVID-19, and one suffered from acquired immunodeficiency. In this cohort, 65% had blood group A:although the population incidence in Switzerland is 45%, 26  this discrepancy did not reach statistical significance.\nClinical characteristics, symptoms and radiological and laboratory findings are summarised in Table 1. Detailed information is given in Table S1.\nLung and Upper Airway Findings\nOne-third of patients presented with severe mucous tracheitis/tracheobronchitis. Gross findings in the lungs were heterogeneous (Figure 1A,B), ranging from patchy to diffuse areas of consolidation to severe and extensive suppurative bronchopneumonic infiltrates. In all cases, the lung parenchyma was heavy and firm, and unevenly bluish-red in colour, with signs of severe congestion. The most prominent histological finding was severe capillary congestion (capillarostasis) accompanied by hyaline membranes, reactive pneumocyte changes and syncytial cells corresponding to exudative DAD (Figure 2A). Eight cases showed proliferative DAD (38%). In 10 cases, superimposed bronchopneumonia with both a focal and a diffuse (n = 6) distribution was seen. On immunohistochemistry, syncytial cells were shown to be of pneumocytic origin (expression of TTF1; Figure 2B). Most lungs showed a paucity of interstitial leucocytes, especially lymphocytes, whereas three showed a moderate lymphoid inflammatory infiltrate; in one of these three cases, no viral RNA was detectable in the lungs as determined by postmortem PCR. Three cases showed severe and extensive bronchopneumonia without typical features of DAD; however, in areas without pneumonia, severe capillarostasis was consistently noted (Figure 2C). Other lung pathologies included oedema and alveolar haemorrhage in conjunction with pulmonary embolism. One case, additionally suffering from bronchopneumonia, showed focal vasculitis and capillaritis with a predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate. In five of 11 cases in which immunohistochemistry for fibrin was performed, microthrombi were detected in alveolar capillaries (Figure 2D). Four cases showed peripheral and prominent central pulmonary embolism. Table 2 summarises the most important autopsy findings. Detailed autopsy findings for each patient are shown in Table S2. Scanned slides of each patient showing representative findings in the lungs, heart and kidney, as well as other relevant organs, are available in Doc. S2.\nGross lung findings.

Unfortunately, subcellular structures could not be analysed, owing to autolysis. However, fibrin precipitates were detected within alveolar capillaries in both cases.\nCardiovascular System Findings\nMyocardial hypertrophy was a common finding (71%), correlating with the high prevalence of hypertension in this cohort. There was one case with acute myocardial infarction. Peracute focal necrosis of cardiomyocytes as a sequela of shock was seen in three patients. Six patients aged 76-96 years were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry for ATTR upon autopsy. Three of these cases showed amyloid deposits in pulmonary vessels. The prevalence of senile amyloidosis in our cohort achieved statistical significance when compared with age-matched autopsies performed at our institute in 2018-2019 (six of 21 versus 22 of 345 autopsies, P = 0.000137, Mann-Whitney U-test). Severe generalised atherosclerosis, defined by the presence of ulcerated plaques of the aorta, was present in 70% of cases.\nKidney Findings\nOn gross examination, renal signs of shock were seen in most autopsies. Histologically, these findings correspond to diffuse acute tubular injury with widened tubular lumina, flattened tubular epithelium, and interstitial oedema (Figure 3A). Three of 18 patients showed signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, with small fibrin thrombi in glomerular capillaries (Figure 3B). One of these cases also presented with an anaemic infarct. Thrombi in other vessels or vasculitic changes were not seen. A focal and sparse chronic inflammatory infiltrate was present in a few cases in areas with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Pre-existing chronic changes, such as arteriolosclerosis, intimal fibrosis of arteries, and vascular scarring related to hypertension and/or ageing, were present in the majority of cases. These findings were particularly prominent in the four patients with known chronic kidney disease of either diabetic or hypertensive aetiology.\nFindings in other organs. A, Kidney showing acute tubular damage without evidence of increased inflammatory infiltrates [periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain]. B, Kidney showing disseminated intravascular coagulation (PAS). C, Florid splenitis showing increases in neutrophil numbers in the perifollicular and marginal zones of the spleen (PAS). D, Lymph node showing an increase in the number of plasmablasts in the interfollicular zone as well as congestion (haematoxylin and eosin). Insert: immunohistochemistry for multiple myeloma 1.\nTransmission electron microscopy was performed on two cases with a short (&lt;12 h) postmortem period. In both cases, we observed prominent activation of podocytes, endothelial cells and proximal tubular epithelial cells. The cytoplasm of podocytes contained multiple vesicles, some with attached ribosomes and double membranes. Occasionally, virus-like particles (7-110 nm) with electron-dense granules were detected within these vesicles (Figure 4A,B). Sporadically, these particles were present in endothelial cells (Figure 4C) and proximal tubular epithelial cells (Figure 4D).\nElectron microscopy findings. A,B, Podocyte cytoplasm with its foot processes on top of a glomerular basement membrane containing mitochondria (upper left corner) and multiple vesicles, two of which contain several small possible virus-like particles with sizes between 70 nm and 110 nm (arrow). At higher magnification, the vesicles contain double membranes and the virus-like particles show a ring of electron-dense granules and a ragged outer contour (electron microscopy). C, An activated glomerular endothelial cell, and a vesicle close to the luminal border with virus-like particles (arrow and insert), adjacent to an erythrocyte (electron-dense structure at the top left) (electron microscopy). D, Cytoplasm of a proximal tubular epithelial cell on top of a basement membrane and adjacent collagen fibres (left side). The cytoplasm contains mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and multiple vesicles, one of which contains virus-like particles (arrow and insert, electron microscopy).\nShock Sequelae and Findings in Other Organs\nSigns of shock constituted a common finding, predominantly affecting the liver and adrenal gland.\nAmong bone marrow samples, three of four showed reactive left-shifted myelopoiesis and one case showed prominent hyperplasia of cytotoxic CD8-positive T cells. In cases with bronchopneumonia, acute splenitis and/or septic neutrophilic leucocytosis of the red pulp was seen (Figure 3C). Perihilar and paratracheal lymph nodes showed prominent congestion and sinus dilatation, as well as an increase in the number of reactive plasmablasts (Figure 3D), consistent with an activated immune response. Extensive depletion of lymphoid cells as described in SARS was not seen.\nMicroscopic analysis of the brain revealed no inflammatory infiltrates or neuronal necrosis. Three of four brains examined showed mild hypoxic injury.\nDetection of the Virus According to PCR and Central Nervous System Findings\nIn all but one patient (see above), mean 125 000 (range 16 865-749 402) viral copies/1 x 106 RPPH1 copies were detected in lung tissue by the use of SARS-CoV2-specific RT-qPCR. In other organs (brain, heart, testicle, and kidney), variable, predominantly low, RNA copy numbers were detected. In the brain, copy numbers were generally low, although values in the olfactory bulb were higher than those in the brainstem.\nDiscussion\nOur study presents a comprehensively analysed autopsy series of predominantly Caucasian COVID-19 patients. To the best of our knowledge, this cohort is larger than any autopsy cohort of COVID-19, SARS or MERS patients reported so far. In general, our cohort was older (average age 76 years) than previously published SARS and MERS autopsy collectives. Morphological manifestations in the lungs and other organ systems in COVID-19 patients were not as extensive and severe as in both SARS and MERS patients. 16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21  This fits with epidemiological studies comparing different types of coronavirus. 19  Comorbidities in our cohort correspond with clinical observational studies. 27 ,  28  Other interesting characteristics of our group included a striking predominance of males and a higher incidence of blood group A.\nTo minimise autolysis, bodies were promptly stored at 4 C after death, and the period between death and autopsy was kept as short as possible (median of 32.9 h). By applying an in-corpore autopsy technique and performing formalin fixation of thoracic organs, we strove to optimise staff safety while taking recently published recommendations into account. 22  None of the staff members involved in this study developed COVID-19.\nSimilarly to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the cytoplasm and is assembled within vesicles prior to its release without evoking typical viropathic changes. 29 ,  30  The upper respiratory tract and lungs serve as the predominant sites of entry and replication, 31  but other replication sites, such as endothelial cells 32  and the kidney, have been suggested. 33 ,  34  As expected, major morphological findings pertaining to the cause of death of our cohort were localised in the respiratory tract. 7  There was some discrepancy from the clinical diagnoses, as cases clinically diagnosed as 'pneumonia, COVID-related' only showed signs of DAD and showed no signs of suppurative bronchopneumonia, both macroscopically and histologically. Direct correlation with radiology findings was not possible, as most cases had only undergone computed tomography imaging at the time of hospital admission, and not in the course of their stay. The predominant histopathological findings in the lungs were capillary congestion, microthrombi, and, in 48% of cases, moderate intra-alveolar fibrin exudation corresponding to exudative DAD and superimposed bronchopneumonia. We considered bronchopneumonia, both in an acute and in an organising state, to be the result of bacterial superinfection, and not a direct result of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung tissue damage. Similarly to what is seen in SARS 14 ,  15  and MERS 20  patients, syncytial cells originating from type II pneumocytes were observed and there was a paucity of inflammatory infiltrates:especially lymphoid cells:in cases without concomitant bronchopneumonia. DAD was less pronounced in the patients with microthrombi, as also shown by Magro et al., 13  and, additionally, four patients developed acute pulmonary embolism. Although the presence of microthrombi can be a feature of DAD, we deduce from the former that these findings may, rather, represent a histological correlate of coagulopathies described in COVID-19 patients. 35  They corroborate the above-mentioned observation and are consistent with complement-mediated microvascular injury in the lung and/or skin. 13  One patient with superimposed bronchopneumonia showed florid vasculitis of small veins and capillaritis, which has previously been described in individual SARS cases. 14 ,  15  However, vasculitic changes of other organs or clinical findings related to systemic vasculitis were not seen, implying that the vasculitic changes could have developed in conjunction with severe bronchopneumonia, in contrast to a study that detected systemic vasculitis in COVID-19 patients. 32  \nA novel and unexpected finding of our study linking a fatal COVID-19 disease course with vascular dysfunction 36  was a high incidence of ATTR amyloidosis (n = 6/21; all diagnosed at autopsy), which was more than four times more prevalent than in non-COVID-19 autopsies conducted at our institutes during previous years. In line with this and with cumulating epidemiological evidence, hypertensive, elderly, overweight and male patients, who are particularly known for their hypercoagulability, 37  were overly represented in our cohort.\nOur series contains a high number of patients who concomitantly presented with acute-onset or acute-on-chronic-onset renal failure (12 of 18 patients at admission; 14 of 18 during the disease course), corroborating previously reported observations of a poorer outcome among this patient group. 38  In all cases with clinical evidence of kidney failure, acute tubular injury was the main histological finding, in line with a recently published report. 33  However, this histological finding is unspecific, and multiple aetiologies relate to it. Three of 18 cases investigated contained microthrombi in glomerular capillaries, which are typically observed in the context of disseminated intravascular coagulation and are usually attributable to generalised shock. However, renal SARS-CoV-2 replication could potentially have contributed to the acute kidney injury in our cohort. The following observations support this hypothesis: (i) high amounts of viral RNA were detected in kidney samples; (ii) the two samples studied with transmission electron microscopy showed virus-like particles in podocytes, glomerular endothelial cells, and especially in proximal tubular epithelial cells; and (iii) some of the patients developed microthrombi in spite of timely anticoagulation. In contrast to the study mentioned above, 33  we detected virus-like particles within vesicles and not in the cytoplasm, consistent with the coronavirus replication cycle and ultrastructural studies of infected cell cultures. 29 ,  30  \nA higher incidence of blood group A among COVID-19 patients in a large population study from China 39  correlates with the incidence in our cohort. Evidence suggests that blood group A may be associated with the failure of the pulmonary microcirculation and coagulopathies in COVID-19 patients. 35  ABO alleles genetically determine/increase von Willebrand factor (VWF) activity by  20%. 40  Individuals with the A1A1 genotype in particular show the highest blood group antigen loading of VWF, 41  thus leading to higher risk and severity (odds ratio 2.6) of thrombosis in the venous system. 42 ,  43  Moreover, evidence from previous investigations of SARS-CoV suggests a direct interaction between blood group antigen A and the viral S protein, thus facilitating virus entry via angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, 44  which was postulated to have a direct effect on the number of infected individuals and disease kinetics in SARS.\nTwo-thirds of our cases presented with a history of antihypertensive therapy intake directly or indirectly affecting the RAAS, such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) or aldosterone antagonists. These agents are among the antihypertensive drugs most frequently used in Switzerland. Previous studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 utilises ACE2 as a receptor for viral cell entry. 45  As ACE2 is up-regulated upon the administration of antihypertensive therapy affecting the RAAS, these agents might increase the susceptibility to viral invasion, thus increasing the risk of severe and lethal disease outcomes. 46  However, other experimental evidence has shown a protective effect of RAAS inhibition in COVID-19 patients, 47  and, in a recent retrospective clinical study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was associated with lower overall mortality among hospitalised COVID-19 patients with hypertension. 48  \nAll of the points above and a recent autopsy observation of endothelial damage in the kidneys and intestines in COVID-19 patients 32  thus strongly suggest the importance of virus-induced vascular dysfunction in disease progression. Notably, suppressing a COVID-19-associated 'cytokine storm' 49  with anti-interleukin-6 therapy is now a pivotal part of COVID-19 treatment. 50  Current investigations are focusing on the complement system 13  and its role in endothelial dysfunction and coagulopathy; eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against complement protein C5, 51  has shown promise in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV animal models, 52  and its efficacy is currently being investigated in a clinical trial. 53  Given the evidence of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, the efficacy of therapeutic measures such as plasma infusion and exchange and beyond may be considered. 54  \nSeveral investigations have suggested neuronal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, ranging from smell and taste dysfunction to central dysregulation of breathing. 55  In our series, four brains were analysed histologically, and no inflammatory infiltrates or neuronal necroses were observed. Interestingly, although the viral load was low in all samples, it was slightly higher in the olfactory bulb than in the brainstem, supporting the hypothesis of viral entry into the brain via the lamina cribrosa.\nIn summary, our findings provide an insight into the complexity of COVID-19 pathophysiology. SARS-CoV-2 substantially contributed to fatality in all cases, but we postulate a multifactorial cause of death, with COVID-19 as a contributory factor in multimorbid patients. Major findings that imply an impaired microcirculation include pulmonary capillarostasis and the presence of microthrombi in the lungs and kidneys despite anticoagulation. Our findings corroborate clinical and epidemiological data on cardiovascular morbidity and disease outcome, 56 ,  57 ,  58  and add ATTR amyloidosis as a risk factor, thus demonstrating the value of performing autopsies on patients with this emergent disease.\nConflicts of interest\nAll authors declare that they have no conflicting interests.\nAuthor contributions\nThe study was designed by T.

Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including

coronavirus (SARS?CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS.\n Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004

Singapore outbreak.\n The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage.\n The histology varied according to the duration of illness.\n Cases of 10 or fewer days duration demonstrated acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin.\n Cases of more than 10 days duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia.\n In acute-phase DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes.\n Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and CD68 staining.\n SARS-CoV RNA was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue, including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue.\n Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies.\n Further studies of the pathogenesis of SARS may reveal new insight into the mechanisms of DAD.\n","id":"PMC7119137","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Teri

in the 2003 Toronto outbreak.\n Autopsy material from the lungs of 20 patients who died between March and July 2003 were characterized by histology, molecular biology, and immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins, thyroid transcription factor-1, CD68, EpsteinBarr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes simplex viruses.\n Matched controls were obtained from patients who died of other causes over the same interval.\n The mean duration of illness was 27 days (range 5108 days).\n Post-mortem lung tissues from 19 of 20 patients with probable SARS were positive for SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR.\n Histologically, all patients showed varying degrees of exudative and proliferative phase acute lung injury, evidenced in conventional and immunohistochemical stains by edema, inflammatory infiltrate, pneumocyte hyperplasia, fibrinous exudates, and organization.\n Eight of 20 patients showed predominantly a diffuse alveolar damage pattern of acute lung injury, six showed predominantly an acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia pattern, and the remainder showed an admixture of the two patterns.\n Squamous metaplasia and scattered multinucleate giant cells were present in most cases.\n Vascular fibrin thrombi were a common finding and were often associated with pulmonary infarcts.\n Special stains demonstrated vascular endothelial damage of both small- and mid-sized pulmonary vessels.\n Two cases were complicated by invasive fungal disease consistent with Aspergillosis, and another by coinfection with cytomegalovirus.\n Our findings indicate that the lungs of patients who die of SARS are almost always positive for the SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR, and may show features of both diffuse alveolar damage and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia patterns of acute injury.\n Cases of SARS may be complicated by coexistent infections and therapy-related lung injury.\n","id":"PMC7100506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"United

papulosis","abstract":"Background\nDegos disease is a frequently fatal and incurable occlusive vasculopathy most commonly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract and brain.\n\n Vascular C5b-9 deposition and a type I interferon (IFN) rich microenvironment are held to be pathogenetically important in the evolution of the vascular changes.\n\n We recently discovered the use of eculizumab as a salvage drug in the treatment of near fatal Malignant atrophic papulosis (MAP).\n\n The effects of eculizumab on the pathology of MAP are explored.\n\n\nMethods\nArchival skin and gastrointestinal biopsy material was procured over a 2.5-year period before and after eculizumab therapy in our index case.\n\n Routine light microscopy and immunohistochemical assessment for C3d, C4d, C5b-9, MxA and caspase 3 were examined.\n\n Direct immunofluorescent studies were also conducted on select biopsy material.\n\n\nResults\nThe patient had received eculizumab as a emergent life saving measure and following rapid improvement he continued with biweekly infusions for 4 years.\n\n Although improved he continues to have signs and symptoms of persistent abdominal disease.\n\n Pre-Eculizumab biopsies showed an active thrombotic microangiopathy associated with a high type I interferon signature and extensive vascular deposits of C5b-9 in skin and gastrointestinal biopsies.\n\n Endothelial cell apoptosis as revealed by Caspase 3 expression was noted.\n\n Inflammation comprising lymphocytes and macrophages along with mesenchymal mucin was observed as well.\n\n Post-eculizumab biopsies did not show active luminal thrombosis but only chronic sequelae of prior episodes of vascular injury.\n\n There was no discernible caspase 3 expression.\n\n After 12 months of therapy, C5b-9 was no longer detectable in tissue.\n\n The high type I IFN signature and inflammation along with mucin deposition was not altered by the drug.\n\n In addition, there was little effect of the drug on the occlusive fibrointimal arteriopathy which appears to be one characterized by extensive myofibroblastic expansion of the intima potentially as revealed by staining for smooth muscle actin without immunoreactivity for desmin and myogenin.\n\n\nConclusions\nComplement activation and enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis play an important role in the thrombotic complications of MAP.\n\n However, the larger vessel proliferative intimal changes appear to be independent of complement activation and may be on the basis of other upstream mechanisms.\n\n Monitoring C5b-9 deposition in tissue is likely not of great value in assessing treatment response to eculizumab given the persistence of C5b-9 in tissue for several months despite clinically effective C5 blocking therapy.\n\n A more integrated approach addressing upstream and downstream pathways in addition to those attributable to complement activation are critical for the successful treatment of MAP.\n\n Eculizumab may be used as salvage therapy in critically ill patients with thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\n \n","id":"PMC3879088","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64±18 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7±4 days before admission.\n\n The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus.\n\n All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; 75% (18 patients) needed mechanical ventilation.\n\n Most of the patients (17) also had hypotension and needed vasopressors.\n\n No patient tested positive for influenza A, influenza B, or other respiratory viruses.\n\n Half the patients (12) died between ICU day 1 and day 18, including 4 patients who had a do-not-resuscitate order on admission.\n\n Of the 12 surviving patients, 5 were discharged home, 4 were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, and 3 continued to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both.\n\n Mortality among these critically ill patients was high.\n\n (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7143164","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Pavan K.","surname":"Bhatraju","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bijan J.","surname":"Ghassemieh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"Nichols","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Keith R.","surname":"Jerome","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Arun K.","surname":"Nalla","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexander L.","surname":"Greninger","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sudhakar","surname":"Pipavath","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark M.","surname":"Wurfel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Evans","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patricia A.","surname":"Kritek","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"T.

localized haemorrhage and necrosis, desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis, proliferation and desquamation of alveolar epithelial cells, exudation of protein and monocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells in alveoli, hyaline membrane formation, and viral inclusion bodies in alveolar epithelial cells.\n There was also massive necrosis of splenic lymphoid tissue and localized necrosis in lymph nodes.\n Systemic vasculitis included oedema, localized fibrinoid necrosis, and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and the stroma of striated muscles.\n Thrombosis was present in small veins.\n Systemic toxic changes included degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in the lung, liver,

SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a new member in the family Coronaviridae.\n To evaluate the lung pathology in this life-threatening respiratory illness, we studied postmortem lung sections from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak.\n The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage.\n The histology varied according to the duration of illness.\n Cases of 10 or fewer days duration demonstrated acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin.\n Cases of more than 10 days duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia.\n In acute-phase DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes.\n Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and CD68 staining.\n SARS-CoV RNA was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue, including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue.\n Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies.\n Further studies of the pathogenesis of SARS may reveal new insight into the mechanisms of DAD.\n","id":"PMC7119137","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

shorter course of illness but not with the use of ribavirin or steroids.\n CoV was consistently identified in the lungs of all patients who died of SARS but not in control patients, supporting a

new human infectious disease with significant morbidity and mortality.\n The disease has been shown to be associated with a new coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n The clinical and epidemiological aspects of SARS have been described.\n Moreover, the viral genome of SARS?CoV has been fully sequenced.\n However, much of the biological behaviour of the virus is not known and data on the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS?CoV are limited.\n In this study, six fatal cases of SARS were investigated for the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS?CoV using an in?situ hybridization (ISH) technique.\n Among all the tissues studied, positive signals were seen in pneumocytes in the lungs and surface enterocytes in the small bowel.\n Infected pneumocytes were further confirmed by immunofluorescencefluorescence in?situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.\n These results provide important information concerning the tissue tropism of SARS?CoV, which is distinct from previously identified human coronaviruses, and suggest the possible involvement of novel receptors in this infection.\n Whereas the lung pathology was dominated by diffuse alveolar damage, the gut was relatively intact.\n These findings indicated that tissue responses to SARS?CoV infection are distinct in different organs.\n Copyright © 2004 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.\n","id":"PMC7167900","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John

mechanisms of coronavirus RNA capping and methylation","abstract":"The 5?-cap structures of eukaryotic mRNAs are important for RNA stability, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export, and protein translation.\n Many viruses have evolved mechanisms for generating their own cap structures with methylation at the N7 position of the capped guanine and the ribose 2?-Oposition of the first nucleotide, which help viral RNAs escape recognition by the host innate immune system.\n The RNA genomes of coronavirus were identified to have 5?-caps in the early 1980s.\n However, for decades the RNA capping mechanisms of coronaviruses remained unknown.\n Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses.\n Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5?-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic

of China.\n Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization.\n We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes.\n Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV.\n The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses.\n However, the external subdomain of Spikes receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses.\n Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein.\n Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.\n Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR

patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

epidemiological studies of SARS comparing epidemiologic features across regions.\n\n The aim of this study is to identify similarities and differences in SARS epidemiology in three populations with similar host and viral genotype.\n\n\nMethods\nWe present a comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS, based on an integrated dataset with 3,336 SARS patients from Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan, epidemiological and clinical characteristics such as incubation, onset-to-admission, onset-to-discharge and onset-to-death periods, case fatality ratios (CFRs) and presenting symptoms are described and compared between regions.\n\n We further explored the influence of demographic and clinical variables on the apparently large differences in CFRs between the three regions.\n\n\nResults\nAll three regions showed similar incubation periods and progressive shortening of the onset-to-admission interval through the epidemic.\n\n Adjusted for sex, health care worker status and nosocomial setting, older age was associated with a higher fatality, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.45, 3.04) for those aged 51-60; AOR: 4.57 (95% confidence interval: 3.32, 7.30) for those aged above 60 compared to those aged 41-50 years.\n\n Presence of pre-existing comorbid conditions was also associated with greater mortality (AOR: 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.36, 2.21).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe large discrepancy in crude fatality ratios across the three regions can only be partly explained by epidemiological and clinical heterogeneities.\n\n Our findings underline the importance of a common data collection platform, especially in an emerging epidemic, in order to identify and explain consistencies and differences in the eventual clinical and public health outcomes of infectious disease outbreaks, which is becoming increasingly important in our highly interconnected world.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2846944","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

by interspecies transmission.\n Considering the diversity of bat coronaviruses, bat species and populations, we expect to discover more bat CoVs through virus surveillance.\n In this study, we described a new member of alphaCoV (BtCoV/Rh/YN2012) in bats with unique genome features.\n Unique accessory genes, ORF4a and ORF4b were found between the spike gene and the envelope gene, while ORF8 gene was found downstream of the nucleocapsid gene.\n All the putative genes were further confirmed by reverse-transcription analyses.\n One unique gene at the 3 end of the BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 genome, ORF9, exhibits ~30% amino acid identity to ORF7a of the SARS-related coronavirus.\n Functional analysis showed ORF4a protein can activate IFN-? production, whereas ORF3a can regulate NF-?B production.\n We also screened the spike-mediated virus entry using the spike-pseudotyped retroviruses system, although failed to find any fully permissive cells.\n Our results expand the knowledge on the genetic diversity of bat coronaviruses.\n Continuous screening of bat viruses will help us further understand the important role played by bats in coronavirus evolution and

2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

detected in ACE2+ cells in the lungs and other organs, indicating that ACE2?expressing cells are the primary targets for SARS?CoV infection in vivo in humans.\n High levels of PICs were expressed in the SARS?CoV?infected ACE2+ cells, but not in the uninfected cells.\n These results suggest that cells infected by SARS?CoV produce elevated levels of PICs which may cause immuno?mediated damage to the lungs and other organs, resulting in ALI and, subsequently, multi?organ dysfunction.\n Therefore application of PIC antagonists may reduce the severity and mortality of SARS.\n Copyright © 2006

Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.\n One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses.\n Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV.\n This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.\n","id":"PMC7081895","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Yushun","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rachel","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Gallagher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Gallagher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/eci.13209","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel Chinese coronavirus (2019?nCoV) infections: Challenges for fighting the storm","abstract":"","id":"PMC7163647","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Matteo","surname":"Bassetti","email":"matteo.bassetti@unige.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Vena","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniele Roberto","surname":"Giacobbe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.tim.2016.03.003","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiology, Genetic Recombination, and Pathogenesis of Coronaviruses","abstract":"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first described in the 1960s for patients with the common cold.\n Since then, more HCoVs have been discovered, including those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), two pathogens that, upon infection, can cause fatal respiratory disease in humans.\n It was recently discovered that dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia harbor three different HCoV species, including a dominant MERS HCoV lineage that was responsible for the outbreaks in the Middle East and South Korea during 2015.

(TGF-?)-induced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 but attenuates Smad3/Smad4-mediated apoptosis of human peripheral lung epithelial HPL1 cells.\n The promoting effect of N protein on the transcriptional responses of TGF-? is Smad3-specific.\n N protein associates with Smad3 and promotes Smad3-p300 complex formation while it interferes with the complex formation between Smad3 and Smad4. These findings provide evidence of a novel mechanism whereby N protein modulates TGF-? signaling to block apoptosis of SARS-CoV-infected host cells and meanwhile promote tissue fibrosis.\n Our results reveal a novel mode of Smad3 action in a Smad4-independent manner and may lead to successful strategies for SARS treatment by targeting the TGF-? signaling molecules.\n","id":"PMC8740907","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"ASBMB.

These genes differ distinctly among the three coronavirus groups and are specific for each group.\n While the essential genes encode replication and structural functions, hardly anything is known about the products and functions of the group-specific genes.\n As a first step to elucidate their significance, we deleted the group-specific genes from the group 2 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome via a novel targeted recombination system based on host switching (L.\n Kuo, G.\n J.\nGodeke, M.\n J.\n Raamsman, P.\n S.\n Masters, and P.\n J.\n M.\n Rottier, 2000, J.\n Virol.\n 74, 13931406).\n Thus, we obtained recombinant viruses from which the two clusters of group-specific genes were deleted either separately or in combination in a controlled genetic background.\n As all recombinant deletion mutant viruses appeared to be viable, we conclude that the MHV group-specific genes are nonessential, accessory genes.\n Importantly, all deletion mutant viruses were attenuated when inoculated into their natural host, the mouse.\n Therefore, deletion of the coronavirus group-specific genes seems to provide an attractive approach to generate attenuated live coronavirus

to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases (bringing the total number of SARS-CoV proteins to 28).\n A phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene, using a distantly related torovirus as

group 2 coronaviruses, with four of them being conserved in SARS-CoV.\n These newly recognized viral enzymes place the mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis in a completely new perspective.\n

Efficacy in Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoVchallenged mice.\n\n VRP-Ninduced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Mouse-Adapted SARS-Coronavirus Causes Disease and Mortality in BALB/c Mice","abstract":"No single animal model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reproduces all aspects of the human disease.\n Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals.\n","id":"PMC1769406","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

respiratory disease, SARS, with significant mortality.\n Although factors contributing to the highly pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV remain poorly understood, it has been reported that SARS-CoV infection does not induce type I interferons (IFNs) in cell culture.\n However, it is uncertain whether SARS-CoV evades host detection or has evolved mechanisms to counteract innate host defenses.\n We show here that infection of SARS-CoV triggers a weak IFN response in cultured human lung/bronchial epithelial cells without inducing the phosphorylation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a latent cellular transcription factor that is pivotal for type I IFN synthesis.\n Furthermore, SARS-CoV infection blocked the induction of IFN antiviral activity and the up-regulation of protein expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes triggered by double-stranded RNA or an unrelated paramyxovirus.\n In searching for a SARS-CoV protein capable of counteracting innate immunity, we identified the papain-like protease (PLpro) domain as a potent IFN antagonist.\n The inhibition of the IFN response does not require the protease activity of PLpro.\n Rather, PLpro interacts with IRF-3 and inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3, thereby disrupting the activation of type I IFN responses through either Toll-like receptor 3 or retinoic acid-inducible gene I/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 pathways.\n Our data suggest that regulation of IRF-3-dependent innate antiviral defenses by PLpro may contribute to the establishment of SARS-CoV

Distinct glial cell cytokine and chemokine response patterns were observed within 3 days after infection, became progressively more polarized during the course of infection and with the infiltration of leukocytes.\n In the brain, MHV-JHM infection induced strong accumulation of IFN? mRNA relative to IFN? mRNA.\n This trend was reversed in MHV-A59 infection and was accompanied by increased CD8 T cell infiltration into brain compared to MHV-JHM infection.\n Increased apoptosis appeared to contribute to the diminished presence of CD8 T cells in MHV-JHM-infected brain with the consequence of a lower potential for IFN? production and antiviral activity.\n MHV-JHM infection also induced sustained mRNA accumulation of the innate immune response products interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1. Furthermore, high levels of macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1?, MIP-1?, and MIP-2 mRNA were observed at the onset of MHV-JHM infection and correlated with a marked elevation in the number of

the ability of the virus to circumvent innate immunity.\n Using functional genomics, we analyzed early host responses to SARS-CoV infection in the lungs of adolescent cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that show lung pathology similar to that observed in human adults with SARS.\n Analysis of gene signatures revealed induction of a strong innate immune response characterized by the stimulation of various cytokine and chemokine genes, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IP-10, which corresponds to the host response seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n As opposed to many in vitro experiments, SARS-CoV induced a wide range of type I interferons (IFNs) and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in the lungs of macaques.\n Using immunohistochemistry, we revealed that these antiviral signaling pathways were differentially regulated in distinctive subsets of cells.\n Our studies emphasize that the induction of early IFN signaling may be critical to confer protection against SARS-CoV infection and highlight the strength of combining functional genomics with immunohistochemistry to further unravel the

effectiveness of treatment options.\n\n The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nIn response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients.\n\n We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria.\n\n In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria.\n\n Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture.\n\n In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm.\n\n Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive.\n\n In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm.\n\n\nConclusions\nDespite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak.\n\n Some may have been harmful.\n\n Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and to accrue data in real time during future outbreaks to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1564166","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Lauren

Radiolabeling with carbohydrate precursors and borate gel electrophoresis of glycopeptides show that different oligcsaccharide side chains are attached to El and E2. The two coronavirus envelope glycoproteins thus appear to be glycosylated by different mechanisms.\n In tunicamycin-treated cells, noninfectious virions lacking peplomers are formed at intracytoplasmic membranes and released from the cells.\n These virions contain normal amounts of nucleocapsid protein and glycosylated El, but lack E2. Thus the transmembrane glycoprotein El is the only viral glycoprotein required for the formation of the viral envelope or for virus maturation and release.\n The peplomeric glycoprotein E2 appears to be required for attachment to virus receptors on the plasma membrane.\n The coronavirus envelope envelope glycoprotein E1 appears to be a novel type of viral glycoprotein which is post-translationally glycosylated by a tunicamycin-resistant process that yields oligosaccharide side chains different from those of N-linked glycoproteins.\n These findings suggest that El may be particularly useful as a

(SARSCoV).\n\n We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

but the pathogenesis is still unclear.\n\n\nMethods\nPost-mortem tissue samples from six patients who died from SARS in February and March, 2003, and an open lung biopsy from one of these patients were studied by histology and virology.\n\n Only one full autopsy was done.\n\n Evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human metapneumovirus was sought by reverse-transcriptase PCR and serology.\n\n Pathological samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\n\n\nFindings\nAll six patients had serological evidence of recent infection with SARS-CoV.\n\n Diffuse alveolar damage was common but not universal.\n\n Morphological changes identified were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia.\n\n Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case.\n\n A giant-cell infiltrate was seen in four patients, with a pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung.\n\n Haemophagocytosis was present in two patients.\n\n The alveolar pneumocytes also showed cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm.\n\n The patient for whom full autopsy was done had atrophy of the white pulp of the spleen.\n\n Electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells corresponding to coronavirus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nSARS is associated with epithelial-cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages in the lung.\n\n The presence of haemophagocytosis supports the contention that cytokine dysregulation may account, at least partly, for the severity of the clinical disease.\n\n The case definition of SARS should acknowledge the range of lung pathology associated with this

China","abstract":"In order to investigate the clinical pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the autopsies of three patients who died from SARS in Nan Fang Hospital Guangdong, China were studied retrospectively.\n Routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to study all of the tissues from the three cases.\n The lung tissue specimens were studied further with Macchiavello staining, viral inclusion body staining, reticulin staining, PAS staining, immunohistochemistry, ultrathin sectioning and staining, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.\n The first symptom was hyperpyrexia in all three cases, followed by progressive dyspnoea and lung field shadowing.\n The pulmonary lesions included bilateral extensive consolidation, localized haemorrhage and necrosis, desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis, proliferation and desquamation of alveolar epithelial cells, exudation of protein and monocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells in alveoli, hyaline membrane formation, and viral inclusion bodies in alveolar epithelial cells.\n There was also massive necrosis of splenic lymphoid tissue and localized necrosis in lymph nodes.\n Systemic vasculitis included oedema, localized fibrinoid necrosis, and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and the stroma of striated muscles.\n Thrombosis was present in small veins.\n Systemic toxic changes included degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and adrenal gland.\n Electron microscopy demonstrated clusters of viral particles, consistent with coronavirus, in lung tissue.\n SARS is a systemic disease that injures many organs.\n The lungs, immune organs, and systemic small vessels are the main targets of virus attack, so that extensive consolidation of the lung, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, respiratory distress, and decreased immune function are the main causes of death.\n Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons,

novel coronavirus (CoV).\n Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with SARS but the significance remains undetermined.\n Herein, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and virologic features of the intestinal involvement of this new viral infection.\n Methods: A retrospective analysis of the gastrointestinal symptoms and other clinical parameters of the first 138 patients with confirmed SARS admitted for a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003 was performed.\n Intestinal specimens were obtained by colonoscopy or postmortem examination to detect the presence of coronavirus by electron microscopy, virus culture, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n Results: Among these 138 patients with SARS, 28 (20.3%) presented with watery diarrhea and up to 38.4% of patients had symptoms of diarrhea during the course of illness.\n Diarrhea was more frequently observed during the first week of illness.\n The mean number of days with diarrhea was 3.7 ± 2.7, and most diarrhea was self-limiting.\n Intestinal biopsy specimens obtained by colonoscopy or autopsy showed minimal architectural disruption but the presence of active viral replication within both the small and large intestine.\n Coronavirus was also isolated by culture from these specimens, and SARS-CoV RNA can be detected in the stool of patients for more than 10 weeks after symptom onset.\n Conclusions: Diarrhea is a common presenting symptom of SARS.\n The intestinal tropism of the SARS-CoV has major implications on clinical presentation and viral transmission.\n","id":"PMC7126982","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Gastroenterological Association.

Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently present in these cancers, and some of the aberrantly methylated genes are causally involved in cancer development and progression.\n Notably, aberrant DNA methylation can be present even in non-cancerous or precancerous tissues, and its levels correlate with the risk of cancer development, producing a so-called epigenetic field for cancerization.\n Mechanistically, most viral or bacterial infections induce DNA methylation indirectly via chronic inflammation, but recent studies have indicated that some viruses have direct effects on the epigenetic machinery of host cells.\n From a translational viewpoint, a recent multicenter prospective cohort study demonstrated that assessment of the extent of alterations in DNA methylation in non-cancerous tissues can be used to predict cancer risk.\n Furthermore, suppression of aberrant DNA methylation was shown to be a useful strategy for cancer prevention in an animal model.\n Here, we review the involvement of aberrant DNA methylation in various types of infection-associated cancers, along with individual induction mechanisms, and we discuss the application of these findings for

pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

world on alert.\n 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.\n One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses.\n Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV.\n This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel

patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n We postulated that repleting ACE2 using GSK2586881, a recombinant form of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2), could attenuate acute lung injury.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We conducted a two-part phase II trial comprising an open-label intrapatient dose escalation and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase in ten intensive care units in North America.\n\n Patients were between the ages of 18 and 80 years, had an American-European Consensus Criteria consensus diagnosis of ARDS, and had been mechanically ventilated for less than 72 h.\n\n In part A, open-label GSK2586881 was administered at doses from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.8 mg/kg to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.\n\n Following review of data from part A, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of twice-daily doses of GSK2586881 (0.4 mg/kg) for 3 days was conducted (part B).\n\n Biomarkers, physiological assessments, and clinical endpoints were collected over the dosing period and during follow-up.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Dose escalation in part A was well-tolerated without clinically significant hemodynamic changes.\n\n Part B was terminated after 39 of the planned 60 patients following a planned futility analysis.\n\n Angiotensin II levels decreased rapidly following infusion of GSK2586881, whereas angiotensin-(17) and angiotensin-(15) levels increased and remained elevated for 48 h.\n\n Surfactant protein D concentrations were increased, whereas there was a trend for a decrease in interleukin-6 concentrations in rhACE2-treated subjects compared with placebo.\n\n No significant differences were noted in ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen, oxygenation index, or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>GSK2586881 was well-tolerated in patients with ARDS, and the rapid modulation of RAS peptides suggests target engagement, although the study was not powered to detect changes in acute physiology or clinical outcomes.\n\n\nTrial registration\nid='Par5'>ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov,

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health13.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020.

was to look for the warning index in severe COVID?19 patients.\n We investigated 43 adult patients with COVID?19. The patients were classified into mild group (28 patients) and severe group (15 patients).\n A comparison of the hematological parameters between the mild and severe groups showed significant differences in interleukin?6 (IL?6), d?dimer (d?D), glucose, thrombin time, fibrinogen, and C?reactive protein (P?&lt;?.\n05).\n The optimal threshold and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) of IL?6 were 24.3 and 0.795?µg/L, respectively, while those of d?D were 0.28 and 0.750?µg/L, respectively.\n The area under the ROC curve of IL?6 combined with d?D was 0.840. The specificity of predicting the severity of COVID?19 during IL?6 and d?D tandem testing was up to 93.3%, while the sensitivity of IL?6 and d?D by parallel test in the severe COVID?19 was 96.4%.\n IL?6 and d?D were closely related to the occurrence of severe COVID?19 in the adult patients, and their combined detection had the highest specificity and sensitivity for early prediction of the severity of COVID?19 patients, which has important clinical value.\n","id":"PMC7228247","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

serious outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.\n\n Related clinical features are needed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan between January 16 to January 29, 2020. All patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020.\nResults\nThe median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients (46%) were men.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]), cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]).\n\n Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients).\n\n As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%.\n\n According to the lowest SpO2 during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2?90% group (n=55) and the SpO2&lt;90% group (n=14).\n\n All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2&lt;90% group.\n\n Compared with SpO2?90% group, patients of the SpO2&lt;90% group were older, and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c reactive protein.\n\n Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate.\n\n\nConclusions\nCOVID-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5%.\n\n Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184452","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhongliang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bohan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianwen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Wen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiguang","surname":"Zhang","email":"zrg27@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s12519-020-00354-4","date":"2020-03-02","title":"Clinical features of severe pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan: a single centers observational study","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China.\n\n People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n No information on severe pediatric patients with COVID-19 has been reported.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Childrens Hospital from January 24 to February 24.

coronavirus (MERS-CoV) remains poorly understood.\n In a previous study, we established an hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mouse model in which MERS-CoV infection causes severe acute respiratory failure and high mortality accompanied by an elevated secretion of cytokines and chemokines.\n Since excessive complement activation is an important factor that contributes to acute lung injury after viral infection, in this study, we investigated the role of complement in MERS-CoV-induced lung damage.\n Our study showed that complement was excessively activated in MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-Tg mice through observations of increased concentrations of the C5a and C5b-9 complement activation products in sera and lung tissues, respectively.\n Interestingly, blocking C5a production by targeting its receptor, C5aR, alleviated lung and spleen tissue damage and reduced inflammatory responses.\n More importantly, anti-C5aR antibody treatment led to decreased viral replication in lung tissues.\n Furthermore, compared with the sham treatment control, apoptosis of splenic cells was less pronounced in the splenic white pulp of treated mice, and greater number of proliferating splenic cells, particularly in the red pulp, was observed.\n These data indicate that (1) dysregulated host immune responses contribute to the severe outcome of MERS; (2) excessive complement activation, triggered by MERS-CoV infection, promote such dysregulation; and (3) blockade of the C5aC5aR axis lead to the decreased tissue damage induced by MERS-CoV infection, as manifested by reduced apoptosis and T cell regeneration in the spleen.\n Therefore, the results of this study suggest a new strategy for clinical intervention and adjunctive treatment in MERS-CoV

have demonstrated that the host complement system contributes to development of disease.\n In this study, we have used a mouse model of RRV-induced disease to identify and characterize which complement activation pathways mediate disease progression after infection, and we have identified the mannose binding lectin (MBL) pathway, but not the classical or alternative complement activation

disease, tissue damage, and complement deposition compared to wild-type mice.\n In contrast, mice deficient for key components of the classical or alternative complement activation pathways still developed severe RRV-induced disease.\n Further characterization of MBL deficient mice demonstrated that similar to C3?/? mice, viral replication and inflammatory cell recruitment were equivalent to wild type animals, suggesting that RRV-mediated induction of complement dependent immune pathology is largely MBL dependent.\n Consistent with these findings, human patients diagnosed with RRV disease had elevated serum MBL levels compared to healthy controls, and MBL levels in the serum and synovial fluid correlated with severity of disease.\n These findings demonstrate a role for MBL in promoting RRV-induced disease in both mice and humans and suggest that the MBL pathway of complement activation may be an effective target for therapeutic intervention for humans suffering from RRV-induced

member in the family Coronaviridae.\n To evaluate the lung pathology in this life-threatening respiratory illness, we studied postmortem lung sections from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak.\n The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage.\n The histology varied according to the duration of illness.\n Cases of 10 or fewer days duration demonstrated acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin.\n Cases of more than 10 days duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia.\n In acute-phase DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes.\n Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and CD68 staining.\n SARS-CoV RNA was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue, including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue.\n Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies.\n Further studies of the pathogenesis of SARS may reveal new insight into the mechanisms of DAD.\n","id":"PMC7119137","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Teri

BALB/c Mice","abstract":"No single animal model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reproduces all aspects of the human disease.\n Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals.\n","id":"PMC1769406","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of
