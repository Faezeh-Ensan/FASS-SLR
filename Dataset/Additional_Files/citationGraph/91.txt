The COVID-19 outbreak has undoubtedly resulted in increased difficulties among ASD individuals. \n1. Introduction\nAfter the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus outbreak of 2002-2003, the International Health Regulations (IHR) of the World Health Organization (WHO), which had been first adopted in 1969, were revised in 2005 to extend their scope to any public health risk that might affect human health, irrespective of the source. Emphasis was put on the risk that the increasing international travel and trade could facilitate the international spread of disease, requiring a coordinated international response. Since the 2005 IHR adoption, the WHO has formally declared six Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC), the latter of which, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is still ongoing. COVID-19 is caused by a newly identified coronavirus which can induce SARS in man (SARS-CoV-2), as a consequence of a probable zoonotic spillover, firstly reported in Central China in December 2019. Due to person-to-person transmission, it has rapidly spread in Europe, with northern Italy becoming Europe's epicenter, and USA. As of 1 May 2020, over 3 million cases have been reported worldwide, affecting more than 200 countries.\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, most clinical and research efforts have been allocated to advance our understanding of the virus properties and pathogenic armory in order to treat the infection and protect from it. However, according to some research evidence, the COVID-19 pandemic is also unraveling a potential gap in mental health services during emergencies. In particular, the COVID-19 outbreak would result in higher levels of psychological distress among the general population as well as a higher risk or symptom exacerbation among people suffering from a pre-existing mental health condition, possibly triggered by concerns about its rapid escalation and global spread as a deadly threat. Furthermore, alarming media reports may unintendedly amplify fear reactions, with potential detrimental consequences for people susceptible to negative emotional states. Importantly, the pandemic has required unprecedented measures by national governments including imposing quarantine to citizens. The experience of being quarantined may be negative, as evidence suggests a wide range of long-lasting mental health problems in a substantial proportion of individuals. While there is no strong evidence that any particular demographic factors carry a higher risk of poor psychological outcome following the obligation of home quarantine, a pre-existing psychiatric history seems to predict a worse outcome and a higher need for support during quarantine. \nAmong vulnerable populations, young individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are of particular concern for the impact that the COVID-19 outbreak may have on their wellbeing as well as the specific support they may need to preserve their mental health through the pandemic. ASD are a group of conditions characterized by social communication problems, difficulties with reciprocal social interactions, and unusual patterns of repetitive behavior. Such features are associated with a preference for highly predictable environments, whereas ASD individuals may feel stressed, anxious or confused if unpredictable or complex changes occur. The COVID-19 outbreak has undoubtedly led to a quick-paced and rapidly shifting social situation which may increase ASD individuals' difficulties.\nThe purpose of this study was threefold. The main aim was to rapidly investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on ASD individuals through an online parent survey carried in Northern Italy, one of the European regions mostly affected. Due to the ASD individuals' difficulty to deal with the unexpected, a mainly unfavorable psychosocial and behavioral outcome was hypothesized. A further aim was to investigate whether any pre-pandemic sociodemographic or clinical characteristics would predict a negative impact of the pandemic on ASD individuals' wellbeing. Based on previous evidence, psychological problems predating the emergency were hypothesized to predict a poor outcome. Finally, the survey served to characterize the needs of ASD individuals and their families from a narrative perspective, by collecting the parents' perceptions, as a first step to improving their quality of health care.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Research Design\nGoogle Forms was used to create an online parent survey to be shared through the dissemination of a hyperlink. The survey was available online from the 6 April to the 20 April 2020. All participants provided electronic informed consent that contained information about the purpose of the study, procedures, benefits of participating, voluntary participation, and contact information of the researchers. The survey was part of a larger study which was approved by the research ethics committee at the Integrated University Hospital of Verona (CESC 2242 and CESC 2243). \n2.2. Participants\nParents and guardians of individuals with an ASD diagnosis were asked by healthcare professionals affiliated with the Veneto Autism Spectrum Disorder Regional Centre at the Integrated University Hospital of Verona to fill out the online survey. Autism advocacy and family support networks were additionally used to distribute and directly encourage survey participation. Children' ASD diagnosis was self-reported.\n2.3. Instrument\nThe parent survey was developed by a focus group of physicians, psychologists, and child life specialists, also taking the advice from parents of children with ASD. The survey consisted of 40 questions (18 multiple choice questions, 20 yes/no questions, and 2 open-response questions) in 3 categories: (i) ASD individuals' socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, (ii) impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on their wellbeing, and (iii) needs to deal with the emergency. Participants were allowed to select only 1 item for each multiple-choice question. \n2.4. Analyses\nThe final raw data were downloaded from Google Forms into a Microsoft Excel file for analysis using SPSS software (Version 26.0; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to provide baseline information concerning survey participants' ASD children. Then, multiple logistic regressions were performed to investigate whether any ASD individuals' socio-demographic or clinical characteristics would predict a greater frequency and intensity of behavior problems following the COVID-19 outbreak. \nThe open-response questions did not have a scoring system. The needs identified by the survey responses were gathered with the intent of informing healthcare professionals in their assessment and management of individuals with an ASD diagnosis during the ongoing COVID-19 emergency. Two authors independently evaluated such answers and pooled them into categories (e.g., healthcare, social, financial needs, etc.). In the rare instances of discrepant category attribution, consensus was reached through discussion with a third senior clinical researcher.\nThe survey was not intended to formally assess severity of ASD among participants' children.\n3. Results\nA total of 529 respondents participated in the survey. As 2 participants did not answer any questions at all, a total of 527 participants were included in the study. Across the 38 closed questions, survey participants provided 18,738 answers, while 373 answers were missing (&lt;2%). Further, 34 answers and 1 missing item were deemed inconsistent (&lt;0.2%) and excluded from the final analyses.\n3.1. Socio-Demographic and Clinical Characteristics\nThe mean age of participants' children was 13 years (SD = 8.1). Almost all of them were from the Veneto region (99.4%) and the large majority were living in married or cohabiting couple families (88.2%). Most children had at least 1 sibling (71.6%), and one out every 10 siblings had a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) diagnosis (10.2%). Most children were receiving private therapy (66.2%) and most parents were members of autism advocacy and family support networks (67.1%) (Table 1). \nOnly one every three children had a fluent language (33.1%). About half of the entire sample was presenting with behavior problems from before the outbreak of COVID-19 (51.5%); among those, 42.2% were receiving pharmacological treatment. At least 1 comorbid medical condition was reported in 27.8% of ASD individuals, with neuromotor and gastrointestinal conditions and allergies and food sensitivity being the conditions most frequently reported (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). \n3.2. Psychosocial and Behavioral Impact of the Emergency Outbreak\nCOVID-19 positivity was reported among 1.3% of nuclear family members and 4.4% of extended family members, with bereavement occurring in 2.3% of cases. Approximately one out of four parents stopped working due the emergency outbreak (26.1% of mothers and 27.5% of fathers). The large majority of them evaluated the current period of change and restrictions as challenging or very challenging (93.9%) and more challenging than before the emergency outbreak (77%) (Table 2).\nFollowing the emergency outbreak, a proportion of parents reported support from the Local Healthcare Services (27.7%), with the large majority of them reporting both direct (70.1%; e.g., calls, videocalls) and indirect (84%; e.g., text messages, homework assignments) school support as well as support from the private therapist (73.3%). For each type of support, an only slightly lower proportion of parents considered it from sufficiently useful to very useful during the ongoing emergency (Table 2).\nA proportion of parents reported difficulties in managing their child's meals (23%), autonomies (31%), free time (78.1%), and structured activities (75.7%). For each activity, an almost overlapping proportion of parents reported such activity as more difficult than before the emergency outbreak. Overall, compared to before the emergency outbreak, behavior problems were reported being more intense (35.5%) and more frequent (41.5%) in a substantial proportion of ASD individuals. Due to the onset of behavior problems, an emergency contact with the child's Neuropsychiatrist was required in 19.1% of cases, while an access to the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) happened in 1.5% of cases (Table 2).\n3.3. Predictors of Emergency Outbreak Negative Impact on Wellbeing\nA multiple logistic regression tested for an effect of (i) behavior problems predating the emergency (yes/no), (ii) age, (iii) language (fluent/non-fluent), (iv) being an only child (yes/no) as a proxy of greater social isolation in quarantine, (v) medical comorbidity (yes/no), (vi) parenting couple situation (married or cohabiting/separated or single parent), (vii) support by Local Healthcare Services since COVID-19 (yes/no), (viii) direct school support since COVID-19 (yes/no), (ix) indirect school support since COVID-19 (yes/no), (x) private therapist support since COVID-19 (yes/no or no private therapist from before COVID-19) on the intensity of the behavior problems following the emergency outbreak (more intense/equally or less intense). The logistic regression model was statistically significant, chi2 (10, N = 440) = 32.338, p &lt; 0.001. ASD individuals with preexisting behavior problems were 2.16 times more likely to exhibit more intense behavior problems that those without preexisting behavior problems. Increasing age and living with a separated or single parent were associated with a reduction in the likelihood of exhibiting more intense behavior problems, while not receiving indirect school support during the emergency tended to be associated with an increased likelihood of exhibiting more intense behavior problems (Table 3).\nA further multiple logistic regression tested for the effect of (i) behavior problems predating the emergency (yes/no), (ii) age, (iii) language (fluent/non-fluent), (iv) being an only child (yes/no), (v) medical comorbidity (yes/no), (vi) parenting couple situation (married or cohabiting/separated or single parent), (vii) support by Local Healthcare Services since COVID-19 (yes/no), (viii) direct school support since COVID-19 (yes/no), (ix) indirect school support since COVID-19 (yes/no), (x) private therapist support since COVID-19 (yes/no or no private therapist from before COVID-19) on the frequency of the behavior problems following the emergency outbreak (more frequent/equally or less frequent). The logistic regression model was statistically significant, chi2 (10, N = 444) = 18.502, p = 0.047. ASD individuals with preexisting behavior problems were 1.67 times more likely to exhibit more frequent behavior problems that those without preexisting behavior problems (Table 4).\n3.4. Needs to Deal with the Emergency: A Narrative Perspective\nOut of 527 survey participants, 406 parents (77%) reported at least one need to the open-response question about what could be of help do deal with the ongoing emergency. Ten of them reported more than one need (4 participants reported 2 needs, 6 participants reported 3 needs), for a total of 422 responses. The most commonly reported need was for in-home healthcare support (29.9%), followed by center-based healthcare support (10.4%), loosening quarantine restrictions (9.7%), ending lockdown (7.1%), and in-hospital healthcare support (7.1%; Table 5).\n4. Discussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study which systematically explored the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in a population of individuals suffering from an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Results from this parent survey indicate that the large majority of parents of ASD individuals consider the period of change and restrictions that has followed the onset of the emergency as challenging and requiring more commitment than before. Most support was delivered by school services, followed by private therapists and local healthcare services. Consistent with previous reports of executive functioning deficits making ASD individuals more vulnerable to routine disruption, an elevated number of parents reported difficulties in managing their children's daily activities, especially in terms of free time and structured activities. Despite requiring specialist intervention in a relatively small proportion of cases, and almost never ending in hospital emergency assessments, behavior problems worsened in more than one third of ASD individuals. \nIn line with previous evidence that pre-existing psychological difficulties seem to be the only clear predictor of poorer mental health outcomes following respiratory syndromes and quarantine, the most relevant finding of this survey is that ASD individuals with behavior problems predating the COVID-19 outbreak are twice as likely to experience more intense and more frequent behavior problems since the beginning of the emergency. As independent evidence supports decreasing symptom levels from childhood to young adulthood in ASD, especially in verbally fluent individuals, we also tested whether the age and language level of survey participants' children with ASD would predict a worsening of the behavior problems. Results suggest that older age may play a protective role with regards to the emergency-induced intensification of behavior problems, while the effect of language failed to reach statistical significance. Furthermore, despite social isolation and mental health problems may co-occur in childhood, as well as medical conditions and ASD, being an only child, as a proxy of greater social isolation, and comorbid medical conditions did not predict a poorer outcome in terms of more intense or more frequent behavior problems following the COVID-19 outbreak and the implementation of restrictive measures and quarantine. Interestingly, living with a separated or single parent was associated with a better outcome in terms of intensity of behavior problems. Despite being counterintuitive, such a finding may reflect a more simplified parent-child interaction which could be effective in preventing the deterioration of the child's wellbeing during quarantine and restrictions. Future studies would need to clarify this issue. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that such evidence does not necessarily apply to other social contexts. Finally, ASD individuals not receiving school support since the COVID-19 outbreak tended to express more intense behavior problems, suggesting the importance of maintaining contact with the school during the emergency.\nThe last scope of this study was to narratively collect the parents' perceived needs through the emergency by offering an open-response question at the end of the survey. About half of the participants reported needing support from healthcare services, especially in-home services. Interestingly, almost one every five parents reported that loosening restrictions or ending the lockdown would be of help.\nOutbreaks of emerging infections such as COVID-19 can elicit strong fear reactions and preoccupations with downstream effects on physical and mental health, especially in vulnerable individuals. Moreover, such negative impacts on health could be worsened by the experience of being quarantined. Autism is no exception. Even though it is a complex genetic disorder, the effect of the environment in shaping the behavioral phenotype should not be underestimated. In fact, a high emotional climate, such as that resulting from the COVID-19 emergency outbreak, has been associated with increased levels of maladaptive behavior in ASD over time. Furthermore, families of individuals with ASD have been reported to experience greater stress than families whose children suffer from other disabilities, making a compelling case for the implementation of youth-oriented mental health prevention and early intervention strategies. Evidence supports the effectiveness of such interventions in mitigating disabilities and even improving skills among young individuals with ASD.\nSurveys performed during previous Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC) have provided timely data to inform best practices in responding to the emergency. Similarly, the online survey presented here has proved to be a powerful data collection tool, benefiting from the strengths that have been associated to this type of instrument such as having a large sample size, fast response times, timely data processing, and low costs. Moreover, thanks to the solid infrastructure of autism advocacy and family support networks, we were able to mitigate the risk of poor response rates and improve sample representativeness, collecting data from over five hundred ASD individuals and their families in a catchment area (the Veneto Region) of about 5 million people. However, the findings of this study have to be seen in light of some limitations. In particular, in spite of the aforementioned advantages, the survey suffered from the lack of a standardized assessment of clinical features such as language and behavior problems. Such aspects may limit the comparability of outcomes among different studies as well as internal comparisons in any follow-up assessments. Furthermore, despite collecting information on children's language and behavior problems predating the emergency as a proxy of their baseline cognitive and adaptive functioning, due to its nature, the online survey did not allow investigating such aspects through a standard method such as psychometric tests. Furthermore, information on the gender of ASD children was not available through the online survey. Even though the main aim of the study was not to investigate gender differences in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in ASD, we acknowledge the limitation. \nIn conclusion, the present survey indicates that the ongoing COVID-19 emergency has resulted in a challenging period for most ASD individuals and their families, with increased difficulties in managing daily activities and at least one in every three children presenting with more frequent or more intense behavior problems. Children with behavior problems predating the COVID-19 outbreak were found to be particularly at risk to present with more intense and more frequent disruptive behavior. Even though ASD children were receiving different types of support, also requiring specialist or emergency interventions in a relatively low proportion of cases, a number of needs emerged, including receiving more healthcare support, especially from in-home services, as well as interventions to tackle a potentially disruptive quarantine.\nSupplementary Materials\nThe following are available online at .

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team, Li Q.

In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.\n\n Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date.\n\n Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure.\n\n Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested.\n\n\nFindings\nPatient 1—a woman in her 60s—returned from China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but had frequent close contact with his wife.\n\n He was admitted 8 days later and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347 underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195 health-care personnel.\n\n Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under investigation, in addition to Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.\nInterpretation\nPerson-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic.\n\n Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of symptomatic and some asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158585","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

In these situations, individuals may seek information from unofficial channels (e.\ng.\n, social media), thereby exposing themselves to unverified information and rumors.\n In a study of students

reported greater distress.\n Then, using a big-data analysis of Twitter data spanning ?5 hours surrounding the event, we demonstrated that rumor transmission tracks with community-level negative

A total of 57 articles were included for full-text analysis.\n Overall, we observe an increasing trend in published articles on health-related misinformation and the role of social media in its propagation.\n The most extensively studied topics involving misinformation relate to vaccination, Ebola and Zika Virus, although others, such as nutrition, cancer, fluoridation of water and smoking also featured.\n Studies adopted theoretical frameworks from psychology and network science, while co-citation analysis revealed potential for greater collaboration across fields.\n Most studies employed content analysis, social network analysis or experiments, drawing on disparate disciplinary paradigms.\n Future research should examine susceptibility of different sociodemographic groups to misinformation and understand the role of belief systems on the intention to spread misinformation.\n Further interdisciplinary research is also warranted to identify effective and tailored interventions to counter the spread of health-related misinformation online.\n","id":"PMC7117034","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Authors.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","abstract":"OBJECTIVES\nIsolation due to the management of infectious diseases is thought to affect mental health, but the effects are still unknown.\n\n We examined the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and anger in persons isolated during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic both at isolation period and at four to six months after release from isolation.\n\n We also determined risk factors associated with these symptoms at four to six months.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOf 14,992 individuals isolated for 2-week due to having contact with MERS patients in 2015, when MERS was introduced to Korea, 1,692 individuals were included in this study.\n\n Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and anger was assessed with the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory at four to six months after release from isolation for MERS.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 1,692 who came in contact with MERS patients, 1,656 were not diagnosed with MERS.\n\n Among 1,656, anxiety symptoms showed 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3 to 8.9%) and feelings of anger were present in 16.6% (95% CI, 14.8 to 18.4%) during the isolation period.\n\n At four to six months after release from isolation, anxiety symptoms were observed in 3.0% (95%CI, 2.2 to 3.9%).\n\n Feelings of anger were present in 6.4% (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.6%).\n\n Risk factors for experiencing anxiety symptoms and anger at four to six months after release included symptoms related to MERS during isolation, inadequate supplies (food, clothes, accommodation), social networking activities (email, text, Internet), history of psychiatric illnesses, and financial loss.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMental health problems at four to six month after release from isolation might be prevented by providing mental health support to individuals with vulnerable mental health, and providing accurate information as well as appropriate supplies, including food, clothes, and accommodation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5177805","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Korean Society of

Comorbid Medical Conditions: An Integrative Review","abstract":"Co-occurring medical disorders and associated physiological abnormalities in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may provide insight into causal pathways or underlying biological mechanisms.\n Here, we review medical conditions that have been repeatedly highlighted as sharing the strongest associations with ASD—epilepsy, sleep, as well as gastrointestinal and immune functioning.\n We describe within each condition their prevalence, associations with behavior, and evidence for successful treatment.\n We additionally discuss research aiming to uncover potential aetiological mechanisms.\n We then consider the potential interaction between each group of conditions and ASD and, based on the available evidence, propose a model that integrates these medical comorbidities in relation to potential shared aetiological mechanisms.\n Future research should aim to systematically examine the interactions between these physiological systems, rather than considering these in isolation, using robust and sensitive biomarkers across an individual's development.\n A consideration of the overlap between medical conditions and ASD may aid in defining biological subtypes within ASD and in the development of specific targeted interventions.\n","id":"PMC6354568","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

(SARS-CoV-2) leading to a potentially fatal condition was discovered.\n Since then, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic.\n Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the psychological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially on vulnerable individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions.\n Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization.\n Despite being quite common, such condition remains underrecognized.\n We report a detailed clinical case of a 16 years old adolescent, who presented with a history suggestive of COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress.\n Despite testing negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, his extreme and persisting health preoccupations required an inpatient admission to the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Unit.\n He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant.\n Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD.\n When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, we highlight the importance of differentially diagnosing a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected.\n This may help preventing further burden to the healthcare system.\n","id":"PMC7166302","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Marco","surname":"Colizzi","email":"marco.colizzi@univr.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riccardo","surname":"Bortoletto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marta","surname":"Silvestri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Federica","surname":"Mondini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elena","surname":"Puttini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chiara","surname":"Cainelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rossella","surname":"Gaudino","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mirella","surname":"Ruggeri","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Leonardo","surname":"Zoccante","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References

mental health: is it time for a multidisciplinary and trans-diagnostic model for care?","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Similar to other health care sectors, mental health has moved towards the secondary prevention, with the effort to detect and treat mental disorders as early as possible.\n\n However, converging evidence sheds new light on the potential of primary preventive and promotion strategies for mental health of young people.\n\n We aimed to reappraise such evidence.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We reviewed the current state of knowledge on delivering promotion and preventive interventions addressing youth mental health.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Half of all mental disorders start by 14 years and are usually preceded by non-specific psychosocial disturbances potentially evolving in any major mental disorder and accounting for 45% of the global burden of disease across the 0–25 age span.\n\n While some action has been taken to promote the implementation of services dedicated to young people, mental health needs during this critical period are still largely unmet.\n\n This urges redesigning preventive strategies in a youth-focused multidisciplinary and trans-diagnostic framework which might early modify possible psychopathological trajectories.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Evidence suggests that it would be unrealistic to consider promotion and prevention in mental health responsibility of mental health professionals alone.\n\n Integrated and multidisciplinary services are needed to increase the range of possible interventions and limit the risk of poor long-term outcome, with also potential benefits in terms of healthcare system costs.\n\n However, mental health professionals have the scientific, ethical, and moral responsibility to indicate the direction to all social, political, and other health care bodies involved in the process of meeting mental health needs during youth years.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7092613","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Monitoring Network, 11 Sites, United States, 2018","abstract":"Problem/Condition\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD).\n\n\nPeriod Covered\n2018.\nDescription of System\nThe Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network conducts active surveillance of ASD.\n\n This report focuses on the prevalence and characteristics of ASD among children aged 8 years in 2018 whose parents or guardians lived in 11 ADDM Network sites in the United States (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin).\n\n To ascertain ASD among children aged 8 years, ADDM Network staff review and abstract developmental evaluations and records from community medical and educational service providers.\n\n In 2018, children met the case definition if their records documented 1) an ASD diagnostic statement in an evaluation (diagnosis), 2) a special education classification of ASD (eligibility), or 3) an ASD International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code.\n\n\nResults\nFor 2018, across all 11 ADDM sites, ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years ranged from 16.5 in Missouri to 38.9 in California.\n\n The overall ASD prevalence was 23.0 per 1,000 (one in 44) children aged 8 years, and ASD was 4.2 times as prevalent among boys as among girls.\n\n Overall ASD prevalence was similar across racial and ethnic groups, except American Indian/Alaska Native children had higher ASD prevalence than non-Hispanic White (White) children (29.0 versus 21.2 per 1,000 children aged 8 years).\n\n At multiple sites, Hispanic children had lower ASD prevalence than White children (Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, and Utah), and non-Hispanic Black (Black) children (Georgia and Minnesota).\n\n The associations between ASD prevalence and neighborhood-level median household income varied by site.\n\n Among the 5,058 children who met the ASD case definition, 75.8% had a diagnostic statement of ASD in an evaluation, 18.8% had an ASD special education classification or eligibility and no ASD diagnostic statement, and 5.4% had an ASD ICD code only.\n\n ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years that was based exclusively on documented ASD diagnostic statements was 17.4 overall (range: 11.2 in Maryland to 29.9 in California).\n\n The median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis ranged from 36 months in California to 63 months in Minnesota.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn 2018, one in 44 children aged 8 years was estimated to have ASD, and prevalence and median age of identification varied widely across sites.\n\n Whereas overall ASD prevalence was similar by race and ethnicity, at certain sites Hispanic children were less likely to be identified as having ASD than White or Black children.\n\n The higher proportion of Black children compared with White and Hispanic children classified as having intellectual disability was consistent with previous findings.\n\n\nPublic Health Action\nThe variability in ASD prevalence and community ASD identification practices among children with different racial, ethnic, and geographical characteristics highlights the importance of research into the causes of that variability and strategies to provide equitable access to developmental evaluations and services.\n\n These findings also underscore the need for enhanced infrastructure for diagnostic, treatment, and support services to meet the needs of all children.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8639024","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Centers for Disease Control and

presence of characteristic behavioral impairments that emerge in the second year of life and thus is not typically made until 3 to 4 years of age.\n Recent studies of early brain and behavior development have provided important new insights into the nature of this condition.\n Autism-specific brain imaging features have been identified as early as 6 months of age, and age-specific brain and behavior changes have been demonstrated across the first 2 years of life, highlighting the developmental nature of ASD.\n New findings demonstrate that early brain imaging in the first year of life holds great promise for presymptomatic prediction of ASD.\n There is a general understanding in medicine that earlier treatment has better outcomes than later treatment, and in autism, there is an emerging consensus that earlier intervention results in more successful outcomes for the child.\n Examining early brain and behavior trajectories also has the potential to parse the etiologic heterogeneity in ASD, a well-recognized impediment to developing targeted, mechanistic treatments.\n This review highlights the current state of the science in the pursuit of early brain and

suggests magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the first year of life can predict later diagnostic status in high-risk siblings.\n We investigated whether MRI-based screening is a cost-effective method for assigning early intervention.\n A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was used to evaluate two MRI-based screening strategies at 6 and 12 months of age.\n Primary outcomes were costs in U.\nS.\n dollars and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).\n Results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).\n Costs were estimated from societal, health care, and educational perspectives.\n One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.\n From a societal perspective, the ICER for MRI-based screening at 6 months was $49,000 per QALY when compared to the status quo, implying that such screening is cost-effective at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $50,000–$100,000 per QALY.\n From the health care and educational perspectives, the ICERs were larger at $99,000 and $76,000 per QALY, respectively.\n Sensitivity analysis identified that the parameters most influential in affecting cost-effectiveness were the prevalence of ASD and/or co-occurring intellectual disability.\n MRI specificity also has significant impacts which add to the uncertainty of the results.\n Future work is needed to determine the sensitivity and, in particular, the specificity of MRI with more certainty.\n Notably, the cost of the MRI-based screening had the least

T1-weighted/T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) ratio mapping, which previously has been linked to myelination, represents an interesting candidate measure in this respect, as an accessible measure from standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences.\n Yet, its value as an early infancy measure remains largely unexplored.\n Here, we compared T1w/T2w ratio in 5-month-old infants at familial risk (n?=?27) for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to those without elevated autism risk (n?=?16).\n We found lower T1w/T2w ratio in infants at high risk for ASD within widely distributed regions, spanning both white

developmental timescales.\n Further, higher T1w/T2w ratio within these regions was associated with higher scores on measures of concurrent developmental level.\n These findings suggest that T1w/T2w

unclear.\n Here we used resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) during natural sleep to examine the longitudinal development of functional connectivity in language-related networks from 1.5 to 9 months of age.\n We found that functional connectivity of networks that underlie the integration of sensory and motor representations, which is crucial for language development, is disrupted in infants at high familial risk (HR) for developing ASD as early as 1.5 months of age.\n By 9 months of age, HR infants showed hyperconnectivity between auditory and somatosensory regions whereas low risk (LR) infants displayed greater intrahemispheric connectivity between auditory cortex and higher-order temporal regions as well as the hippocampus.\n Furthermore, while LR infants showed robust changes in functional connectivity during the first year of life with increasing long-range connectivity accompanied by decreasing short-range connectivity over time, HR infants displayed limited developmental changes.\n Our findings demonstrate that early disruptions in the development of language-related network connectivity may provide an early marker for the later emergence of ASD

Additionally, it remains unclear how early these differences emerge in development and whether they remain constant or change over time.\n In this study we examined developmental trajectories in spectral power in infants at high- or low-risk for ASD.\n Spectral power was extracted from resting EEG recorded over frontal regions of the scalp when infants were 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of age.\n We used multilevel modeling to assess change over time between risk groups in the delta, theta, low alpha, high alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands.\n The results indicated that across all bands, spectral power was lower in high-risk infants as compared to low-risk infants at 6-months of age.\n Furthermore high-risk infants showed different trajectories of change in spectral power in the subsequent developmental window indicating that not only are the patterns of change different, but that group differences are dynamic within the first two years of life.\n These findings remained the same after removing data from a subset of participants who displayed ASD related behaviors at 24 or 36 months.\n These differences in the nature of the trajectories of EEG power represent

cortical sensitivity to auditory stimuli in infants at high familial risk for later emerging ASD (HR group, N = 15), and compared this to infants with no family history of ASD (LR group, N = 18).\n The infants (aged between 4 and 7 months) were presented with voice and environmental sounds while asleep in the scanner and their behaviour was also examined in the context of observed parent–infant

strong predictor of later outcomes.\n Younger siblings of children with ASD have increased risk of ASD, but also language delay.\n Identifying neural markers of language outcomes in infant siblings could facilitate earlier intervention and improved outcomes.\n This study aimed to determine whether electroencephalography (EEG) measures from the first 2 years of life can explain heterogeneity in language development in children at low and high risk for ASD, and whether associations between EEG measures and language development are different depending on ASD risk status or later ASD diagnosis.\n In this prospective longitudinal study, EEG measures collected between 3 and 24 months were used in a multivariate linear regression model to estimate participants’ 24-month language development.\n Individual baseline longitudinal EEG measures included (1) the slope of EEG power across 3 to 12 months or 3 to 24 months of life for six canonical frequency bands, (2) the estimated EEG power at 6 months of age for the same frequency bands, and (3) terms representing the interaction between ASD risk status and EEG power measures.\n Modeled 24-month language scores using EEG data

The cause is a new strain in the coronavirus family, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. \nThe European Paediatric Association-Union of National European Paediatric Societies and Associations (EPA-UNEPSA) has established a collaborative working group with key Chinese academic institutions and medical centers with the purpose of facilitating the reciprocal exchange of information and sharing scientific knowledge. The aim of this commentary by the China-EPA-UNEPSA working group is to raise awareness regarding children's psychological needs during epidemics and report early data collected in the COVID-19-affected areas in China during the current outbreak, emphasizing the role of families and caregivers in the timely recognition and management of negative emotions.\nEpidemiology of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 outbreak first erupted in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei Province of China, where several local health facilities reported clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause; they were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market. COVID-19 infection rapidly spread throughout China, involving the provinces of Chongqing, Hunan, Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, and Shaanxi. Over the next 3 months, COVID-19 spread to other regions of the world, reaching &gt;100 000 cases globally in the first week of March 2020, of which approximately 80% were reported in China, 6% in South Korea, 3% in Iran, and 0.2% in the US. In Europe, the first case of COVID-19 was registered in a patient hospitalized in Munich, Germany in early January 2020, following contact with a traveler from China. Later, several other cases were reported in variable numbers in Germany, Spain, Italy, France, and other European countries, together representing roughly 5% of the cases of COVID-19 recorded worldwide. Genetic studies on viral strains isolated from patients affected by Coronavirus infection throughout the world confirmed that they are all phylogenetically related to the original Chinese mutant strain. \nIn contrast to seasonal influenza, COVID-19 seems to cause a milder clinical infection in children than in adults or older people. Early studies have suggested that children are just as likely as older age groups to become infected with the coronavirus but are far less likely to develop severe symptoms. The risk of severe disease and death is highest for seniors and those with severe health conditions, such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer, and diabetes. \nCOVID-19 has been perceived worldwide as a major threat to health and a danger to the global economy, affecting people's lives by influencing their everyday behavior and causing feelings of panic anxiety, depression, and often triggering intense dread.\nIn China, COVID-19 has affected children aged 3 months to 17 years, most of whom had close contact with infected persons or were part of a family cluster of cases. No official data are available on the number of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals positive for COVID-19 in the &lt;18 age group. Infected children might appear asymptomatic or present with fever, dry cough, and fatigue, and few have upper respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion and running nose. Some patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Most infected children have mild clinical manifestations without fever or symptoms of pneumonia, and the majority recover within 1-2 weeks after disease onset. Few progress to lower respiratory infections.\nAlthough children seem to be less vulnerable than adults to COVID-19, initial reports from Chinese areas hit by the outbreak indicate that children and adolescents have been impacted psychologically, manifesting behavioral problems, as discussed below. \nEarly Investigation of Chinese Children's Behavioral and Emotional Reactions to COVID-19\nChildren are not indifferent to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. They experience fears, uncertainties, and physical and social isolation and may miss school for a prolonged period. Understanding their reactions and emotions is essential to properly address their needs. A preliminary study conducted in Shaanxi Province during the second week of February 2020, which was authorized by the local authorities, showed that the most common psychological and behavioral problems among 320 children and adolescents (168 girls and 142 boys) aged 3-18 were clinginess, distraction, irritability, and fear of asking questions about the epidemic (unpublished data). Because of the Chinese government's mobility restrictions related to epidemics, as enforced by local and national authorities, the study was performed using an online questionnaire to investigate the children's behavioral and emotional responses to the current epidemics. Several children were confined at home under protective isolation because they resided in highly affected areas.\nThe questionnaire, which was completed by the parents, incorporated the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria commonly used for a cross-cultural assessment of anxiety disorders, including depression. Fear of asking about the epidemics and the health of relatives, poor sleep including nightmares, poor appetite, physical discomfort, agitation and inattention, clinginess, and separation problems were among the main psychological conditions investigated. An important factor ensuring the reliability of results collected by questionnaires investigating mental disorders in general and particularly during emergencies is the procedure for data collection and statistical analysis followed by specialized personnel responsible for data collection, registration, and statistical processing, as in this case. The use of standard statistical methods ensures the comparability of the results with other studies.   \nThe purpose of the questionnaire used in the Chinese study was not to establish a final diagnosis of mental disorder and depression or to monitor depression severity, but rather to screen for behavioral and emotional disorders as a &quot;first step&quot; approach. Subjects who screened positive at preliminary investigation of their behavioral and emotional condition should be included in future programs to determine whether they meet criteria for a depressive disorder.\nPsychological distress in Children Exposed to Adverse Events\nAlthough the knowledge base regarding children's responses to trauma and adverse events in general has been expanding, descriptions of their responses during epidemics remain scarce. Yet their vulnerability makes this an important group to study. Several studies have documented the damaging effects of psychological stress due to negative events in children. Anxiety, depression, lethargy, impaired social interaction, and reduced appetite are commonly reported manifestations. Physiological effects include a weakened or compromised immune system. In the course of adverse events, children are often forced to stay home for long periods due to enforced isolation and school closure, resulting in limited connection with classmates and reduced physical activity.\nA preliminary study conducted in the Shaanxi province during the COVID-19 epidemic by the China-EPA-UNEPSA collaborative working group showed that children in the younger age group (3-6 years) were more likely than older children to manifest symptoms, such as clinginess and fear that family members could contract the infection (P = .002). Children aged 6 to 18 years were more likely to show inattention (P = .049) and persistent inquiry (P = .003). Clinging, inattention, and irritability were the most severe psychological conditions demonstrated by the children in all age groups (Figure; available at www.jpeds.com). The rates of fear, anxiety, and other emotions were higher in children residing in highly epidemic areas; however, the differences between areas identified by different levels of epidemic risk were not statistically significant. Media entertainment was largely successfully used by families over reading and physical exercise as a means to relieve their children's distress and address their concerns regarding the negative condition they were experiencing (Table; available at www.jpeds.com).\nThe Importance of Nurturing Resilience in Children Exposed to Epidemics\nChildren facing unexpected and unknown events typically exhibit various stress reactions, as confirmed in the study performed in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. Resilience, the personal attributes that help children manage everything from little disappointments to big life traumas, should be nurtured and implemented by public health programs in children and teens living in areas hit by calamities such as epidemics. If properly supported by healthcare professionals, families, and other social connections, including school environment, children and adolescents can appropriately overcome a condition of distress and prospectively stabilize emotionally and physiologically. \nConclusions\nPediatricians working in Shaanxi Province, China have pursued the strategy of nurturing resilience in children and adolescents hit by the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic. The measures suggested by Chinese pediatricians to parents and family members, included increasing communication with children to address their fears and concerns, playing collaborative games to alleviate loneliness, encouraging activities that promote physical activity, and using music therapy in the form of singing to reduce the worry, fear, and stress that the child may feel. All these measures are focused on supporting the child to get through this difficult time. Furthermore, parents should pay attention to sleep difficulties and nightmares, prevent increased daytime sleep and suggest sleep hygiene and relaxation methods, model a positive psychological attitude to reduce stress, and divert attention to more productive and positive directions.\nThe effect of this outbreak is unclear at present, as the situation is rapidly evolving. The China-EPA-UNEPSA working group believes that the preliminary report from the Chinese province of Shaanxi includes useful information for professionals involved in the care of children hit by the current and possible future epidemics. \nReferences\nGenomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding\nCovid-19:Navigating the uncharted\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019\nCOVID-19 situation\nTransmission of 2019-nCoV infection from an asymptomatic contact in Germany\nGenomic epidemiology of novel coronavirus (HCoV-19)\nNature.

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

The epidemiology of emotional disorders is greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence rate and socio-demographic correlates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese students aged 12-18 years during the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to conduct rapid assessment. A total of 8079 participants were involved in the study. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, assess students' awareness of COVID-19, and assess depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, respectively. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 43.7%, 37.4%, and 31.3%, respectively, among Chinese high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender was the higher risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. In terms of grades, senior high school was a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; the higher the grade, the greater the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our findings show there is a high prevalence of psychological health problems among adolescents, which are negatively associated with the level of awareness of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the government needs to pay more attention to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19.\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00787-020-01541-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\nIntroduction\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) first broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on 31 December 2019, and it was later declared an international public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). The novel coronavirus disease has spread to 201 countries/territories outside of China and infected 634,835 patients globally (81,470 in China) as of March 29, 2020. It is worrying that so many people and countries have been affected so quickly. The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused mental health problems among the public and health care workers in China. For instance, it has caused public panic and mental health stress. The increasing number of confirmed cases and the increasing number of outbreak-affected provinces and countries have led to the public's fears that they may be infected. In particular, adolescents are a vulnerable group that is presenting with more and more complex issues.\nMental health is considered to be the most essential condition for a good quality of life. Adolescents with good mental health can bring their happiness and self-confidence into adulthood, thus providing the ability to cope with adversity. Mental health disorders account for 16% of the global burden of disease and injury among people aged 10-19 years. It is estimated that 10-20% of children and adolescents throughout the world are troubled by mental health problems. Globally, depression is the fourth leading cause of disease and disability among adolescents aged 15-19 years, and the 15th for those aged 10-14 years. Meanwhile, anxiety is the ninth leading cause of disease and disability for adolescents aged 15-19 years and sixth for those aged 10-14 years. Studies have reported high detection rates of mental problems in Chinese children and adolescents, ranging from 10.7 to 27.6%. Various emotional or behavioral problems affect at least 30 million Chinese children and adolescents under 17 years of age. Further studies showed that the incidence of behavioral and emotional problems was 17.6% among Chinese school children and adolescents aged 6-16. The mental health problems of adolescents include conduct disorders, emotional disorders, self-harm, eating disorders, and hyperkinetic disorders. Additionally, there is more and more evidence that the prevalence of adolescent emotional disorders is increasing. For example, the 12-month prevalence of major depressive episodes in adolescents increased from 8.7% in 2005 to 11.3% in 2014 in the United States.\nStressful events are potent adverse environmental factors that can predispose individuals to psychiatric disorders, in particular depression. In addition, studies have shown that during an epidemic outbreak, the public experiences negative emotional responses, such as anxiety and depression symptoms. Current studies have shown that COVID-19 causes moderate-to-severe symptoms of anxiety and depression in about one-third of adults for Chinese people. The National Health Commission has released guidelines to promote psychological crisis intervention for patients, people under medical observation, medical workers, and civilians during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, it is not clear what is the occurrence and distribution of depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescents. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly assess depressive and anxiety symptoms related to emergencies for civilians, especially adolescents.\nThe objective of the current study was to assess the prevalence of two specific mental symptoms, anxiety and depression, and their socio-demographic correlates among adolescents in the Chinese population during the COVID-19 outbreak.\nMethods\nDesign and subjects\nWe conducted this cross-sectional study using an online survey to assess mental health problems from March 8 to March 15, 2020. Junior and senior high school students in China aged 12-18 years were invited to participate in the online survey through the Wenjuanxing platform (https://www.wjx.cn/app/survey.aspx). In total, 8140 participants took part in the survey. After removing the data of participants with incomplete questionnaires, 8079 participants from 21 provinces and autonomous regions were included in the analysis. These regions can represent the overall conditions of China. There is no significant difference in the infection rate of COVID-19 in other regions except Hubei. We divided the participants into from Hubei region and from other regions. The province of Hubei has a population of 59,270,000 and includes the city of Wuhan; Hubei province incurred the highest rate of infections and deaths in China.\nApproval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Beijing HuiLongGuan Hospital. All the participants provided online informed consent to participate in the study.\nAssessment tools and procedure\nA data collection sheet was designed to collect basic socio-demographic information and students' awareness of COVID-19 (COVID-19 knowledge, prevention and control measures, projections of COVID-19 trend), and two specific mental symptoms, depressive and anxiety symptoms, were assessed through the online survey. The questions about the awareness of COVID-19 asked participants to select responses from a self-made questionnaire. For the first questions, respondents were asked about their familiarity with information about prevention and control of COVID-19, with responses ranging from 1 (&quot;very unfamiliar&quot;) to 10 (&quot;very familiar&quot;). In the second question, respondents were asked if they had taken all the optional prevention and control measures against COVID-19 to avoid infection, and the response range was from 1 (&quot;very consistent&quot;) to 10 (&quot;very inconsistent&quot;). In the third question, respondents were asked about their attitudes towards the projections of COVID-19 trend, ranging from 1 (&quot;very pessimistic&quot;) to 10 (&quot;very optimistic&quot;).\nDepressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which consists of nine items. The PHQ-9 is a simple, highly effective self-assessment tool for depression. Participants are asked to report the presence of nine problems, including depression and interest decline, in the last 2 weeks on a 4-point scale ranging from &quot;nearly every day&quot; (3 points) to &quot;not at all&quot; (0 points). The scores for symptom severity were 5-9 for mild, 10-14 for moderate, and 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 for severe. The PHQ-9 has a good internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient between 0.80 and 0.90. Reliability and validity in the general population, as well as in patients with mental disorders, have been demonstrated. PHQ-9 has been widely used to assess depressive symptoms in adolescents.\nAnxiety symptoms were assessed by the Chinese version of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), which measures seven symptoms. Participants are asked how often they were bothered by each symptom during the last 2 weeks. The response options are &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;several days,&quot; &quot;more than half the days,&quot; and &quot;nearly every day,&quot; scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The scores for symptom severity were 5-9 for mild, 10-14 for moderate, and 15-21 for severe. Good retesting reliability and validity for GAD-7 have been confirmed in Chinese people. The Cronbach's alpha is between 0.90 and 0.92. The scale has been used in many studies to assess anxiety symptoms in adolescents.\nStatistical analysis\nThe dataset was analyzed using SPSS version 24.0 (IBM SPSS, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). For demographic data, Chi-squared tests were used to analyze categorical variables. The scores for COVID-19 knowledge, prevention and control measures, and projections of the COVID-19 trend fit the normal distribution, so we used an independent-samples t test to compare the difference between the groups with and without depressive symptoms. The same method was used to compare the difference between the groups with and without anxiety symptoms. Logistic regression was used to analyze the predictors of depression and anxiety symptoms. With versus without depressive symptoms and with versus without anxiety symptoms represent dichotomous dependent variables. The level of significance was set at 0.05 (two-sided).\nResults\nSocio-demographic characteristics and association with depressive and anxiety symptoms (N = 8079)\nVariables	n	%	Depressive symptoms	Anxiety symptoms	 				n	%	P	n	%	P	 	Gender					0.001			0.038	 	 Male	3753	46.5	1566	41.7		1358	36.2		 	 Female	4326	53.5	1967	45.5		1662	38.4		 	Region					 &lt; 0.001			 &lt; 0.001	 	 City	3103	38.4	1169	37.7		1009	32.5		 	 Rural area	4976	61.6	2364	47.5		2011	40.4		 	Grade					 &lt; 0.001			 &lt; 0.001	 	 Junior grade one	625	7.8	200	32.0		177	28.3		 	 Junior grade two	2248	27.9	820	36.5		756	33.6		 	 Junior grade three	882	10.9	404	45.8		347	39.3		 	 Senior grade one	2220	27.6	1,000	45.0		801	36.1		 	 Senior grade two	1486	18.4	739	49.7		610	41.0		 	 Senior grade three	596	7.4	357	59.9		317	53.2		 	\nA total of 8140 junior and senior high school students (12-18 years old, median = 16) were invited to participate in the online survey; 8079 fulfilled the study inclusion criteria and completed the assessments, giving a response rate of 99.3%. Table 1 shows the socio-demographic characteristics and their associations with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our results showed differences in depressive and anxiety symptoms among students from different regions. Univariate analysis found that the proportion of depressive symptoms among students in cities was lower than that in rural areas (37.7% versus 47.5%), as was the proportion of anxiety symptoms (32.5% versus 40.4%). The proportion of male students with depressive and anxiety symptoms was lower than that of female students (41.7 versus 45.5%; 36.2% versus 38.4%). Depressive and anxiety symptoms differed between grades. With increasing grade (from junior grade one to three and from senior grade one to three), the proportion of students with depressive and anxiety symptoms increased.\nThe rate of different severities of depressive and anxiety symptoms (N = 8,079)\nVariables	Depressive symptoms	Anxiety symptoms	Comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms	 	n	%	n	%	n	%	 	None	4546	56.3	5059	62.6	5552	68.7	 	Mild	2131	26.4	2184	27.0	-	-	 	Moderate	816	10.1	596	7.4	-	-	 	Moderately severe	367	4.5	-	-	-	-	 	Severe	219	2.7	240	3.0	-	-	 	Mild to severe	3533	43.7	3020	37.4	2527	31.3	 	\nThe trend of depressive and anxiety symptoms during the survey period\nThe proportion of depressive and anxiety symptom items\nTable 2 shows the proportion of students with different levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Mild and moderate depressive and anxiety symptoms were most common. The rate of mild depression was 26.4%, while that of moderate depression was 10.1%; meanwhile, the rate of mild anxiety was 27.0%, and that of moderate anxiety was 7.4%. The proportion of all of the participating students with mild-to-severe depressive symptoms was 43.7%, and the proportion of all of the students with mild-to-severe anxiety symptoms was 37.4%. The prevalence of comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms was 31.3% among all the participants. As shown in Figs. 1a and 2a, the prevalence of depressive symptoms ranged from 39.6% to 64.0% from March 8 to March 15, 2020. Little interest or pleasure in doing things (53.9%), feeling tired or having little energy (48.4%), poor appetite or overeating (45.6%) are common signs. As shown in Figs. 1b and 2b, anxiety symptoms ranged from 34.1 to 50.0% from March 8 to March 15, 2020. Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge (53.6%), worrying too much about different things (47.3%), becoming easily annoyed or irritable (47.0%) are the most common symptoms.\nThe relationship between COVID-19 cognition and depressive and anxiety symptoms (N = 8079)\nVariables	With depressive symptoms M (SD)	Without depressive symptoms M (SD)	P	With anxiety symptoms M (SD)	Without anxiety symptoms M (SD)	P	 	COVID-19 Knowledge	6.35 (2.21)	7.20 (2.24)	&lt; 0.001	6.41 (2.24)	7.08 (2.25)	&lt; 0.001	 	Prevention and control measures	7.67 (2.30)	8.59 (2.02)	&lt; 0.001	7.70 (2.29)	8.48 (2.08)	&lt; 0.001	 	Projections of COVID-19 trend	6.98 (2.61)	8.08 (2.39)	&lt; 0.001	6.78 (2.67)	8.09 (2.34)	&lt; 0.001	 	\nTable 3 presents the relationship between COVID-19 cognition and depressive and anxiety symptoms.

In the multivariable model, female gender was the higher risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms (ORDE = 1.15, 95% CI 1.05-1.26; ORAN = 1.10, 95% CI 1.001-1.21). With regard to provinces, we found that Hubei province was a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms (ORDE = 1.58, 95% CI 1.34-1.87; ORAN = 1.64, 95% CI 1.39-1.93). In terms of grades, senior high school was a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; the higher the grade, the greater the risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, for junior high school, we only found junior grade three to be a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms (ORDE = 1.40, 95% CI 1.11-1.75; ORAN = 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.67). We also found that awareness of COVID-19 (COVID-19 knowledge, prevention and control measures, and projections of COVID-19 trend) were protective factors against depressive and anxiety symptoms.\nDiscussion\nIn this large-scale, cross-sectional epidemiological study, the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in middle and high school students of China was 43.7% and 37.4%, respectively. In addition, the prevalence of comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms among the students was 31.3%. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was higher than the figures found in Sweden (8.8%) and Japan (14.9%) in the absence of epidemics. In China, adolescents had a higher incidence of depressive symptoms during COVID-19 than adults. The prevalence of depressive symptoms is significantly influenced by sociocultural and economic contexts; therefore, it needs to be assessed in different countries and regions. According to a pre-COVID-19 meta-analysis, the general prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese children and adolescents was 15.4%. The reported prevalence of anxiety disorder varied widely in previous studies. The lowest rate reported was 2.6% in American 11-year-olds, and the highest was 41.2% in Japanese 7-9-year-olds. One study found that the prevalence of anxiety disorders among Chinese children and adolescents was 6.06%. Studies have shown that the incidence of anxiety symptoms among Chinese high school students ranges from 13.7 to 24.5%. Our current results were similar to those of the public perception of anxiety at the peak phase during H1N1. Clearly, the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescents was higher than in the general population in China in the early and peak periods of COVID-19. Thus, although the infection rate of COVID-19 in China is leveling off (the infection rate of COVID-19 was 11.4 x 10-4 in Hubei province and 0.03 x 10-4-0.2 x 10-4 in other provinces) during our survey, the rate of depressive and anxiety symptoms among adolescents was still high. This is a warning that we should not ignore the psychological health problems of young people just because the epidemic has eased. In the follow-up work, we should also pay attention to the changes of depressive and anxiety symptoms in these children.\nBoth genetic factors and external environmental factors (stressful life events in particular) are considered to be involved in the onset of depression. In the face of stressful events, everyone will develop anxiety and depressive symptoms. As a sensitive group, adolescents are particularly worthy of attention.\nIn pace with the wide spread of COVID-19 outside China, our findings provide important guidance for the development of psychological support strategies in China and other affected areas. At present, the epidemic has been well controlled in China, but it is still spreading outside China. Thus, health care systems and the public must be well prepared for medical treatment and psychological issues. Our findings have clinical and policy implications. First, health authorities need to identify high-risk groups according to social population information to carry out early psychological intervention. Our socio-demographic data show that female students have suffered from greater psychological impact, as well as higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, during the COVID-19 outbreak. This finding is consistent with previous epidemiological studies that found that women were at a higher risk of depression. A similar study among students found that female students were more likely to be anxious. Furthermore, we found that the proportion of anxiety and depressive symptoms among students living in rural areas is significantly higher than that in urban areas, which is closely related to their poor economic situation. This is also consistent with previous studies, with some studies finding that the rate of emotional disorder is nearly twice as high among the poor as among the wealthy. Additionally, senior grade three students had higher levels of anxiety and depression than senior grade one students and the highest rate among all the students. As senior grade three students face the most important test of their lives (the college entrance examination), the COVID-19 outbreak disrupts their normal pace of learning, leading to increased pressure; it can be inferred that the academic pressure causes more pressure on students. Junior three students facing high school entrance examinations have the same problem. In China, students in junior three must have good grades to get into a good high school, they also had more anxiety and depressive symptoms.\nMoreover, our findings suggest that the level of knowledge and the prevention and control measures for COVID-19 may have protective psychological effects in the early stages of the epidemic. It can be seen that strengthening the publicity of COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary measures adopted to prevent the spread of COVID-19 can reduce the anxiety and depression levels of the public. This is consistent with previous studies finding that wearing a mask and practicing hand hygiene reduces the level of anxiety and depression during the epidemic. However, press/media coverage can also adversely affect anxiety and depressive symptoms, false information and false reports about COVID-19 can aggravate anxiety and depressive symptoms in the general public. The latest and most accurate information, such as the number of people who have recovered, and the progress of medicines and vaccines, can reduce anxiety levels. Therefore, the government and health authorities should provide accurate information on the epidemic situation, refute rumors in time, and reduce the impact of rumors on the public emotional state. Strengthening prevention and control measures can not only block the spread of disease but also provide a sense of security, thus bringing potential psychological benefits. Therefore, governments and health authorities should ensure that infrastructure is in place to produce and provide adequate quantities of masks, hand sanitizer, and other personal hygiene products during the COVID-19 epidemic. Positive and optimistic attitude towards the development of COVID-19 epidemic was also a protective factor against depressive and anxiety symptoms. The epidemiology of infection rates and deaths likely affects depressive and anxiety symptoms. During the H1N1 pandemic, public anxiety was at its worst at the height of the epidemic, and has declined as the epidemic has eased.\nDue to the outbreak of COVID-19, major cities in China have shut down schools at all levels indefinitely. Although education authorities have developed online portals and web-based applications to provide lectures or other teaching activities, the uncertainty and potential negative effects on academic development will have adverse effects on students' psychological health. Besides, students are also required to report daily health conditions, limit their travel, thus entailing that they are isolated at home, which can lead to anxiety and depression. Because students are currently taking online classes at home, and are receptive to smartphone apps, health authorities can consider providing online or smartphone-based psychological interventions. Online platforms can also provide online psychological support for students who stay at home most of the time during the epidemic and can reduce the risk of virus transmission due to face-to-face contact. In addition, when conducting online teaching, teachers should also pay attention to the assessment of students' anxiety and depressive symptoms, communicating with their parents in a timely manner so as to implement effective intervention.\nThis study has two limitations. One possible bias could have led to underestimating the prevalence of anxiety and depression. This sample was a non-probability sample, which is a sample of voluntary participants. For some areas with a severe epidemic situation, anxiety and depression rates may be higher. However, due to the influence of anxiety and depression, students may not be willing to participate in the questionnaire survey, and there may be a certain deviation in the response population. Furthermore, due to the online questionnaire being a self-report evaluation, the indicated levels of anxiety and depression may not always be consistent with the evaluation of mental health professionals.\nIn conclusion, our results show there is a high prevalence of psychological health problems among adolescents, which is negatively associated with the level of knowledge about and the prevention and control measures for COVID-19. These findings suggest that the government needs pay more attention to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19. Fortunately, the Chinese government has provided psychological health services through various channels, including hotlines, online consultation, and outpatient consultation, but more attention should be paid to depression and anxiety, especially among adolescents.\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nShuang-Jiang Zhou and Li-Gang Zhang contributed equally to this work.

aimed to compare the strength of associations between different cognitive and affective measures of risk and self-reported protective behaviors in a series of ten cross-sectional surveys conducted throughout the first wave of influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.\n\n\nMethods\nAll surveys were conducted using questionnaire-based telephone interviews, with random digit dialing to recruit adults from the general population.\n\n Measures of anxiety and worry (affective) and perceived risk (cognitive) regarding A/H1N1 were made in 10 serial surveys.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the cognitive/affective-behavioral associations in each survey while multilevel logistic models were conducted to estimate the average effects of each cognitive/affective measure on adoption of protective behaviors throughout the ten surveys.\n\n\nResults\nExcepting state anxiety, other affective measures including “anticipated worry”, “experienced worry” and “current worry” specific to A/H1N1 risk were consistently and strongly associated with adoption of protective behaviors across different survey periods.\n\n However, the cognitive-behavioral associations were weaker and inconsistent across the ten surveys.\n\n Perceived A/H1N1 severity relative to SARS had stronger associations with adoption of protective behaviors in the late epidemic periods than in the early epidemic periods.\n\n\nConclusion\nRisk-specific worries appear to be significantly associated with the adoption of protective behaviors at different epidemic stages, whereas cognitive measures may become more important in understanding people’s behavioral responses later in epidemics.\n\n Future epidemic-related psycho-behavioral research should include more affective-loaded measures of risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3986671","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

heterogeneous, for instance, in terms of conceptualizing risk perception as an exclusively cognitive or as a cognitive and emotional phenomenon or whether the concept was dominated by expectancy or expectancy and value components.\n\n Similarly, the majority of studies investigating risk perceptions and protective behaviors were not model-based.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe current body of knowledge can only provide preliminary insights.\n\n Unlike the reviewed studies, which were mostly launched as a rapid response to outbreak situations, future research will have to invest more strongly into theoretical work to provide sounder evidence.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7090865","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer

influenza in Australia: Using telephone surveys to measure perceptions of threat and willingness to comply","abstract":"Background\nBaseline data is necessary for monitoring how a population perceives the threat of pandemic influenza, and perceives how it would behave in the event of pandemic influenza.\n\n Our aim was to develop a module of questions for use in telephone health surveys on perceptions of threat of pandemic influenza, and on preparedness to comply with specific public health behaviours in the event of pandemic influenza.\n\n\nMethods\nA module of questions was developed and field tested on 192 adults using the New South Wales Department of Health's in-house Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) facility.\n\n The questions were then modified and re field tested on 202 adults.\n\n The module was then incorporated into the New South Wales Population Health Survey in the first quarter of 2007. A representative sample of 2,081 adults completed the module.\n\n Their responses were weighted against the state population.\n\n\nResults\nThe reliability of the questions was acceptable with kappa ranging between 0.25 and 0.51. Overall 14.9% of the state population thought pandemic influenza was very or extremely likely to occur; 45.5% were very or extremely concerned that they or their family would be affected by pandemic influenza if it occurred; and 23.8% had made some level of change to the way they live their life because of the possibility of pandemic influenza.\n\n In the event of pandemic influenza, the majority of the population were willing to: be vaccinated (75.4%), be isolated (70.2%), and wear a face mask (59.9%).\n\n People with higher levels of threat perception are significantly more likely to be willing to comply with specific public health behaviours.\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile only 14.9% of the state population thought pandemic influenza was very or extremely likely to occur, a significantly higher proportion were concerned for self and family should a pandemic actually occur.\n\n The baseline data collected in this survey will be useful for monitoring changes over time in the population's perceptions of threat, and preparedness to comply with specific public health behaviours.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2556339","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

2009 were tested against theory and data-derived hypothesized associations between trust in (formal/informal) information, understanding, self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility and worry, and hand hygiene and social distancing using Structural Equation Modelling with multigroup comparisons.\n\n\nPrincipal Findings\nTrust in formal (government/media) information about influenza was associated with greater reported understanding of A/H1N1 cause (??=?0.36) and A/H1N1 prevention self-efficacy (??=?0.25), which in turn were associated with more hand hygiene (??=?0.19 and ??=?0.23, respectively).\n\n Trust in informal (interpersonal) information was negatively associated with perceived personal A/H1N1 susceptibility (??=??0.21), which was negatively associated with perceived self-efficacy (??=??0.42) but positively associated with influenza worry (??=?0.44).\n\n Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry (??=?0.16) which was in turn associated with greater social distancing (??=?0.36).\n\n Multigroup comparisons showed gender differences regarding paths from trust in formal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, trust in informal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, and understanding of A/H1N1 cause to perceived self-efficacy.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nTrust in government/media information was more strongly associated with greater self-efficacy and handwashing, whereas trust in informal information was strongly associated with perceived health threat and avoidance behaviour.\n\n Risk

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\ng.\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\ng.\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n","id":"PMC7084952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Cuiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Riyu","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyang","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yilin","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Linkang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cyrus S.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Roger C.","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern","abstract":"","id":"PMC7135038","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"cyh-birm@263.net","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter W","surname":"Horby","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick G","surname":"Hayden","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1007.030703","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS Control and Psychological Effects of Quarantine, Toronto, Canada","abstract":"Explores effects of quarantine on those quarantined for SARS, Toronto, Canada","id":"PMC3323345","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Hawryluck","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wayne L.","surname":"Gold","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Robinson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Pogorski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sandro","surname":"Galea","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rima","surname":"Styra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/jcm9020330","date":"2020-01-23","title":"The Extent of Transmission of Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, 2020","abstract":"A cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported by China in late December 2019.

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth.\n The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation.\n We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0.\n Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.\n The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403–540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18–25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.\n We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49–2.63).\n Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.\n","id":"PMC7074332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Shi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinjun","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guangpu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daozhou","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nWhen an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered.\n\n Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities.\n\n The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities.\n At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down.\n It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities.\n Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma.\n The severity of this epidemic and its long-lasting repercussions

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing

fully structured interview.\n\n Sensitivity and specificity were examined among participant subgroups and, separately, using meta-regression, considering all subgroup variables in a single model.\n\n\nResults\nData were obtained for 58 of 72 eligible studies (total n=17?357; major depression cases n=2312).\n\n Combined sensitivity and specificity was maximized at a cut-off score of 10 or above among studies using a semistructured interview (29 studies, 6725 participants; sensitivity 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.92; specificity 0.85, 0.82 to 0.88).\n\n Across cut-off scores 5-15, sensitivity with semistructured interviews was 5-22% higher than for fully structured interviews (MINI excluded; 14 studies, 7680 participants) and 2-15% higher than for the MINI (15 studies, 2952 participants).\n\n Specificity was similar across diagnostic interviews.\n\n The PHQ-9 seems to be similarly sensitive but may be less specific for younger patients than for older patients; a cut-off score of 10 or above can be used regardless of age.\n\n.\n\n\nConclusions\nPHQ-9 sensitivity compared with semistructured diagnostic interviews was greater than in previous conventional meta-analyses that combined reference standards.\n\n A cut-off score of 10 or above maximized combined sensitivity and specificity overall and for subgroups.\n\n\nRegistration\nPROSPERO

body and behaviour that may affect mental health.\n\n We found that no study measures the depression and anxiety in adolescence in our region, so we want to measure it and then try to improve our community.\n\n\nAim:\nWe aim to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among high school students at Qassim region.\n\n\nMethods:\nA cross-sectional study done in al-Qassim region.\n\n A targeted population was secondary school students.\n\n The sample size was 1245 students.\n\n We used the questionnaire tool the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression in the students and the GAD7 for anxiety.\n\n The data had been gathered through MS Excel then exported to the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) for analyses.\n\n A P value cut-off point of 0.05 at 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to determine statistical significance.\n\n The analyses measure the association between socio-demographic and other related variables in the survey by using a Chi-square test.\n\n\nResult:\nOur study shows that depression by using (PHQ-9) among the 1245 students, 325 (26.0%) were not depressed, 423 (34%) were mildly depressed, 306 (24.6%) were moderately depressed, whereas 129 (10.4%) were moderately severe depressed and 62 (5.0%) were severely depressed.\n\n Anxiety by using the GAD-7 questionnaire, it was revealed that out of 1245 students, 455 (36.5%) of them were without anxiety, 425 (34.1%) of them were having mild anxiety, 243 (19.5%) of them were having moderate anxiety and 122 (9.8%) were having severe anxiety.\n\n Depression and anxiety, according to gender (P value &lt;0.001), show a significant relationship.\n\n\nConclusion:\nWe have to raise the awareness of the mental health in our community as the prevalence of mental disorder has significantly increased over time.\n\n Health services should make health education for students on how they deal with stress and depression through exercise and good sleep.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6436297","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Medknow Publications &amp; Media Pvt

A novel coronavirus was eventually identified, and became the COVID-19 epidemic that affected public health and life. We investigated the psychological status and behavior changes of the general public in China from January 30 to February 3, 2020.\nMethods\nRespondents were recruited via social media (WeChat) and completed an online questionnaire. We used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Self-rating Depression Scale, and Symptom Checklist-90 to evaluate psychological status. We also investigated respondents' behavior changes. Quantitative data were analyzed by t-tests or analysis of variance, and classified data were analyzed with chi-square tests.\nResults\nIn total, 608 valid questionnaires were obtained. More respondents had state anxiety than trait anxiety (15.8% vs 4.0%). Depression was found among 27.1% of respondents and 7.7% had psychological abnormalities. About 10.1% of respondents suffered from phobia. Our analysis of the relationship between subgroup characteristics and psychological status showed that age, gender, knowledge about COVID-19, degree of worry about epidemiological infection, and confidence about overcoming the outbreak significantly influenced psychological status. Around 93.3% of respondents avoided going to public places and almost all respondents reduced Spring Festival-related activities.

The three most commonly used prevention measures were making fewer trips outside and avoiding contact (98.0%), wearing a mask (83.7%), and hand hygiene (82.4%).\nConclusions\nWe need to pay more attention to public psychological stress, especially among young people, as they are likely to experience anxiety, depression, and psychological abnormalities. Different psychological interventions could be formulated according to the psychological characteristics of different gender and age groups. The majority of respondents followed specific behaviors required by the authorities, but it will take time to observe the effects of these behaviors on the epidemic.\nBackground\nAcute respiratory infectious diseases have emerged continuously over the past 20 years. In 2003, a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic broke out in Guangdong Province, China, which had a lasting impact on public health in China and worldwide. Since then, new epidemic outbreaks have continued to emerge, such as the H5N1 avian influenza A in 2004, the H1N1 influenza A in 2009, the Ebola virus in 2014, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012. In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases without certain etiology occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. The clinical manifestations were similar to viral pneumonia; a new coronavirus was subsequently identified. This disease was later named &quot;coronavirus disease 2019&quot; (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of February 8, 2020, 37 539 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported worldwide, of which 37 251 were in China; there were 812 deaths. The epidemic situation in China was serious.\nOn January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 epidemic constituted a public health emergency of international concern. At the same time, almost all provinces or regions in China had initiated Level I responses to public health emergencies. The Chinese central and local government rapidly implemented rigorous measures to control the development of the epidemic, including extending the Spring Festival holiday, canceling large-scale performances, and encouraging the wearing of masks in public places. As the largest epidemic area, the entire city of Wuhan was &quot;on lockdown&quot;.\nIndividual and collective behavior is particularly important during a pandemic. In the absence of appropriate pharmacological interventions, the main method of controlling outbreaks is to change public behavior. An individual's behavior can affect their family, social networks, organizations in which they participate, communities to which they belong, information they obtain, and the impact on their society. When people learn about disease information, they usually have an emotional response that affects any immediate behavioral changes. A previous study used mathematical models to show that epidemics can affect individuals' fears, and that individuals' emotions may in turn affect behaviors during epidemics. Previous experience suggests that the public is likely to experience anxiety, depression, and panic attacks when faced with highly contagious diseases. A study focused on the avian influenza in France (n = 600) reported that 39.0% of participants expressed anxiety about the disease, and 20.0% that had knowledge about avian influenza had changed their behaviors during the epidemic. During the SARS epidemic, a study from Toronto found a high incidence of psychological distress among 129 quarantined individuals. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression were found in 28.9 and 31.2% of respondents, respectively. During the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, 53.8% of Chinese respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe, 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\nSimilar to individual behavior, individual emotions can easily affect collective emotions. Information about the disease, the psychology of the population, and individuals' behavior interact to influence the spread of an epidemic. Interventions based on these interacting factors can be used to control an epidemic and improve public health. An effective planning and response strategy must consider these complex interactions. However, available studies on COVID-19 have focused on understanding the disease, epidemiology, treatment, and vaccines. However, this outbreak highlighted the fragility of psychological resilience, and we also need to pay attention to the psychological status of ordinary people during an epidemic. At the time of this study, the epidemic curve suggested China was approaching the peak of the epidemic. At this critical point, we investigated the psychological status and behavior changes among ordinary Chinese people during the COVID-19 epidemic, and evaluated whether these factors were related to the spread of the disease.\nMethods\nSetting and participants\nBecause of the outbreak, the Chinese government advised the public to reduce face-to-face interactions and isolate themselves at home. Therefore, we chose to conduct this study through an electronic network survey. We designed a cross-sectional study to investigate the psychological status of the general public in China during the COVID-19 epidemic using an anonymous online questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed via an online survey platform (Wenjuanxing, www.wjx.cn), and the questionnaire link was sent to respondents through social media (WeChat, Tencent, Shenzhen, China). The survey was conducted from January 30 to February 3, 2020. Respondents were selected by snowball sampling. The questionnaire link was first sent to the family members of hospital employees (non-medical workers); these respondents were then encouraged to forward the link to other family members, friends, and colleagues.\nQuestionnaire content\nThe first part of the questionnaire (see supplementary material) covered general demographic information, including gender, age, and region. The second part included questions developed by the present researchers, such as respondents' epidemiological history, their understanding of COVID-19, and the impact of the epidemic outbreak. The third part of the questionnaire comprised the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, score range 20-80) designed by Spielberger and the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) developed by Zung, which were used to evaluate respondents' anxiety and depression, respectively. The final part included the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) designed by Derogatis, which is used to screen for psychological problems other than anxiety and depression.\nQuality control method\nWe set strict parameters that each social media account was only allowed to answer the questionnaire once, and use of the same Internet protocol address to answer another questionnaire was forbidden to ensure the authenticity of responses. The STAI, SDS, and SCL-90 have all been previously validated and used in Chinese populations. Therefore, they were appropriate for use in this study.\nData analysis\nThe collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, New York, United States). Quantitative data were analyzed by t-tests or analysis of variance, and classified data were analyzed by chi-square tests. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nRespondents' demographic characteristics and scale scores\nCOVID-19 epidemic curve and dates of key events in China. On January 24, the Chinese Spring Festival began. The public health emergency I response was initiated in most areas of China on January 25, and the government began to intervene in people's lives and travel on a large scale in an attempt to prevent the epidemic from spreading further. However, the number of confirmed cases continued to rise, and it was not until February 6 that the number of new cases began to decline. The above data were sourced from China CDC and media or official reports\nThe demographic characteristics of the respondents\nVariable	Number (Total, n = 608)	Proportion (%)	 	Gender	Male	251	41.3	 	Female	357	58.7	 	Age group (years)	Below 18 (including 18)	34	5.6	 	19-39	321	52.8	 	40-49	149	24.5	 	50-69	99	16.3	 	Above 70 (including 70)	5	0.8	 	Occupation	Government, enterprises and institutions	136	22.4	 	Worker	123	20.2	 	Student	118	19.4	 	Businessman	58	9.5	 	Medical staff	58	9.5	 	Unemployed	27	4.4	 	Other	88	14.5	 	Education level	Primary school degree	5	0.8	 	Junior high school degree	54	8.9	 	High school degree	80	13.2	 	College degree	389	64.0	 	Master or doctor degree	80	13.2	 	City or region	Hubei province	61	10.0	 	Guangdong province	264	43.4	 		Other province or regions	283	46.5	 	History of epidemiological exposurea	Yes	59	9.7	 	No	549	90.3	 	Someone around you diagnosed as (suspected) epidemiological carrier	Yes	19	3.1	 	No	589	96.9	 	Someone around you who is a medical staff withstanding SARIb	Yes	281	46.2	 	No	227	53.8	 	\na History of epidemiological exposure means he/she has ever been to any epidemic area in Hubei, or been exposed to people there\nbSARI severe acute respiratory infection\nThe survey period was from January 30, 2020 to February 3, 2020. Figure 1 shows the COVID-19 epidemic curve in China and dates of key events. In total, 620 questionnaires were retrieved; 12 questionnaires were excluded because of a previously diagnosed psychological illness. Among the 608 valid questionnaires included in our study, 153 respondents did not complete the SCL-90, and only 455 respondents completed all survey scales. Respondents' demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1. Respondents were from 28 provinces and cities around China and were distributed across different ages, occupations, and education levels; therefore, we believe that these respondents could represent the Chinese public. We found that during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic, respondents' state anxiety scores, trait anxiety scores, SDS index scores, and SCL-90 total scores did not exceed the normal range according to the healthy norm results for these scales (Supplementary Table 1). The analysis of variance by age group, gender, and scale scores showed there were significant differences in STAI scores across age groups (Supplementary Tables 2.1 and 2.2), which was consistent with the STAI normal model. The SDS index scores also varied across age groups. However, the SCL-90 scores did not show any differences by age group or gender. \nPublic psychological status\nThe proportion of respondents with anxiety, depression and psychological abnormalities\nVariable	n	Proportion (%)	 	State anxiety (n = 569)a	Yes	90	15.8	 	No	479	84.2	 	Trait anxiety (n = 569)a	Yes	23	4.0	 	No	546	96.0	 	Depression (n = 608)	Yes	165	27.1	 	No	443	72.9	 	Psychology abnormal (n = 455)b	Yes	35	7.7	 	No	420	92.3	 	\na The age range of ST-AI norm result was from 19 to 69, 39 questionnaires under 18 or above 70 years of age were excluded, 569 cases were enrolled in the analysis\nb Among 608 valid questionnaires, 153 didn't complete SCL-90\nThe healthy norm results of the three scales were used as the criteria to assess psychological status. The age range of STAI norm results was 19-69 years; therefore, we excluded 39 questionnaires for respondents aged &lt; 18 or &gt; 70 years. According to the healthy norm results of the SDS and SCL-90, depression was classified by an SDS index score &gt;= 50, and the psychological abnormality was classified by a SCL-90 total score &gt;= 160. Respondents' psychological status (state anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and psychological abnormalities) is shown in Table 2. \nProportion of respondents by psychological status\nThe chi-square result between State-anxiety and Trait-anxiety\nVariable	Trait anxiety, n (%)	Total	chi2	P value	 	Yes	No	n (%)			 	State anxiety	Yes	21 (91.3)	69 (12.6)	90 (15.8)	96.752	&lt; 0.001	 	No	2 (8.7)	477 (87.4)	479 (84.2)	 	Total	23	546	569	 	\nMore respondents had state anxiety (15.8%, 90/569) than trait anxiety (4.0%, 23/569) (P &lt; 0.001; Table 3). The average score for state anxiety was also higher than that for trait anxiety (Supplementary Table 3), which remained consistent. We also found a high proportion of respondents with depression (27.1%), and 7.7% respondents had psychological abnormalities. \nAnxiety by age groups\nBoth state and trait anxiety were more common in females than in males. Respondents' psychological status also differed across age groups. Respondents aged 19-39 years appeared to be more prone to state anxiety (43.3%), depression (61.8%), and psychological abnormalities (74.3%) than other respondents. Those aged 40-49 years had the lowest rates of state anxiety (15.6%) and trait anxiety (4.4%). The proportion of trait anxiety among respondents aged 50-69 years was 73.9%.\nInfluence of other factors on psychological status\nPsychological status of the public under the epidemic of COVID-19 in

proportions of respondents with trait anxiety and depression differed by their occupation. Differences in education level and region were only found in trait anxiety. People with a history of epidemiology (including those who had visited Hubei province or come into contact with people from epidemic areas) were less likely to be anxious than those who had not. Neither the presence of a confirmed/suspected epidemiological carrier nor the presence of a medical worker around respondents increased levels of anxiety or psychological abnormalities. Moreover, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on respondents' work or life had no effect on their psychological status. However, those who were more worried about being infected with COVID-19 had a higher proportion of state anxiety. Of the respondents with state anxiety, 33.3% were &quot;very worried&quot; about being infected with COVID-19 and only 2.2% were &quot;not worried at all.&quot; Those that were more confident about overcoming the epidemic outbreak appeared to have lower rates of state anxiety and depression compared with other respondents (Table 4). \nBehavior changes\nChi-square analysis results between behavior changes and different psychological status under the epidemic of COVID-19 in China\nVariable		State anxiety, n (%)d	Trait anxiety, n (%)d		Depression, n (%)		Psychology abnormal, n (%)e		 	Total (n = 569)	No (n = 479)	Yes (n = 90)	P value	Total (n = 569)	No (n = 546)	Yes (n = 23)	P value	Total (n = 608)	No (n = 443)	Yes (n = 165)	P value	Total (n = 455)	No (n = 420)	Yes (n = 35)	P value	 	Behavior change 1a	Never	531 (93.3)	444 (92.7)	87 (96.7)	0.166	531 (93.3)	510 (93.4)	21 (91.3)	0.975	567 (93.3)	415 (93.7)	152 (92.1)	0.496	430 (94.5)	398 (94.8)	32 (91.4)	0.656	 	Sometimes	38 (6.7)	35 (7.3)	3 (3.3)	38 (6.7)	36 (6.6)	2 (8.7)	41 (6.7)	28 (6.3)	13 (7.9)	25(5.5)	22 (5.2)	3 (8.6)	 	Same as usual	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	 	More than usual	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	 	Behavior change 2b	Never	510 (89.6)	430 (89.8)	80 (88.9)	0.868	510 (89.6)	488 (89.4)	22 (95.7)	0.624	546 (89.8)	402 (90.7)	144 (87.3)	0.223	416 (91.4)	389 (92.6)	27 (77.1)	0.005	 	Sometimes when necessary	58 (10.2)	48 (10.0)	10 (11.1)	58 (10.2)	57 (10.4)	1 (4.4)	60 (9.9)	40 (9.0)	20 (12.1)	38 (8.4)	30 (7.1)	8 (22.9)	 	Same as Usual	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	1 (0.2)	1 (0.2)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	0 (0.0)	 	More than usual	1 (0.2)	1 (0.2)	0 (0.0)	1 (0.2)	1 (0.2)	0 (0.0)	1 (0.2)	0 (0.0)	1 (0.6)	1 (0.2)	1 (0.2)	0 (0.0)	 	Preventive measures c	1	85 (14.9)	71 (14.8)	14 (15.6)	0.78	85 (14.9)	80 (14.7)	5 (21.7)	0.787	88 (14.5)	50 (11.3)	38 (23.0)	0.004	59 (13.0)	51 (12.1)	8 (22.9)	0.02	 	2	31 (5.5)	24 (5.0)	7 (7.8)	31 (5.5)	30 (5.5)	1 (4.4)	38 (6.3)	26 (5.9)	12 (7.3)	24 (5.3)	19 (4.5)	5 (14.3)	 	3	403 (70.8)	340 (71.0)	63 (70.0)	403 (70.8)	389 (71.3)	14 (60.9)	431 (70.9)	330 (74.5)	101 (61.2)	333 (73.2)	315 (75.0)	18 (51.4)	 	4	49 (8.6)	43 (9.0)	6 (6.7)	49 (8.6)	46 (8.4)	3 (13.0)	50 (8.2)	36 (8.1)	14 (8.5)	38 (8.4)	34 (8.1)	4 (11.4)	 	5	1 (0.2)	1 (0.2)	0 (0.0)	1 (0.2)	1 (0.2)	0 (0.0)	1 (0.2)	1 (0.2)	0 (0.0)	1 (0.2)	1 (0.2)	0 (0.0)	 	\na Behavior change 1: go out to public place\nb Behavior change 2: attend Spring Festival-relative activities\nc Preventive measures: making fewer trips outside and avoiding contact, hand hygiene, wearing a mask, taking traditional Chinese medicine and others\nd The age ranges of ST-AI norm results4 only includes 19-69, so we exclude 39 whose age under 18 and above 70\ne Among 608 valid questionnaires, 53 didn't complete SCL-90\nDuring the COVID-19 epidemic, most (93.3%) respondents avoided going to public places (behavior change 1) (Table 5). Even during the Spring Festival, which is the most important traditional festival in China, almost all respondents reduced festival-related activities (behavior change 2) to avoid contact with others. In addition, at least 70.9% of respondents chose to take three or more preventive measures to avoid infection. The three most commonly used prevention measures were &quot;making fewer trips outside and avoiding contact (98.0%),&quot; &quot;wearing a mask (83.7%),&quot; and &quot;hand hygiene (82.4%)&quot; (Supplement Figure 1). Surprisingly, respondents' anxiety did not appear to be related to public behavior change and preventive measures. Fewer respondents with depression took preventive measures compared with those without depression. In addition, those with psychological abnormalities appeared to be less likely to avoid spring festival-related activities and preventive measures compared with other respondents. \nOther psychological abnormalities: phobia\nThe results of 455 respondents' SCL-90 factors scores compared with norm result of Chinese healthy (mean +- std. deviation)\nVariable	Chinese healthy	Respondents in this study	 	Somatization factor	1.37 +- 0.48	1.18 +- 0.35	 	Obsession factor	1.62 +- 0.58	1.35 +- 0.47	 	Interpersonal sensitivity factor	1.65 +- 0.51	1.27 +- 0.45	 	Depression factor	1.50 +- 0.59	1.24 +- 0.45	 	Anxiety factor	1.39 +- 0.43	1.21 +- 0.40	 	Hostile factor	1.48 +- 0.56	1.19 +- 0.40	 	Phobia factor	1.23 +- 0.41	1.29 +- 0.47	 	Paranoid factor	1.43 +- 0.57	1.18 +- 0.39	 	Psychotic factor	1.29 +- 0.42	1.18 +- 0.39	 	\nThe SCL-90 covers 10 different psychological abnormality factors. According to the results for the normal model of the scale, we defined a score of &gt;= 2 for each factor as corresponding to abnormal symptoms. The results are shown in Table 6. The scores for the phobia factor were the highest, with an average score of 1.29 +- 0.47, which also exceeded Chinese healthy norm results (1.23 +- 0.41). About 10.1% of respondents suffered from phobia (Supplementary Table 4), which indicated that a phobia state may be present in the wider public. \nDiscussion\nMost previous studies in this area focused on the psychological status of patients or medical staff during the epidemic, and little attention has been directed to the psychological status and behavior changes of the general public. Our survey found that the ratio of overall state anxiety among respondents was 15.8%, which was greater than that of trait anxiety, suggesting that the epidemic had caused some anxiety. Previous studies reported the public experienced varying levels of anxiety during previous pandemics. In our study, women appeared to be more prone to anxiety than men, which may be related to their sensitivity to psychological stress. We found the psychological status of different age groups showed different tendencies during the epidemic. It appeared that young people were more likely to suffer from state anxiety, depression, and psychological abnormalities when faced with the epidemic. The reasons for this are complex. This segment of the population tends to obtain more information about such issues from the media. They also have the main responsibility for social productivity and their family, and therefore bear more psychological pressure. Previous studies found that young people had higher anxiety, depression, and stress scores than older people. We also found that older adults had a higher proportion of trait anxiety than other age groups, accounting for 73.9% of the total trait anxiety population. Specific reasons for this result need further research. However, the government needs to make different decisions based on the gender and age characteristics of the population when formulating psychological interventions. There were no significant differences in state anxiety, depression, or psychological abnormalities among people with different education levels, possibly because the public had uniform susceptibility to the epidemic. Higher literacy does not appear to help an individual deal with psychological stress better than lower literacy. The proportion of population with anxiety, depression, and psychological abnormalities in Hubei, the worst-hit province, did not significantly differ from Guangdong or other provinces. This may be explained by the small number of respondents from Hubei province. Because of the outbreak, we were unable to find a suitable partner in Hubei province (especially in Wuhan) to help us complete the online questionnaire. The publicity from the government and media meant that 23.0% of respondents reported they had &quot;some&quot; knowledge of COVID-19, 52.1% had &quot;much&quot; knowledge, and 18.1% had &quot;very much&quot; knowledge. This suggested that the general public had a sufficient understanding of COVID-19. It is important to note that people who knew more about COVID-19 were less likely to experience anxiety, depression, and psychological abnormalities than those with low knowledge. This may be one reason for the low overall anxiety score of the study population. Public understanding of the epidemic is an important consideration for psychological interventions. In addition, the level of public trust in the government and medical institutions, and the level of public anxiety have a significant negative impact. Scientists need to keep working to determine the pathogenesis, treatment, and vaccine development for COVID-19. In addition, the government needs to honestly and correctly report the real epidemic situation to reduce public anxiety, fear, and other negative psychological states; this may help in gaining public trust.\nIt seems natural that people are more prone to anxiety, depression, and fear when facing unknown things or diseases. The more worried people are, the more anxious they become. Anxiety is the fear of expected danger, and panic is the spread of anxiety among a group. In this context, individual anxiety constantly spread through the rapid transmission of information, and evolved into group anxiety and panic. As the number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 increase, the public's psychological state is likely to worsen. However, moderate anxiety could increase awareness of disease prevention and reduce the incidence of disease. A study from Hong Kong noted that a certain level of anxiety could prompt people to take more preventive measures to reduce the speed of SARS transmission. Therefore, some degree of anxiety may not be &quot;bad&quot;. However, addressing moderate anxiety remains difficult. A previous study showed that the H1N1 epidemic threatened the public's physical health, but also caused psychological distress; these results differed based on a series of assessment and coping factors.\nOn January 25, 2020, after most provinces and cities in China successively initiated the level I response to the public health emergency, the government began to intervene in public lives and travel on a large scale. This intervention came with certain &quot;mandatory&quot; requirements. The government required the public to follow specific behaviors. If you do not perform these behaviors, it will be considered a violation of the law. As a result, the majority of respondents followed specific behaviors required by the authorities; 93.3% of our respondents said they &quot;never&quot; went to public places, and 89.6% &quot;never&quot; attended Spring Festival-related activities. Therefore, in our investigation, behavior changes and preventive measures adopted by the public were not related to their psychological status. Regardless of whether it is advisable to restrict individual freedom, such restrictions are beneficial to control further expansion of the epidemic. Previous evidence has shown that encouraging the public to take specific health-related actions is useful to curb epidemics. When an epidemic is under control, it is likely that the psychological status of the general public will naturally return to pre-epidemic status.\nIn our study, the sample was not adjusted to reflect the proportion of the population in terms of gender, age, and region. This was because it was important to evaluate public psychological stress in a timely manner. In addition, there were insufficient respondents from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province. Therefore, we need to be careful in interpreting our results. A second limitation was that we used an online questionnaire survey to reflect the strict measures around social distancing; however, there is no guarantee that the questionnaire responses were not distorted. The third limitation was that the cross-sectional nature of the study means it cannot reflect trends of psychological changes of people in China. Finally, our study found that respondents' state anxiety scores, trait anxiety scores, SDS index scores, and SCL-90 total scores did not exceed the normal range. However, this could be attributable to the lack of sensitivity of the instruments used in this study.\nConclusions\nIn China, public behavior changes and prevention measures are greatly affected by the strong intervention of the Chinese government. The majority of people follow specific behaviors required by the authorities, but it will take time to observe the effects of these behaviors on the epidemic. However, some Chinese people are experiencing anxiety, depression, and other psychological abnormalities during this epidemic. The government needs to pay more attention to the psychological status of the public, especially those aged 19-39 years. This age group appears likely to experience psychological stress when faced with an infectious disease epidemic. Based on the public psychological status during the COVID-19 epidemic, we suggest that policymakers consider making appropriate adjustments to reflect gender and age characteristics when formulating psychological intervention measures. In addition, the government should share as much information as possible with the public, such as knowledge about COVID-19, daily outbreak status, and the government's epidemic prevention strategy; this may help to relieve psychological stress. We hope that this preliminary survey can provide some guidance for psychological interventions for the Chinese population.\nSupplementary information\nAbbreviations\nSARS\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome\nCOVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nSTAI\nState-Trait Anxiety Inventory\nSDS\nSelf-rating Depression Scale\nSCL-90\nSymptom Checklist-90\nXi Liu, Wen-Tao Luo and Ying Li contributed equally to this work.\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s40249-020-00678-3.\nAuthors' contributions\nThe design of the questionnaire was completed by Xi Liu and Wen-Tao Luo; Ying Li was responsible for the examination of the contents of the questionnaire; Chun-Na Li, Zhong-Si Hong, Hui-Li Chen were responsible for the distribution and recovery of the questionnaire; statistical analyses were completed by Fei Xiao; Xi Liu, Wen-Tao Luo and Ying Li jointly completed the first draft of this manuscript; Jin-Yu Xia designed the whole study, provided guidance and reviewed and submitted the article.

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund Limited, Marina Man-Wai Lee, the Hong Kong Hainan Commercial Association South China Microbiology Research Fund, Sanming Project of Medicine (Shenzhen), and High Level-Hospital Program (Guangdong Health Commission).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159286","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper Fuk-Woo","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuofeng","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kin-Hang","surname":"Kok","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelvin Kai-Wang","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hin","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fanfan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jieling","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyril Chik-Yan","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosana Wing-Shan","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hoi-Wah","surname":"Tsoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon Kam-Fai","surname":"Lo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Kwok-Man","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan-Mui","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan Daniel","surname":"Ip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Piao","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Chi-Chung","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Honglin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher Kim-Ming","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth.\n The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation.\n We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0.\n Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.\n The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403–540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18–25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.\n We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49–2.63).\n Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.\n","id":"PMC7074332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Shi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinjun","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangpu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daozhou","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in

to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nWhen an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered.\n\n Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities.\n\n The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities.\n At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down.\n It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities.\n Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma.\n The severity of this epidemic and its long-lasting repercussions

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire.\n\n Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access.\n\n\nIn addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6).\n\n The total Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n The perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level and the number of physical symptoms were associated with higher IES-R Score (P&lt;.\n\n05).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis is one of the first few studies demonstrating the use of Internet in data collection during an air-pollution crisis.\n\n Our results demonstrated that the newer technological modalities have the potential to acquire data, similar to that of conventional technologies.\n\n Demographic variables did not influence the mechanism of usage.\n\n In addition, our findings also suggested that there are acute physical and psychological impacts on the population from an air-pollution crisis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4114481","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR Publications

high acceptance of individuals who already used these apps.\n\n Developing mHealth apps or interventions towards the disease prevention and quality of life improvement could be feasible to proliferate the benefits of such applications in youths and adolescents in Vietnam.\n\n Further research should be conducted to optimize the contents and interfaces of mHealth apps that meet the needs of these populations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6009816","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Toan Thanh

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected

disproportionally mild.\n\n Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease.\n\n A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients.\n\n By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nA coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease.\n\n Serological and molecular tests specific for the virus permitted a definitive laboratory diagnosis to be made and allowed further investigation to define whether other cofactors play a part in disease progression.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112372","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

to compare the strength of associations between different cognitive and affective measures of risk and self-reported protective behaviors in a series of ten cross-sectional surveys conducted throughout the first wave of influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.\n\n\nMethods\nAll surveys were conducted using questionnaire-based telephone interviews, with random digit dialing to recruit adults from the general population.\n\n Measures of anxiety and worry (affective) and perceived risk (cognitive) regarding A/H1N1 were made in 10 serial surveys.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the cognitive/affective-behavioral associations in each survey while multilevel logistic models were conducted to estimate the average effects of each cognitive/affective measure on adoption of protective behaviors throughout the ten surveys.\n\n\nResults\nExcepting state anxiety, other affective measures including “anticipated worry”, “experienced worry” and “current worry” specific to A/H1N1 risk were consistently and strongly associated with adoption of protective behaviors across different survey periods.\n\n However, the cognitive-behavioral associations were weaker and inconsistent across the ten surveys.\n\n Perceived A/H1N1 severity relative to SARS had stronger associations with adoption of protective behaviors in the late epidemic periods than in the early epidemic periods.\n\n\nConclusion\nRisk-specific worries appear to be significantly associated with the adoption of protective behaviors at different epidemic stages, whereas cognitive measures may become more important in understanding people’s behavioral responses later in epidemics.\n\n Future epidemic-related psycho-behavioral research should include more affective-loaded measures of risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3986671","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

based on 28 empirical studies from 30 articles which were published between 2003 and 2007.\nResults\nConcepts of risk perception mostly seemed more pragmatic than theory-based and were highly heterogeneous, for instance, in terms of conceptualizing risk perception as an exclusively cognitive or as a cognitive and emotional phenomenon or whether the concept was dominated by expectancy or expectancy and value components.\n\n Similarly, the majority of studies investigating risk perceptions and protective behaviors were not model-based.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe current body of knowledge can only provide preliminary insights.\n\n Unlike the reviewed studies, which were mostly launched as a rapid response to outbreak situations, future research will have to invest more strongly into

influenza in Australia: Using telephone surveys to measure perceptions of threat and willingness to comply","abstract":"Background\nBaseline data is necessary for monitoring how a population perceives the threat of pandemic influenza, and perceives how it would behave in the event of pandemic influenza.\n\n Our aim was to develop a module of questions for use in telephone health surveys on perceptions of threat of pandemic influenza, and on preparedness to comply with specific public health behaviours in the event of pandemic influenza.\n\n\nMethods\nA module of questions was developed and field tested on 192 adults using the New South Wales Department of Health's in-house Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) facility.\n\n The questions were then modified and re field tested on 202 adults.\n\n The module was then incorporated into the New South Wales Population Health Survey in the first quarter of 2007. A representative sample of 2,081 adults completed the module.\n\n Their responses were weighted against the state population.\n\n\nResults\nThe reliability of the questions was acceptable with kappa ranging between 0.25 and 0.51. Overall 14.9% of the state population thought pandemic influenza was very or extremely likely to occur; 45.5% were very or extremely concerned that they or their family would be affected by pandemic influenza if it occurred; and 23.8% had made some level of change to the way they live their life because of the possibility of pandemic influenza.\n\n In the event of pandemic influenza, the majority of the population were willing to: be vaccinated (75.4%), be isolated (70.2%), and wear a face mask (59.9%).\n\n People with higher levels of threat perception are significantly more likely to be willing to comply with specific public health behaviours.\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile only 14.9% of the state population thought pandemic influenza was very or extremely likely to occur, a significantly higher proportion were concerned for self and family should a pandemic actually occur.\n\n The baseline data collected in this survey will be useful for monitoring changes over time in the population's perceptions of threat, and preparedness to comply with specific public health behaviours.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2556339","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

with greater reported understanding of A/H1N1 cause (??=?0.36) and A/H1N1 prevention self-efficacy (??=?0.25), which in turn were associated with more hand hygiene (??=?0.19 and ??=?0.23,

self-efficacy (??=??0.42) but positively associated with influenza worry (??=?0.44).\n\n Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry (??=?0.16) which was in turn associated with greater social distancing (??=?0.36).\n\n Multigroup comparisons showed gender differences regarding paths from trust in formal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, trust in informal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, and understanding of A/H1N1 cause to perceived self-efficacy.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nTrust in government/media information was more

first case.\n\n Questions examined risk awareness and media use, beliefs about the emergence of the threat and those most at risk, anxiety about infection and preventive and avoidant behaviours.\n\n\nResults\nResults demonstrate moderate levels of anxiety but relatively high levels of trust towards government officials.\n\n Threat emergence was associated with hygiene levels, temperature change, floating pigs in the Huangpu River and migration to the city.\n\n Anxiety predicted both recommended and non-recommended behavioural changes.\n\n\nConclusions\nComparatively high levels of trust in Chinese government advice about H7N9 contrast positively with previous pandemic communications in China.\n\n Anxiety helped drive both recommended and non-recommended behaviours, with potentially important economic and social implications.\n\n This included evidence of 'othering’ of those associated with the threat (e.\n\ng.\n\n migrants).\n\n Findings emphasise the need to manage public communications early during new influenza outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3890621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

impact that many feared, but a rather disproportionate economic impact.\n The disproportionate scale and nature of this impact has caused concern that outbreaks of more serious disease could cause

(H1N1) 2009 among Chinese General Population: a Telephone Survey","abstract":"Background\nChina is at greatest risk of the Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 due to its huge population and high residential density.\n\n The unclear comprehension and negative attitudes towards the emerging infectious disease among general population may lead to unnecessary worry and even panic.\n\n The objective of this study was to investigate the Chinese public response to H1N1 pandemic and provide baseline data to develop public education campaigns in response to future outbreaks.\n\n\nMethods\nA close-ended questionnaire developed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention was applied to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 among 10,669 responders recruited from seven urban and two rural areas of China sampled by using the probability proportional to size (PPS) method.\n\n\nResults\n30.0% respondents were not clear whether food spread H1N1 virusand.\n\n 65.7% reported that the pandemic had no impact on their life.\n\n The immunization rates of the seasonal flu and H1N1vaccine were 7.5% and 10.8%, respectively.\n\n Farmers and those with lower education level were less likely to know the main transmission route (cough or talk face to face).\n\n Female and those with college and above education had higher perception of risk and more compliance with preventive behaviors.\n\n Relationships between knowledge and risk perception (OR = 1.69; 95%CI 1.54-1.86), and knowledge and practices (OR = 1.57; 95%CI 1.42-1.73) were found among the study subjects.\n\n With regard to the behavior of taking up A/H1N1 vaccination, there are several related factors found in the current study population, including the perception of life disturbed (OR = 1.29; 95%CI 1.11-1.50), the safety of A/H1N1 vaccine (OR = 0.07; 95%CI 0.04-0.11), the knowledge of free vaccination policy (OR = 7.20; 95%CI 5.91-8.78), the state's priority vaccination strategy(OR = 1.33; 95%CI 1.08-1.64), and taking up seasonal influenza vaccine behavior (OR = 4.69; 95%CI 3.53-6.23).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis A/H1N1 epidemic has not caused public panic yet, but the knowledge of A/H1N1 in residents is not optimistic.\n\n Public education campaign may take the side effects of vaccine and the knowledge about the state's vaccination strategy into account.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3112099","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Swine-Origin Influenza A(H1N1)","abstract":"Background\nSince late April, 2009, a novel influenza virus A (H1N1), generally referred to as the “swine flu,” has spread around the globe and infected hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n During the first few days after the initial outbreak in Mexico, extensive media coverage together with a high degree of uncertainty about the transmissibility and mortality rate associated with the virus caused widespread concern in the population.\n\n The spread of an infectious disease can be strongly influenced by behavioral changes (e.\n\ng.\n\n, social distancing) during the early phase of an epidemic, but data on risk perception and behavioral response to a novel virus is usually collected with a substantial delay or after an epidemic has run its course.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nHere, we report the results from an online survey that gathered data (n?=?6,249) about risk perception of the Influenza A(H1N1) outbreak during the first few days of widespread media coverage (April 28 - May 5, 2009).\n\n We find that after an initially high level of concern, levels of anxiety waned along with the perception of the virus as an immediate threat.\n\n Overall, our data provide evidence that emotional status mediates behavioral response.\n\n Intriguingly, principal component analysis revealed strong clustering of anxiety about swine flu, bird flu and terrorism.\n\n All three of these threats receive a great deal of media attention and their fundamental uncertainty is likely to generate an inordinate amount of fear vis-a-vis their actual threat.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nOur results suggest that respondents' behavior varies in predictable ways.\n\n Of particular interest, we find that affective variables, such as self-reported anxiety over the epidemic, mediate the likelihood that respondents will engage in protective behavior.\n\n Understanding how protective behavior such as social distancing varies and the specific factors that mediate it may help with the design of epidemic control strategies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2779851","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

study examines how this novel disease threat was depicted in the UK newspapers, using social representations theory and in particular existing work on social representations of HIV/AIDS and Ebola to analyse the meanings of the epidemic.\n It investigates the way that SARS was presented as a dangerous threat to the UK public, whilst almost immediately the threat was said to be ‘contained’ using the mechanism of ‘othering’: SARS was said to be unlikely to personally affect the UK reader because the Chinese were so different to ‘us’; so ‘other’.\n In this sense, the SARS scare, despite the remarkable speed with which it was played out in the modern global news media, resonates with the meanings attributed to other epidemics of infectious diseases throughout history.\n Yet this study also highlights a number of differences in the social representations of SARS compared with earlier epidemics.\n In particular, this study examines the phenomena of ‘emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases’ over the past 30 or so years and suggests that these have impacted on the faith once widely held that Western biomedicine could ‘conquer’ infectious

world.\n\n Previous pandemics have led to stockpiling of goods, the victimisation of particular population groups, and the cancellation of travel and the boycotting of particular foods (e.\n\ng.\n\n pork).\n\n We examined initial behavioural and attitudinal responses towards Influenza A, H1N1 ('Swine flu') in the six days following the WHO pandemic alert level 5, and regional differences in these responses.\n\n\nMethods\n328 respondents completed a cross-sectional Internet or paper-based questionnaire study in Malaysia (N = 180) or Europe (N = 148).\n\n Measures assessed changes in transport usage, purchase of preparatory goods for a pandemic, perceived risk groups, indicators of anxiety, assessed estimated mortality rates for seasonal flu, effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccination, and changes in pork consumption\nResults\n26% of the respondents were 'very concerned' about being a flu victim (42% Malaysians, 5% Europeans, p &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n 36% reported reduced public transport

complementary “infoveillance” approach using Twitter during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.\n\n Our study aimed to: 1) monitor the use of the terms “H1N1” versus “swine flu” over time; 2) conduct a content analysis of “tweets”; and 3) validate Twitter as a real-time content, sentiment, and public attention trend-tracking tool.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nBetween May 1 and December 31, 2009, we archived over 2 million Twitter posts containing keywords “swine flu,” “swineflu,” and/or “H1N1.” using Infovigil, an infoveillance system.\n\n Tweets using “H1N1” increased from 8.8% to 40.5% (R\n2?=?.\n\n788; p&lt;.\n\n001), indicating a gradual adoption of World Health Organization-recommended terminology.\n\n 5,395 tweets were randomly selected from 9 days, 4 weeks apart and coded using a tri-axial coding scheme.\n\n To track tweet content and to test the feasibility of automated coding, we created database queries for keywords and correlated these results with manual coding.\n\n Content analysis indicated resource-related posts were most commonly shared (52.6%).\n\n 4.5% of cases were identified as misinformation.\n\n News websites were the most popular sources (23.2%), while government and health agencies were linked only 1.5% of the time.\n\n 7/10 automated queries correlated with manual coding.\n\n Several Twitter activity peaks coincided with major news stories.\n\n Our results correlated well with H1N1 incidence data.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study illustrates the potential of using social media to conduct “infodemiology” studies for public health.\n\n 2009 H1N1-related tweets were primarily used to disseminate information from credible sources, but were also a source of opinions and experiences.\n\n Tweets can be used for real-time content analysis and

Health\nPurpose\nReducing the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted recommendations for individuals to socially distance.

A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness.\nResults\nAlmost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing. The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick.

Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents' anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness.\nConclusions\nUnderstanding adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing may inform strategies to increase social distancing engagement, reduce pathogen transmission, and identify individual differences in mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nImplications and Contributions\nUsing a large sample of US adolescents recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study found associations among social distancing motivations, degree of social distancing, and mental and social health. Findings hold promise for local governments and parents to understand sources of variation in adolescents' social distancing and mental and social health.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic, and on March 13th, 2020, the United States declared COVID-19 a national emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and has since spread globally, with over 970,000 confirmed cases worldwide as of April 3 and over 210,000 confirmed cases in the United States. To reduce the spread of the virus and lower the risk of overwhelming health systems around the world, one major recommendation from health organizations was to implement social distancing procedures, which involves minimizing social and physical contact between people. Measures to promote social distancing include limiting the size of gatherings, maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between people, closure of nonessential businesses, teleworking, distance learning, and shelter-in-place orders. Past research suggests variability in the rate at which teenagers engaged in social distancing in the week after COVID-19 being declared a US national emergency. Less is known about youths' motivations to engage in social distancing and how these motivations are connected with their social distancing behavior and their mental and social health.\nYouths' motivations or reasons to engage in social distancing may be connected with their social distancing engagement, mental health, and social health. According to the Self-Determination Theory, motivations vary in the degree to which they are controlled (e.g., rule-based) versus autonomous (e.g., volition-based). Autonomous motivations more strongly predict engagement in prosocial behavior than controlled motivations and have been connected with greater mental health benefits. Furthermore, prosocial motivations, including concern for the welfare of others, have also been linked with greater prosocial action and psychological well-being. In the context of social distancing, youth may endorse motives connected with personal autonomy (e.g., not wanting to get personally sick), prosocial action (e.g., not wanting to get others sick), or control (e.g., parental rules, city/state lockdown). Youth motivated by autonomous or prosocial reasons may engage in more social distancing relative to those who are not motivated by these reasons. Furthermore, autonomous and prosocial motivations may be connected with greater mental health among youth who are social distancing.\nUnderstanding the connection among social distancing motivations, mental health, and social health may be especially important for adolescents, who are potentially at risk for negative psychological effects from COVID-19 social distancing. Adolescence is a period associated with increased risk for the development of many psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. In addition, a number of hormonal and neurobiological changes during adolescence correspond with heightened emotional reactivity and the ongoing development of coping strategies and stress regulation. Simultaneously, adolescence is marked by the increased importance of peer relationships and a greater reliance on peers for social support. Peer interactions help contribute to adolescents' social health by enhancing their sense of belonging and reducing a sense of burdensomeness on others, both of which are considered crucial interpersonal needs. Examining connections between social distancing motivations and mental and social health among youth may provide important insight into potential avenues for reducing the psychological consequences of social distancing among this at-risk population.\nThe Present Study\nThe present study had three aims. The first aim was to identify youths' motivations for social distancing. We expected youth to endorse a wide variety of social distancing motivations, including those reflecting personal desires or autonomy (e.g., not wanting to personally get sick), prosocial action (e.g., not wanting others to get sick), and control (e.g., parental or state rules). The second aim was to determine the extent to which different motivations were related to the degree of social distancing. We expected that youth who endorsed autonomy and prosocial motives would engage in social distancing to a greater extent relative to those who did not endorse these motives. The third aim was to examine connections between social distancing motivations and adolescents' mental health and social health. We expected that youth who endorsed autonomous or prosocial motives would report better mental and social health. Past research has found consistent demographic differences in adolescents' mental health, with adolescent girls, minority youth, older youth, and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds having greater anxiety and depressive symptoms. Thus, the present study accounted for these demographic differences to isolate links between social distancing motivations and mental and social health.\nMethod\nParticipants and procedure\nParticipants were 683 adolescents residing in the United States and between the ages of 13 and 18 years (mean = 16.35, standard deviation = 1.13). A minimum sample size of 600 was determined based on past research on motivation in teens, and we oversampled to account for potential publication bias. The sample was primarily 10th (19.7%), 11th (30.6%), or 12th (31.5%) graders with fewer ninth (13.2%) graders and college students (4.0%). The sample was composed of primarily female participants (75.3%) with 22.7% male participants and 4.9% identifying as nonbinary. The sample was primarily white/Caucasian (77.0%), followed by Hispanic/Latino (15.5%), African American/Black (5.6%), Asian American/Pacific Islander (11.1%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (3.2%), or other (2.9%). As a proxy for family financial strain, youth were asked whether their families had enough money to buy almost anything they wanted (7.7%), no problem buying the things they need and can also sometimes buy special things (53.6%), just enough money for the things they need (31.5%), or a hard time buying the things they need (7.2%). All youth reported that their school had been temporarily closed to facilitate social distancing at the time of data collection. A total of 13 youths (1.9%) were missing data on social distancing engagement and motivation and were removed from the sample.\nThis study was advertised on various social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit), and participants self-selected into the study to complete a 10-minute survey. Youth who saw the advertisement, selected into the study, and provided consent were enrolled in the study. Data were collected from 8:00 p.m. on March 29th through 9:00 p.m. on March 30th, 2020. This study involved no more than minimal risk, and thus, a waiver of parental permission was granted. Upon selecting into the study, participants were given a link to a letter explaining the study and asked to provide this letter to their parents to inform them of their participation in the study. All youth who provided informed written consent by selecting that they agree to participate in the research described on the consent form were invited to take the survey. Those who completed the survey were entered into a drawing for a $50 Amazon gift card. This study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at the first author's institution.\nSocial distancing and motivation\nAdolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing\nLabel	Motivation	N	%	 	Social responsibility	It is socially responsible	513	78.1	 	Avoid others sick	I do not want others to get sick	512	77.9	 	Lockdown	My state/city is on lockdown	400	60.9	 	Avoid personal sick	I do not want to personally get sick	380	57.8	 	Parents' rules	My parents are making me	358	54.5	 	Prefer stay home	I prefer to stay at home anyway	140	21.3	 	No alternatives	There is nothing else going on	117	17.8	 	Friends said I should	My friends told me I should	91	13.9	 	Avoid judgment	I do not want to be socially judged	46	7.0	 	Other	Other	29	4.4	 	\nTotal N = 657. Adolescents could select multiple motivations.\nA single item created for the purpose of this study was used to capture the extent to which youth perceived that they were engaging in social distancing. This perception-based assessment of social distancing was used given the lack of validated measures of social distancing, the large degree of heterogeneity in how youth could exercise social distancing, and the relevance of perceived social isolation compared with objective social isolation for mental health. Participants were asked &quot;In the past 7 days, to what extent did you engage in social distancing?&quot; Response options were given on a 5-point scale including 1 (not at all), 2 (a little), 3 (somewhat), 4 (a lot), and 5 (a great deal), with an option to indicate that they did not know what social distancing was. If participants reported engaging in &quot;a little&quot; to &quot;a great deal&quot; of social distancing, they were presented with a list of motivations for social distancing, which was created based on remote online discussion with a small focus group of teens (n = 3). A total of 10 motivations were presented (Table 1 ). Participants were able to select all motivations that applied to them, and an &quot;other&quot; option was provided along with an open-ended text box for teens to provide more information. A small percentage of teens selected &quot;other&quot; (n = 29, 4.4%), and a review of these qualitative responses indicated that each response qualified as one of the other already provided categories, suggesting that most teens' motivations were captured.\nAnxiety symptoms\nAnxiety symptoms were assessed using the short fixed-form 8-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System anxiety scale (alpha = .94). Youth rated their agreement with items (e.g., &quot;In the past 7 days, I felt nervous.&quot;) on a 5-point scale from 1 (never) to 5 (almost always). Mean scores were calculated, with higher values indicating greater anxiety symptoms.\nDepressive symptoms\nDepressive symptoms were assessed using the short fixed-form 8-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System depression scale (alpha = .95). Youth rated their agreement with items (e.g., &quot;In the past 7 days, I felt sad.&quot;) on a 5-point scale from 1 (never) to 5 (almost always). Mean scores were calculated, with higher values indicating greater depressive symptoms.\nBelongingness\nBelongingness was measured with 3 items (alpha = .82) adapted from the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire. Participants rated the extent to which they belong, other people care about them, and they felt like they have many caring and supportive friends on a 7-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely). Mean scores were calculated, with higher values indicating greater feelings of belongingness.\nBurdensomeness\nBurdensomeness was measured with 2 items (r = .71) adapted from the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire. Participants rated the extent to which they currently felt like a burden on society and make things worse for the people in their life on a 7-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely). Mean scores were calculated, with higher values indicating greater feelings of burdensomeness.\nDemographic characteristics\nParticipants reported their age, gender, race, financial strain, and parents' education. Financial strain and parents' education were included as independent markers of socioeconomic status. Financial strain was measured by asking youth &quot;What best describes your family's financial situation?&quot; with nominal responses including (1) we have a hard time buying the things we need; (2) we have just enough money for the things we need; (3) we have no problem buying the things we need, and we can also sometimes buy special things; and (4) we have enough money to buy almost anything we want. Highest level of mothers' and fathers' education were reported with separate items on a 3-point scale including 1 (high school or less), 2 (some college), and 3 (college graduate or more), with the option of indicating &quot;I do not know&quot;, and were combined into one index representing 1 (neither parent attended college), 2 (at least one parent completed some college), and 3 (at least one parent completed college).\nAnalytic technique\nMultiple regressions were used to test the primary study hypotheses. For these analyses, adolescents' social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness were specified as the dependent variables and motivations to engage in social distancing were specified as the primary independent variables. All models included adolescent gender, age, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (family financial strain and parents' education) as covariates, and models predicting mental or social health included social distancing as a covariate. Models were estimated using the lm function in the R statistical program. Low levels of missing data (&lt;6.5%) were estimated using multiple imputation.\nResults\nMeans, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations among study variables are presented in Table S1 (supplemental file). Most youth were engaging in social distancing a lot (26.9%) or a great deal (56.6%), with fewer youth engaging in social distancing somewhat (13.0%) or a little (3.5%). A total of 13 youth (1.9%) indicated that they were not currently social distancing and were thus omitted from the sample (Note that these youth were excluded from our primary models because they were unable to indicate motivations to engage in social distancing, thus introducing a dependency in the data. Sensitivity analyses indicated that including these youth in models predicting mental and social health did not change the pattern of findings.). Our first aim was to descriptively examine adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing. Table 1 displays the frequencies of motivations to engage in social distancing. Youth most commonly referenced prosocial motivations, including social responsibility (78.1%) and not wanting others to get sick (77.9%), to engage in social distancing. Control-based motivations were also common and included being in a city or state on lockdown (60.9%) and parents making youth social distance (54.5%). Fewer youth reported personal motivations, such as not wanting to personally get sick (57.8%), having a preference to stay home (21.3%), or that there are no alternatives (i.e., there is nothing else going on; 17.8%). In addition, some youth indicated that they engaged in social distancing because a friend told them they should (13.9%) or they did not want to be judged by others (7.0%).\nAssociations among adolescents' social distancing, motivations, mental health, and social health\n	Social distancing	Anxiety symptoms	Depressive symptoms	Burdensomeness	Belongingness	 	Estimates	SE	95% CI	Estimates	SE	95% CI	Estimates	SE	95% CI	Estimates	SE	95% CI	Estimates	SE	95% CI	 	Age	.02	.03	-.04, .07	.02	.04	-.06, .09	.00	.04	-.07, .08	-.05	.06	-.16, .07	.03	.05	-.07, .13	 	Gender: female	.09	.08	-.07, .25	.48	.11	.27, .70	.38	.11	.17, .60	.27	.17	-.06, .60	-.23	.15	-.53, .06	 	Race: white	-.21	.08	-.36, -.05	.11	.11	-.10, .32	.11	.10	-.10, .31	.01	.16	-.31, .34	-.05	.15	-.34, .24	 	Hispanic	-.21	.09	-.39, -.02	.12	.12	-.13, .36	.22	.12	-.02, .46	.12	.19	-.26, .50	.03	.17	-.31, .37	 	Financial strain	.07	.05	-.02, .16	-.15	.06	-.27, -.03	-.17	.06	-.29, -.06	-.25	.09	-.44, -.07	.16	.08	-.00, .33	 	Parents' education	.12	.05	.02, .21	-.02	.07	-.15, .11	-.03	.06	-.16, .09	.01	.10	-.19, .21	.24	.09	.06, .42	 	Social distancing	-	-	-	-.03	.09	-.20, .15	-.12	.09	-.28, .05	.00	.14	-.27, .27	.23	.12	-.01, .47	 	Motivation	 	 Lockdown	.20	.06	.07, .33	.02	.09	-.15, .19	.13	.09	-.04, .29	-.01	.13	-.28, .25	-.07	.12	-.31, .17	 	 Parents' rules	.22	.07	.09, .35	.06	.09	-.12, .23	-.01	.09	-.19, .16	-.02	.14	-.29, .25	.28	.12	.03, .52	 	 Friends said I should	-.06	.10	-.25, .13	.11	.13	-.14, .36	.26	.13	.02, .51	.34	.20	-.05, .73	-.06	.18	-.41, .29	 	 Social responsibility	.21	.09	.03, .39	.03	.12	-.21, .27	-.05	.12	-.29, .19	-.35	.19	-.73, .03	.10	.17	-.23, .44	 	 Avoid personal sick	.07	.07	-.07, .21	.19	.10	.01, .38	-.12	.09	-.31, .06	-.32	.15	-.61, -.03	.07	.13	-.19, .33	 	 Avoid others sick	.15	.10	-.04, .34	.24	.13	-.01, .50	.14	.13	-.11, .40	.17	.20	-.22, .57	.25	.18	-.10, .60	 	 No alternatives	-.20	.08	-.36, -.04	-.20	.11	-.41, .02	-.02	.11	-.23, .19	-.17	.17	-.50, .16	.10	.15	-.20, .40	 	 Prefer to stay home	.09	.08	-.06, .25	-.30	.11	-.51, -.09	-.35	.10	-.55, -.14	.03	.16	-.29, .35	-.18	.15	-.46, .11	 	 Avoid judgment	-.24	.12	-.48, .01	.35	.17	.03, .68	.27	.16	-.05, .59	.31	.26	-.20, .81	-.12	.23	-.57, .33	 	R2/R2 adjusted	.139/.118	.105/.083	.080/.057	.044/.020	.055/.031	 	\nBolded values are significant at p &lt; .05.

Only significant effects are displayed.\nOur second aim was to examine links between adolescents' motivations for social distancing and the degree to which they actually engaged in social distancing. Multiple regression analyses accounting for adolescent age, gender, race, ethnicity, financial strain, and parents' education were conducted. Table 2 displays the model estimates, and Figure 1 displays boxplots for all significant effects. Youth who reported engaging in social distancing because their state or city was on lockdown, their parents were making them, and it is socially responsible were found to be engaging in more social distancing than youth who did not endorse these reasons. In addition, youth who reported engaging in social distancing because there are no alternatives were found to be social distancing less than youth who did not endorse this reason.\nOur third aim was to test associations between adolescents' motivations for engaging in social distancing and their mental and social health. Table 2 displays model estimates from four multiple regressions testing these associations accounting for age, gender, race, ethnicity, financial strain, parents' education, and degree of social distancing. Across all models, we did not find evidence of an association between degree of social distancing engagement and any indicator of mental or social health. Youth who were social distancing because they did not want to personally get sick or because they wanted to avoid judgment reported greater anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, those who were social distancing because they would have otherwise preferred to stay home reported less anxiety and depressive symptoms. Youth who engaged in social distancing because a friend told them reported greater depressive symptoms. Youth who were social distancing because they did not want to get personally sick reported lower feelings of burdensomeness, and those who were social distancing because their parents made them reported greater belongingness.\nDiscussion\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a global event that has had unprecedented effects on adolescents' daily lives. Reducing the spread of the virus requires individuals to limit physical contact with others by engaging in social distancing. The purpose of this study was to examine adolescents' motivations for social distancing and how these motivations were connected with their perceived degree of social distancing, mental health, and social health. Youth endorsed a variety of prosocial, control, and autonomous motivations for social distancing, including social responsibility, not wanting to personally get sick or get others sick, complying with state or parental rules and peer recommendations, and because alternative activities were unavailable. These motivations were differentially associated with degree of social distancing, as well as depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness.\nAdolescents most commonly reported engaging in social distancing for prosocial reasons including recognition that social distancing is a social responsibility and to help ensure that others do not get sick. Furthermore, social responsibility motivations were associated with engaging in more social distancing. These findings extend previous research which indicates that adolescents' social responsibility values were associated with greater disinfecting behavior and less hoarding behavior in the week after COVID-19 was declared a US national emergency. In contrast, youth who indicated that they were engaging in social distancing because they lacked alternatives reported less social distancing. Youth motivated by a lack of alternatives may be social distancing only if it is convenient and does not conflict with more appealing experiences. Importantly, youth who reported that they were social distancing because of governmental sanctions or parental rules were also more engaged in social distancing than those who did not endorse these motives. These findings hold promise for the efficacy of local governments and parents to help increase adolescents' compliance with social distancing recommendations.\nAdolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing were associated with their mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, youth who were social distancing to avoid personal illness reported not only greater anxiety but also less burdensomeness. Disease-related threat has been shown to prompt feelings of anxiety in youth, and similar processes may be occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Alternatively, youth who are more anxious may be more focused on their personal health and thus engage in social distancing as means of self-protection. Although speculative, youth who are social distancing to avoid becoming personally sick may also be more concerned or vigilant, prompting less worry from family members and providing them with a lower sense of burdensomeness. Youth who engaged in social distancing to avoid social judgment reported more anxiety symptoms, and those who were social distancing because of friends' recommendations reported greater depressive symptoms. Past research shows that symptomatic youth are more sensitive to social judgment or peer rejection, which might explain these findings. Our findings highlight how connections between depressive symptoms and social judgments among youth may unfold during a time of heightened social distancing.\nNotably, we did not find evidence that control motivations for social distancing (i.e., government or parental rules) were negatively associated with mental or social health. Rather, youth who reported social distancing because of parental rules also reported feeling a greater sense of belongingness. Parental monitoring is generally positively correlated with greater warmth. Potentially, youth may interpret parental rules about social distancing as a reflection of warmth, caring, and concern for their well-being. It is also possible that youth with a greater sense of belonging are more likely to follow parental rules.\nIt is important to highlight that a subset of youth (25%) reported that they were social distancing because they would prefer to stay home regardless of whether social distancing policies and recommendations were in place. Youth who reported that they would prefer to stay home also reported lower anxiety and depressive symptoms, relative to those who did not report this motivation. It is possible that youth who prefer staying home may be struggling less with reduced social contact. Conversely, youth who did not indicate that they would prefer to stay home (suggesting that they would rather be engaged in social activity outside of their home) may be at the greatest risk for experiencing anxiety or depressive symptoms. Future research is needed to examine the long-term impact of social distancing on the mental and social health of these youth.\nLimitations and future directions\nFindings should be interpreted in the context of certain limitations. Data were cross-sectional, and causal or temporal interpretations cannot be made. Future research is needed to examine within-person, longitudinal associations between social distancing, motivation, and mental and social health. Social distancing may be connected with within-person change in mental health across time as youth experience a longer duration of social distancing. Although our sample was recruited from across the United States, participants self-selecting into this study via social media may be prone to selection bias. Furthermore, youth were primarily white and female, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Future studies would benefit from examining social distancing motivation in a more diverse sample of youth.\nResearchers have highlighted that motivation is multidimensional and includes beliefs about a person's ability to engage in an activity, reasons for engagement, and emotional reactions related to the activity. The measure of motivation used in this study was based on past research and primarily focused on reasons for engagement; future research would benefit from capturing the multidimensional nature of adolescents' motivations for social distancing. In addition, this study did not capture adolescents' reasons for not engaging in social distancing, and future research may benefit from understanding why some youth are not social distancing to a greater degree. Social distancing was measured using a single item that captured youths' perception of whether they were social distancing. Although perception-based measures were used given the relevance of perceived social isolation for mental health, it is unknown how these perceptions align with objective social distancing or whether the single item captures engagement in multiple forms of social distancing. Future research is needed to examine multiple facets of youths' social distancing using validated measures. The burdensomeness and belongingness measures used in this study were adapted for repeated assessment and were composed of only a few items, and social health may be better assessed using a larger battery of questions.\nDespite these limitations, our findings have important implications for parents, educators, and policy makers. Specifically, our findings highlight that social distancing may be more or less problematic for youth depending on their reason for engagement. Parents, educators, and policy makers may benefit from understanding why teens are social distancing, present alternative reasons to social distance, or help guide motivations in a way that might promote compliance. Overall, our findings highlight that adolescents have varied motivations for complying with social distancing recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic and that these motivations may be indicative of individual differences in how social distancing may impact teens. Future research should explore moderators of these associations between mental health and experiences with social distancing or isolation from peers (e.g., introversion/extraversion). It will be important to continue to monitor teens' motivations for social distancing and their connections with compliance and mental health as these associations may change as the pandemic evolves and social distancing may occur for an extended duration.\nReferences\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report - 62\nProclamation on declaring a national emergency concerning the novel

recent years, and methods to improve the reliability and validity of PRO instruments are advancing.\n\n This paper discusses the cognitive interviewing procedures employed by the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pediatrics group for the purpose of developing a dynamic, electronic item bank for field testing with children and adolescents using novel computer technology.\n\n The primary objective of this study was to conduct cognitive interviews with children and adolescents to gain feedback on items measuring physical functioning, emotional health, social health, fatigue, pain, and asthma-specific symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 88 cognitive interviews were conducted with 77 children and adolescents across two sites on 318 items.\n\n From this initial item bank, 25 items were deleted and 35 were revised and underwent a second round of cognitive interviews.\n\n A total of 293 items were retained for field testing.\n\n\nResults\nChildren as young as 8 years of age were able to comprehend the majority of items, response options, directions, recall period, and identify problems with language that was difficult for them to understand.\n\n Cognitive interviews indicated issues with item comprehension on several items which led to alternative wording for these items.\n\n\nConclusion\nChildren ages 8–17 years were able to comprehend most item stems and response options in the present study.\n\n Field testing with the resulting items and response options is presently being conducted as part of the PROMIS Pediatric Item Bank development process.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2642767","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Debra

Midwest pediatric nephrology consortium study","abstract":"Background and objectives\nNephrotic syndrome (NS) represents a common disease in pediatric nephrology typified by a relapsing and remitting course and characterized by the presence of edema that can significantly affect the health-related quality of life in children and adolescents.\n\n The PROMIS pediatric measures were constructed to be publically available, efficient, precise, and valid across a variety of diseases to assess patient reports of symptoms and quality of life.\n\n This study was designed to evaluate the ability of children and adolescents with NS to complete the PROMIS assessment via computer and to initiate validity assessments of the short forms and full item banks in pediatric NS.\n\n Successful measurement of patient reported outcomes will contribute to our understanding of the impact of NS on children and adolescents.\n\n\nDesign\nThis cross-sectional study included 151 children and adolescents 8-17 years old with NS from 16 participating institutions in North America.\n\n The children completed the PROMIS pediatric depression, anxiety, social-peer relationships, pain interference, fatigue, mobility and upper extremity functioning measures using a web-based interface.\n\n Responses were compared between patients experiencing active NS (n?=?53) defined by the presence of edema and patients with inactive NS (n?=?96) defined by the absence of edema.\n\n\nResults\nAll 151 children and adolescents were successfully able to complete the PROMIS assessment via computer.\n\n As hypothesized, the children and adolescents with active NS were significantly different on 4 self-reported measures (anxiety, pain interference, fatigue, and mobility).\n\n Depression, peer relationships, and upper extremity functioning were not different between children with active vs.\n\n inactive NS.\n\n Multivariate analysis showed that the PROMIS instruments remained sensitive to NS disease activity after adjusting for demographic characteristics.\n\n\nConclusions\nChildren and adolescents with NS were able to successfully complete the PROMIS instrument using a web-based interface.\n\n The computer based pediatric PROMIS measurement effectively discriminated between children and adolescents with active and inactive NS.\n\n The domain scores found in this study are consistent with previous reports investigating the health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with NS.\n\n This study establishes known-group validity and feasibility for PROMIS pediatric measures in children and adolescents with NS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3599189","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Debbie

life for children with severe obesity","abstract":"Background\nChildhood obesity is a growing health concern known to adversely affect quality of life in children and adolescents.\n\n The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pediatric measures were developed to capture child self-reports across a variety of health conditions experienced by children and adolescents.\n\n The purpose of this study is to begin the process of validation of the PROMIS pediatric measures in children and adolescents affected by obesity.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pediatric PROMIS instruments were administered to 138 children and adolescents in a cross-sectional study of patient reported outcomes in children aged 8–17 years with age-adjusted body mass index (BMI) greater than the 85th percentile in a design to establish known-group validity.\n\n The children completed the depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, peer relationships, pain interference, fatigue, upper extremity, and mobility PROMIS domains utilizing a computer interface.\n\n PROMIS domains and individual items were administered in random order and included a total of 95 items.\n\n Patient responses were compared between patients with BMI 85 to?&lt;?99th percentile versus???99th percentile.\n\n\nResults\n136 participants were recruited and had all necessary clinical data for analysis.\n\n Of the 136 participants, 5% ended the survey early resulting in missing domain scores at the end of survey administration.\n\n In multivariate analysis, patients with BMI???99th percentile had worse scores for depressive symptoms, anger, fatigue, and mobility (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n Parent-reported exercise was associated with better scores for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and fatigue (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions\nChildren and adolescents ranging from overweight to severely obese can complete multiple PROMIS pediatric measures using a computer interface in the outpatient setting.\n\n In the 5% with missing domain scores, the missing scores were consistently found in the domains administered last, suggesting the length of the assessment is important.\n\n The differences in domain scores found in this study are consistent with previous reports investigating the quality of life in children and adolescents with obesity.\n\n We show that the PROMIS instrument represents a feasible and potentially valuable instrument for the future study of the effect of pediatric obesity on quality of life.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3598567","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"David
