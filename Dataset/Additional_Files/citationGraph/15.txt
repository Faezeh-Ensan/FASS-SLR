It spread rapidly also in Italy causing a wide morbidity and mortality, especially in Lombardy region. This new coronavirus can reveal itself with different symptoms and intensities, depending on the age group, the presence of pathologies, the timeliness of the diagnosis and other factors.\nAt our Emergency Department of the Crema Hospital, from the beginning of the pandemic until the end of June 2020 and from the analysis of the general chronology of the data collected so far and still under consideration for validation, access to the Emergency Department of cases attributable to SARS - CoV - 2 infection, confirmed and suspected (based on the symptoms, the lung CT picture and the nasopharyngeal swab), were 4343 equal to 4.6% of the cases of Lombardy Region; considering in our reality a catchment area of about 168,000 people, the prevalence was equal to about 25.8 cases for 1000 inhabitants.\nOf these confirmed and suspected patients, 2590 patients (59.64%) were discharged and put in home isolation, 1369 patients (31.52%) were hospitalized, 274 patients (6.31%) were transferred to others hospitals, 110 patients (2.53%) died in emergency areas and 171 patients (12.4%) died in the ward; in this regard, the deceased patients were 190 males (67.62%) and 91 females (32.38%) of which 10 patients under 60 years (3.56%), 25 patients between 60 and 70 years (8,90%), 99 patients between 70 and 80 years (35.23%), 120 patients between 80 and 90 years (42.70%) and 27 patients over 90 years (9.61%).\nIn this work we took into consideration the clinical course and the outcomes of 54 consecutive patients (3.9%) admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and suffering from severe respiratory insufficiency attributable to viral SARS - CoV - 2 infection, with comparison of data between survivors and deceased. The main aim is to analyze and to share data at according to a critical review of the tests and in order to optimize the most dedicated clinical and treatment strategy for a future 'targeted' management if there will be an effective return of the outbreak.\nMethods\nAt our Emergency Department of the Crema Hospital, from the start of the pandemic until the end of June 2020, 54 consecutive patients (3.9%) were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) suffering from severe acute respiratory infection (SARI).) and severe respiratory distress (ARDS) attributable to viral SARS - CoV - 2 infection. Dyspnoic and hypoxic patients were hospitalized in whom the onset of symptoms varied between 1 and 14 days. The general reference parameters were SpO2 &lt;= 92%, respiratory rate &gt;= 28 acts per minute and a p/F ratio &lt;= 300; further recruitment criteria were the general status (performance status) and clinical impairment, comorbidities and CT images. Of these patients 44 were male (81.5%) while 10 were female (18.5%), of which 1 patient (1 man) between 30 and 39 years (1.85%), 7 patients (6 men and 1 woman) between 40 and 49 years (13%), 11 patients (10 men and 1 woman) between 50 and 59 years (20.3%), 20 patients (14 men and 6 women) between 60 and 69 years (37, 1%), 14 patients (12 men and 2 women) between 70 and 79 years (25.9%) and 1 patient (1 man) between 80 and 89 years (1.85%).\nAll patients presented SARS CoV - 2 nasopharyngeal swab with Real Time PCR testing, complete blood chemistry, serial blood gas analysis, and chest CT scan. Gold tracheal intubation (IOT) was performed in 48 patients (88.8%) while 6 patients (11.2%) were treated only with non-invasive support ventilation (NIV); the IOT was sudden, or in any case performed within the 24 h from the access to the ICU, in 25 patients (4 women and 21 men) equal to 52%, while in the other 23 patients (6 women and 17 men) it was practiced after 24 h of non-invasive ventilation, equal to 48%; 3 patients underwent tracheostomy (6%).\nAll patients were given antibiotic, prophylactic or targeted therapy, and low molecular weight heparin therapy, 48 patients received support therapy with cortisone drugs, 50 patients were treated with the off-label compassionate therapy protocol with antivirals whilst 44 patients received hydroxychloroquine therapy, the protocol with tolicizumab was applied in 3 patients. The synergistic treatment of comorbidities present in 28 patients (51.8%) was not overlooked, the hepato-renal, neurological and metabolic complications were extremely treated, and some cases of ventilation-induced lung complications were also managed (VILI).\nResults\nThe ICU patient admission time interval was between 1 and 56 days, with an average of 28 days in hospital; with a prevalence of male patients, the most significant age group is between 60 and 69 years (37.1%). Of these ICU patients, there were 21 deaths (D) equal to about 38% and, compared to the survivors (S), the deceased ones were older with an average age of about 67 years (vs an average age of the survivors of about 59 years).\nAs from the data collected when patients entered the ICU, body temperature was in a range between 33,3 and 39 degrees Celsius for patients who then died and between 36 and 39.2 degrees Celsius for patients who then survived, the average PCR dosage (VN = 0-5) was 14,27 mg/dl for the former and 12,86 mg/dl for the latter, while the D-Dimer dosage (VN = 0,0-0,5 mug/ml) was elevated in 21 patients out of 25 available dosages, with an average concentration of 1,85 mug/ml in the patients died compared to an average concentration of 1,24 mug/ml in patients who later survived. The surviving patients presented on average better oximetry and blood gas values compared to the patients who died (S: SpO2 92% vs D: SpO2 86% - S: pO2 50.5 mmHg vs D: pO2 46.9 mmHg - S: p/F ratio 240 vs D: p/F ratio 223).\nAs from the CT scan of the chest, all patients had bilateral pulmonary impairment, the worsening of the ARDS occurred in 31 patients (57.4%). 8 patients were transferred to other hospitals, of which 2 patients underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for hypoxemia refractory to invasive protective mechanical ventilation.\nAmong intubated patients 21 patients (including 3 women and 18 men) died at 56 days, all suffering from worsening ARDS. Among the deaths, 10 patients had an ICU stay of more than 10 days. 9 patients died out of 25 patients intubated early or in any case within 24 h of access to the ICU, while 12 patients died out of 23 patients where intubation was practiced after 24 h of ventilation. Non-invasive (NIV) which has become ineffective for the subsequent clinical worsening of the patient; of these two groups, the calculation of the average time from admission to the emergency room to admission to intensive care was approximately 120 h in both groups. There was no mortality in the 6 patients who underwent non-invasive ventilation alone.\nThe presence of multiple comorbidities was present on 17 deceased patients on 28 patients affected by these and represented an additional unfavorable prognostic factor; specifically for pre-existing diseases, 26 patients with 0 pathologies (4 D), 3 patients with 1 pathology (1 D), 11 patients with 2 pathologies (6 D), 13 patients with 3 pathologies (9 D) and 1 patient with 4 pathologies (1 D).\nAs regards complications, more than one complication occurred in the same patient during the ICU admission. After respiratory worsening, renal failure was more frequently found in 16 patients (29.6%) where there were 13 deaths; of the patients with renal insufficiency, including 2 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, 7 patients also had liver failure and 6 patients experienced an evolution of the clinical state in sepsis. Specific complications such as lesions induced by ventilation with a barotrauma mechanism (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema) were found in 6 complicated cases, ischemic heart disease in 3 complicated cases, the appearance of both central neurological events of sensory changes in 5 complicated cases, meningo - encephalitis in 2 complicated cases, cerebral hemorrhage in 1 complicated case, and peripheral neurological events with neuropathy in 2 complicated cases and with paresis in 3 complicated cases.\nNotes of physiopathology\nThe respiratory system is the preferential pathway of the virus which, following the inhalation of droplets and the binding of the virus with the receptors type ACE2 of the broncho-alveolar mucosa, invades the bronchial epithelium, the alveolar epithelial cell and endothelial cells, resulting in a severe alteration of the capillary alveolus membrane; subsequently, it inhibits the immune response and continues systemic diffusion.\nAs can be seen from the literature data, the pulmonary pathological process corresponds to diffuse alveolar damage (where the ground glass density is its radiological representation), accompanied by thrombotic microangiopathy (microvascular pulmonary thrombosis) and associated foci of alveolar hemorrhage up to a more general organ failure, up to the proliferative phase of lung consolidation, interstitial and intralobular fibrosis. Although the reasons for these hemostatic changes are still under study, that is, if they are a consequence of a 'superinflammation' or are due to the mediated effect of the coronavirus, in patients with SARS - CoV - 2 the theory seems to be demonstrated where the pathological process lung starts with a high production of early response proinflammatory cytokines, type IL-1, IL-6, IL-7 and TNFalpha, which would thus confer a hyperinflammatory cascade state with damage to microvascularization and endothelial damage/dysfunction, haemostatic aggregation changes platelet and thrombus generation within pulmonary vascularization. In fact, the patients in critical conditions affected by this disease are the ones to have a high risk of thromboembolism. Therefore a higher risk of death, in relation to immobility, the inflammatory state induced by viral infection, platelet activation, dysfunction endothelial with activation of plasminogen and blood flow stasis, develop coagulation anomalies and define a state of systemic coagulopathy. This form of disseminated intravascular coagulation, as a basic hematological characteristic, seems to be confirmed by the combination of an increase in D-Dimer concentration, a reduction in the platelet count and an extension of the prothrombin time in patients severely affected by SARS - CoV - 2, values increasingly prevalent if the disease is in its evolutionary phase; other relevant laboratory anomalies are the increase in lactate dehydrogenase or LDH and ferritin. In these serious patients, if the concentration of D - Dimer greater than 1 mg/L seems to have entailed an 18 times greater risk of death, mild thrombocytopenia (70-95% of affected patients) does not currently seem to be a specific predictor of the disease progression.\nConsiderations\nSARS - CoV - 2 disease is caused by a new coronavirus that has its main route of transmission through respiratory droplets and close contact, resulting in a sudden onset clinical syndrome of acute respiratory infection (SARI) with at least one fever symptom, dry cough or wheezing; on the other hand, in relation to the different clinical symptoms with which it can occur, such as respiratory pneumonia of rapidly progressive pneumonia or with gastrointestinal or neurological prevalence, this disease can be considered a multisystem phenotype whose natural history we do not know well yet.\nIn this retrospective observational study, 54 consecutive patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) suffering from severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and severe respiratory distress (ARDS) were recruited in certain or suspected manner to be explicit SARS - CoV - 2 coronavirus.\nUnlabelled Table	 	\nReference values blood  gas analysisDEATHS	Reference valuesblood gas analysisSURVIVORS	 	SpO2: 86%	SpO2 92%	 	pO2: 46,9 mmHg	pO2 50,5 mmHg	 	p/F ratio: 223 mmHg	p/F ratio 240 mmHg	 	Lactates: 2,06 mmol/L	Lactates: 1,4 mmol/L	 	Respiratory and Metabolic Alkalosis88.8% of patients	Respiratory and Metabolic Alkalosis78.7% of patients	 	\nThe simplified comparison chart A, for patients entering the ICU, shows the average reference values of the blood gas analysis between those who survived and died; in the latter the reference values are worse and hyperlactacidemia is present.\nSpO2 (V.N.: 94-97%) - pO2 (V.N.: 83-108 mmHg) - p/F ratio (V.N. &gt;= 350 mmHg) - Lactates (V.N.: 0.5-1.6 mmol/L).\nRegarding the recruitment criterion, their access to the ICU was provided for dyspnoic patients with hypoxic respiratory insufficiency. The patients were assessed on the basis of different variables such as the status of the general conditions (performance status) and clinical impairment, comorbidities and Tac images, also considering general reference parameters such as a SpO2 &lt;= 92% in ambient air, a tachypnea with respiratory rate &gt;= 28 acts per minute and a ratio between partial pressure and inspiratory fraction of oxygen PaO2/FiO2 &lt;= 300 mmHg (mild hypoxemia with value &lt;=300, moderate with value &lt;=200 and severe with value &lt;=100). As shown in the simplified comparison chart A, among all ICU candidate patients, those who survived presented, on an average, have better blood gas values than the patients who died; these reference values could guide the clinical outcome and prognosis. \nUnlabelled Table	 	\nType and Extension oflung lesions (bilateral)--------------------Onset of symptoms and radiology--------------------DEATHS	Type and Extension oflung lesions (bilateral)--------------------Onset of symptoms and radiology--------------------SURVIVORS	 	Type 3Dfrom 3 to 15 days(7 patients)	Type 3Dfrom 3 to 9 days(4 patients)	 	Type 3Cfrom 4 to 7 days(4 patients)	Type 3Cfrom 3 to 10 days(6 patients)	 	Type 3Bfrom 3 to 14 days(2 patients)	Type 3Bfrom 4 to 6 days(3 patients)	 	**********	Type 2Dfrom 1 to 12 days(6 patients)	 	Type 2Cfrom 3 to 7 days(6 patients)	Type 2Cfrom 1 to 14 days(6 patients)	 	Type 2Bfrom 3 to 10 days(2 patients)	Type 2Bfrom 3 to 9 days(7 patients)	 	**********	Type 2Ato 5 days(1 patient)	 	\nSimplified classification B. The different types of lesions and the pulmonary compromise of patients undergoing pulmonary CT of the ICU patients are reported. Both the variability of the type and extent of lung lesions and the variability of radiological findings in relation to the onset of symptoms are shown.\nLegend:\nPulmonary parenchyma involvement: bilateral.\nLung injury: 1. Absence of injury 2. Presence of ground glass lesions without consolidation areas 3. Presence of ground glass lesions with consolidation areas 4. Presence of consolidation areas.\n(consolidation: parenchyma filled with inflammatory cell exudate in the pulmonary alveoli)\n- Lung injury extension: A. Minimal (1-25%) B. Medium (26-50%) C. Moderate (51-75%) D. Severe (76-100%).\nAll patients performed SARS CoV - 2 nasopharyngeal swab with Real Time PCR tests, blood chemistry, serial blood gas analysis, and chest CT scan. In this regard, as shown in a simplifying manner in classification B, as regards the first chest tomographic, in the later deceased patients, an extension of the 3D and 2C type lesions was found with a prevalence of severe and moderate forms, whilst in the surviving patients the extension appears to be prevalent for the medium and moderate forms. If, on the one hand, the type and extent of lung lesions were distributed variably in all patients entering the ICU, just as the radiological findings were variable in relation to the onset of symptoms, on the other, the subsequent mortality was greater not only in those patients with worse 3D radiological severity, but also in type 2C, or where the number of comorbidities present, on average equal to 2 pathologies for each group, was similar between these groups; in this regard, it appears likely to expect a negative prognostic evolution if the presence of multiple comorbidities, the clinical worsening of respiratory distress and systemic complications in the subsequent stages are associated. \nWith a prevalence of male patients, the most represented age group in ICU was between 60 and 69 years, the worsening of the ARDS occurred in 31 patients, the average hospitalization time was 28 days and the calculation of the average time from the admission at the emergency room and the admission at intensive care was approximately 120 h. Tracheal gold intubation was practiced in most patients, whilst 6 patients were treated only with non-invasive support ventilation, i.e. in those patients who did not shown clinical deterioration; among intubated patients, 21 patients all with worsening ARDS died, whilst there was precisely no mortality in patients subjected to non-invasive ventilation alone.\nAll our patients have received empirical or targeted antibiotic therapy as needed, for the prevention and control of infections of potential pathogens responsible for severe respiratory failure, together with low molecular weight heparin therapy. The majority of patients were also treated with the off - label compassionate therapy protocol with antivirals, such as the one for hydroxychloroquine therapy, while under cortisone therapy under surveillance, although under conditions of clinical deterioration and ARDS, its effectiveness may be controversial. The anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody protocol (Tolicizumab) was applied in 3 patients with severe respiratory distress and instability. In fact, based on evidence, starting from the assumption that this multifunctional cytokine (acute phase protein) is the mediator of fever and systemic inflammatory response for severe forms, some research displayed the correlation between inflammation and lung damage induced by cytokine release with the clinical evolution of rapidly progressive pneumonia in critically ill patients; therefore, significant differences were found in the serum expression of IL-6 receptor levels in the different disease stages with levels of this cytokine significantly higher in patients with severe disease than in patients presenting mild symptoms.\nAs from the data collected on entry to the ICU, the average PCR dosage was 14.27 mg/dl for patients who died and 12.86 mg/dl for patients who survived, the dosage of D-Dimer was increased and had an average concentration of 1.85 mug/ml in patients who died compared to an average concentration of 1.24 mug/ml of patients who survived. Multiple comorbidities were present in 17 deceased patients out of 28 affected patients including cerebral vasculopathy, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic bronchopathy, renal failure, high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis, obstructive apnea syndrome OSAS, obesity, immunodepression and neoplasms.\nSome general considerations apply in this regard.\nAlthough most SARS - CoV - 2 patients have predominantly a respiratory tract infection, in these cases a part of the patients evolve towards a serious form of systemic disease, i.e. from acute lung damage we move on to venous and arterial thromboembolic complications and multi-organ failure, mostly associated with high mortality; in particular, it is clear that pneumonia, respiratory failure and sepsis, including myocardiopathies and neuropathies, represent serious complications among patients hospitalized for this virus, therefore the possibility of developing systemic diseases and multi-organ failure is high. Furthermore, starting from the assumption that the evaluation of comorbidities serves to adapt the treatment of the critically ill patient and therefore to allow to formulate a prognosis, the heterogeneity of the respiratory syndromes and the presence of multiple comorbidities represent an unfavorable prognostic factor. Furthermore, in patients with sudden respiratory deterioration, and high blood concentrations of D - Dimer, pulmonary embolism may be the cause. In fact, pending further studies, the recommendations are to monitor hemostatic markers (D - Dimer, Prothrombin Time and Platelet Count) in patients with SARS - CoV - 2, adopting in the prevention of coagulopathy, and therefore in term to reduce mortality, the systematic use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), with the dual anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory effect, unless there are no contraindications (other anticoagulants, such as Antithrombin III or complement inhibitors, are still being tested).\nAs regards complications, more than one complication occurred in the same patient during the ICU admission. After the respiratory worsening, renal failure was more frequently found, then liver failure and sepsis. Some particular complications have been found such as lesions induced by ventilation with a barotrauma mechanism (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema), ischemic heart disease, the appearance of central neurological manifestations of sensory alterations, meningo - encephalitis and cerebral hemorrhage, and of peripheral neurological manifestations with polyneuro - myopathies (CRIMYNE or CRitical Illness MYopathy and NEuropathy), conditions often associated with multiorgan failure. In this regard, further preliminary research observations are starting to take shape in the meantime, such as the identification of the genetic mutations (genetic susceptibility) underlying the serious neurological complications caused by this virus, as they seem to make some people highly vulnerable to viral infections.\nAs regards lung complications, the ventilation-induced damage (VILI) with the barotrauma mechanism represented a side effect that affected 6 complicated cases. As reported in the literature, the iatrogenic effect of ventilation, which relaxes an already pathological lung, adversely affects through a mechanical stress mechanism with a high tidal volume, followed by a biological response with activation of inflammation mediators and subsequently the achievement of the rupture limit of alveolar walls and pulmonary capillaries. The objective to be pursued in an emergency, also in order to limit VILI damage, should be to prefer the use of a contained tidal volume (6-8 ml/kg of ideal weight and depending on the degree of hypoxemia) and to contain the driving pressure (without exceeding 15 cmH2O), the latter regulating it with the application of a 'modulated' PEEP according to the case (allows a more uniform distribution of stress), that is, testing different plateau pressure values, a parameter mostly related to pressure transpulmonary, or pulmonary distension force, and not at tidal volume. On one side it is to be provided that mechanical ventilation can adversely affect the prognosis due to lung damage induced, in a mortality rate that is already high in those patients who generally have ARDS, on the other side protective ventilation remains the necessary care during severe hypoxia in patients with SARS - CoV - 2. The essential prerequisite is to be the search for optimal 'personalized' values as conditions can vary from patient to patient and, in the same patient, during different times of ventilation. Furthermore, further studies are underway on the prevention of VILI such as the evaluation of the two phenotypes of patients with SARS - CoV - 2 pneumonia, type L (high compliance) and type H (severe ARDS).\nAs from the reported data, it is therefore evident that mortality can be high in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who access the ICU. In the reported series, patients with an average age of about 67 years (vs an average survivor age of about 59 years) and with multiple comorbidities were the subjects most at risk of death; the associated conditions of sepsis, cardiopathies and neuropathies, as well as the situation of VILI damage, have further complicated the intensive clinical management of patients already suffering from a pathological lung for ARDS.\nWe believe that further studies are needed for this heterogeneity of clinical pictures so that, targeted therapies can be obtained and therefore will meet the needs of individual patients.\nConclusions\nThe SARS - CoV - 2 outbreak put a strain on our emergency and intensive care units, exceptional measures to contain this disease, which led to an overcoming of the effective capacity of the hospital and of the places in ICU also for long hospital stays had to be activated. In these extraordinary circumstances, our reality was among the most affected but withstood the impact thanks to the great immediate response put in place by the operators, although it cost a lot of effort especially to try to guarantee a high quality level of assistance and care compared to the huge wave of number of serious patients.\nAt the beginning just, little was known about the natural history, virulence, infectivity and lethality of the disease but during this challenge many 'lessons' were learned on the management of this clinical spectrum. Let's not forget that this emergency triggered collaborative efforts and impressive therapeutic interventions, where it was necessary to quickly train a part of the healthcare personnel involved and teach them the multiple management procedures (airway, sedation and analgesia, treatment with oxygen therapy, ventilatory and hemodynamic support) in order to have an 'intensive' approach such as to give rapid and adequate diagnostic and therapeutic responses for the local emergency.\nAt the time of the pandemic, although a standardization of procedures and specific protocols was adopted, the lack of certain procedures and targeted therapies for this unknown pathology influenced some aspects of the clinical management of these patients by virtue of the critical and heterogeneous conditions and particular therapeutic needs they require. On the other hand, the treatment for SARS -CoV - 2 infection has taught us a lot, for example, on the need to exploit as much as possible the interventions with proven benefits, such as protective lung ventilation for severe acute respiratory distress, i.e. limit the use of particular interventions that could instead cause damage.\nFurther research on this pathology, such as data collection and sharing and a critical review of the evidence, or identifying patients at high risk of severe respiratory distress and the key elements of intensive treatment, will be useful in order to get a clinical decision-making process and care treatment more specified, where resource planning also becomes essential to deal with any new disease outbreak.\nDeclaration\nThe Authors transfer ownership of the copyright to the American Journal Emergency Medicine in the event that their work is published in the same Magazine.

and no research on the effectiveness of treatment options.\n\n The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nIn response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients.\n\n We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria.\n\n In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria.\n\n Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture.\n\n In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm.\n\n Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive.\n\n In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm.\n\n\nConclusions\nDespite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak.\n\n Some may have been harmful.\n\n Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and to accrue data in real time during future outbreaks to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1564166","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Lauren J","surname":"Stockman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Bellamy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Garner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Donald","surname":"Low","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Donald","surname":"Low","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa1211721","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature12005","date":"2013-02-13","title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature12005) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7095326","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"V.

treatments and preventive measures.\n\n Here, we investigated the spectrum of immune responses occurring in patients with MERS during the early period of infection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe obtained peripheral blood samples from 27 hospitalized patients recruited during the epidemic that occurred in 2015 in South Korea.\n\n Plasma cytokines/chemokines and antibodies were quantified.\n\n Virus-specific T cells were examined by intracellular cytokine staining after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with overlapping peptides spanning whole virus structural proteins.\n\n\nResults\nAt the acute phase of infection, elevated levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines were detected in proportion to the severity of the disease.\n\n Distinctively high frequencies of MERS coronavirus–reactive CD8+ T cells were also observed in patients with severe/moderate illness, whereas antibody and CD4+ T-cell responses were minimally detected at this stage.\n\n At the convalescent phase, disease severity–dependent antibody responses emerged and antigen-reactive cells were identified in both T-cell subsets.\n\n These T cells belonged to the T-helper 1 or type 1 cytotoxic T cell subtypes.\n\n While CD8+ T cells responded preferentially to the viral S protein compared with E/M/N proteins, especially at the acute stage, slightly more CD4+ T

systemic cytokine and antibody levels in evaluating differences in early immune response in both mild and severe patients infected with nvH1N1.\nMethods\nWe profiled 29 cytokines and chemokines and evaluated the haemagglutination inhibition activity as quantitative and qualitative measurements of host immune responses in serum obtained during the first five days after symptoms onset, in two cohorts of nvH1N1 infected patients.\n\n Severe patients required hospitalization (n = 20), due to respiratory insufficiency (10 of them were admitted to the intensive care unit), while mild patients had exclusively flu-like symptoms (n = 15).\n\n A group of healthy donors was included as control (n = 15).\n\n Differences in levels of mediators between groups were assessed by using the non parametric U-Mann Whitney test.\n\n Association between variables was determined by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient.\n\n Viral load was performed in serum by using real-time PCR targeting the neuraminidase gene.\n\n\nResults\nIncreased levels of innate-immunity mediators (IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1?), and the absence of anti-nvH1N1 antibodies, characterized the early response to nvH1N1 infection in both hospitalized and mild patients.\n\n High systemic levels of type-II interferon (IFN-?) and also of a group of mediators involved in the development of T-helper 17 (IL-8, IL-9, IL-17, IL-6) and T-helper 1 (TNF-?, IL-15, IL-12p70) responses were exclusively found in hospitalized patients.\n\n IL-15, IL-12p70, IL-6 constituted a hallmark of critical illness in our study.\n\n A significant inverse association was found between IL-6, IL-8 and PaO2 in critical patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nWhile infection with the nvH1N1 induces a typical innate response in both mild and severe patients, severe disease with respiratory involvement is characterized by early secretion of Th17 and Th1 cytokines usually associated with cell mediated immunity but also commonly linked to the pathogenesis of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases.\n\n The exact role of Th1 and Th17 mediators in the evolution of nvH1N1 mild and severe disease merits further investigation as to the detrimental or beneficial role these cytokines play in severe illness.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2811892","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Jesus

respiratory illness.\n Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions.\n Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak.\n Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species.\n We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor.\n We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.","id":"PMC7095430","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

related antimalarial drugs: a systematic review","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Several quinoline and structurally related antimalarial drugs are associated with cardiovascular side effects, particularly hypotension and electrocardiographic QT interval prolongation.\n\n A prolonged QT interval is a sensitive but not specific risk marker for the development of Torsade de Pointes—a potentially lethal polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia.\n\n The increasing use of quinoline and structurally related antimalarials in mass treatments to eliminate malaria rapidly highlights the need to review their cardiovascular safety profiles.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>The primary objective of this systematic review was to describe the documented clinical and electrocardiographic cardiovascular side effects of quinine, mefloquine, lumefantrine, piperaquine, halofantrine, chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, amodiaquine, and primaquine.\n\n Trials in healthy subjects or patients with Plasmodium falciparum or P.\n\n vivax infection were included if at least two ECGs were conducted during the trial.\n\n All trial designs were included except case reports and pooled analyses.\n\n Secondary outcomes were the methods adopted by trials for measuring and reporting the QT interval.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Data from trials published between 1982 and July 2016 were included.\n\n A total of 177 trials met the inclusion criteria.\n\n 35,448 participants received quinoline antimalarials in these trials, of which 18,436 participants underwent ECG evaluation.\n\n Subjects with co-medication use or comorbidities including cardiovascular disease were excluded from the majority of trials.\n\n Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was the drug most studied (5083 participants).\n\n Despite enormous use over the past 60 years, only 1076, 452, and 150 patients had ECG recordings reported in studies of chloroquine, amodiaquine, and primaquine respectively.\n\n Transiently high concentrations of quinine, quinidine, and chloroquine following parenteral administration have all been associated with hypotension, but there were no documented reports of death or syncope attributable to a cardiovascular cause, nor of electrocardiographic recordings of ventricular arrhythmia in these trials.\n\n The large volume of missing outcome information and the heterogeneity of ECG interval reporting and measurement methodology did not allow pooled quantitative analysis of QT interval changes.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>No serious cardiac adverse effects were recorded in malaria clinical trials of 35,548 participants who received quinoline and structurally related antimalarials with close follow-up including 18,436 individuals who underwent ECG evaluation.\n\n While these findings provide further evidence of the rarity of serious cardiovascular events after treatment with these drugs, they also underscore the need for continued strengthening of pharmacovigilance systems for robust detection of rare drug adverse events in real-world populations.\n\n A standardised approach to measurement and reporting of ECG data in malaria trials is also needed.\n\n\nTrial registration\nid='Par5'>PROSPERO CRD42016036678\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12916-018-1188-2) contains supplementary material,

differences in means and differences in proportions in observational studies","abstract":"In a study comparing the effects of two treatments, the propensity score is the probability of assignment to one treatment conditional on a subject's measured baseline covariates.\n Propensity-score matching is increasingly being used to estimate the effects of exposures using observational data.\n In the most common implementation of propensity-score matching, pairs of treated and untreated subjects are formed whose propensity scores differ by at most a pre-specified amount (the caliper width).\n There has been a little research into the optimal caliper width.\n We conducted an extensive series of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the optimal caliper width for estimating differences in means (for continuous outcomes) and risk differences (for binary outcomes).\n When estimating differences in means or risk differences, we recommend that researchers match on the logit of the propensity score using calipers of width equal to 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score.\n When at least some of the covariates were continuous, then either this value, or one close to it, minimized the mean square error of the resultant estimated treatment effect.\n It also eliminated at least 98% of the bias in the crude estimator, and it resulted in confidence intervals with approximately the correct coverage rates.\n Furthermore, the empirical type I error rate was approximately correct.\n When all of the covariates were binary, then the choice of caliper width had a much smaller impact on the performance of estimation of risk differences and differences in means.\n Copyright © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons,

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

It is a worldwide public health emergency. The outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as pandemic on March 11, 2020. The first confirmed case in Tunisia was reported on March 3, 2020. The detection of this case has led to the implementation of high-level preventive strategies, already planned since February 2020, including physical distancing measures by Tunisian government. The COVID-19 may cause severe viral pneumonia with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) requiring critical care. Information about Tunisian critically ill patients with COVID-19 is scarce. To the best of the authors  knowledge, this is the first report of the clinical features and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Tunisia. The aim of the present study was to describe the demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, imaging findings, management strategies and challenges, and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants: it is a retrospective study carried out in a 9-bed medical intensive care unit (ICU) of Farhat Hached teaching hospital (Sousse, Tunisia) between March 11, 2020 and May 7, 2020. All consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. A confirmed case of COVID-19 is defined by an RT-PCR positive result testing of a specimen collected on a nasopharyngeal swab or endotracheal aspirate sampling in intubated patients. There were no non-inclusion criteria.\nData collection: data were collected by reviewing the medical records. The following patients  demographic and clinical characteristics were collected: age, gender, past medical history, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPSII), timeline between the illness onset to ICU admission, clinical symptoms or signs at presentation, exposure history, laboratory and radiologic results, management strategies (i.e., antiviral therapy, antibiotics, vasopressor, corticosteroid therapy, kidney replacement therapy, ventilatory support, respiratory indices of mechanical ventilation including the ratio of Partial Pressure of Arterial Oxygen and Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (PaO2/FIO2 ratio), Tidal volumes/ Predicted Body Weight (PBW), plateau pressure (Pplat) and Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)), delirium assessed by the Tunisian version of the confusion assessment method (CAM-ICU) and outcomes including length of stay and mortality.\nDefinitions: COVID-19 was diagnosed based on the criteria published by the WHO and confirmed by RT-PCR assay of specimens obtained by nasopharyngeal swab or endotracheal aspirate. SAPSII Score is a severity score and mortality estimation tool and made of 12 physiological variables and 3 disease-related variables. The worst physiological variables are collected within the first 24 hours of ICU admission. CCI is a weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid disease to estimate the risk of death from comorbid conditions. It is used as a measure of comorbidity burden. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition. Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) is the most widely used tool for delirium assessment in ICUs. Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale: It is a scale used to evaluate the level of alertness or agitation of patients under sedatives.\nStatistical analysis: statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to verify the normality of distribution of continuous variables. Descriptive statistics were computed for all study. Categorical data were presented as numbers (%) and continuous ones as mean +- standard deviation or as median (interquartile range 25-75), as appropriate.\nResults\nDemographic and clinical characteristics: during the study period, 10 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections were enrolled, out of 37 patients admitted in the same period for a suspected COVID-19 clinical presentation. Patients  demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 51.8+-6.3years. Eight (80%) were male. Mean SAPS II was 23.2+-1.8. The mean CCI was 2.8+-0.4. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (60%), obesity (20%), chronic kidney disease (20%) and hypertension (10%). The most common initial symptoms were fever, shortness of breath and cough. All the patients were admitted in the ICU for hypoxemic acute respiratory failure. Seven (70%) patients were referred from infectious diseases ward.\nCOVID-19 patients' demographics and characteristics at ICU admission\n	Study population n=10	 	Age (years), Mean+-SD	51.8+-6.3	 	Male, n (%)	8(80)	 	Comorbidities, n(%)		 	Hypertension	1(10)	 	Diabetes	6(60)	 	Obesity	2 (20)	 	Asthma	1(10)	 	Chronic kidney disease	2(20)	 	CCI score, Mean+-SD	2.8+-0.4	 	SAPS II, Mean+-SD	23.2+-1.8	 	History of travel and contacts, n(%)		 	History of travel to country where Covid-19 is endemic	1(10)	 	Known sick contact	2(20)	 	Mean duration of symptoms before ICU admission		 	(days), Mean+-SD	11.3+-1.2	 	Initial Symptoms, n(%)		 	Shortness of breath	9(90)	 	Sore throat	6(60)	 	Cough	8(80)	 	Headache	2(20)	 	Rhinorrhea	6(60)	 	Fever	10(100)	 	Laboratory data on admission		 	White-Cell Count (elt/mm3), Mean+-SD	12535+-366.2	 	Lymphocytopenia, n(%)	8(90)	 	Creatinine &lt;110 micromol/l, n(%)	8(80%)	 	Imaging, n(%)		 	Chest X-Ray	7(70)	 	Chest CT scan	5(50)	 	Chest X-Ray findings, n(%)		 	Clear	0/7(0)	 	Bilateral infiltrates	4/7(40)	 	Pleural effusion	1/7(20)	 	Atelectasis	6/7(50)	 	Chest CT findings, n(%)		 	Bilateral ground-glass opacification	4/5(80)	 	Patchy consolidation	1/5(20)	 	Nodules	1/5(20)	 	Pleural effusions	1/5(20)	 	ARDS, n(%)		 	Mild	2(20)	 	Moderate	4(40)	 	Severe	4(40)	 	PaO2/FIO2 ratio, Mean+-SD	136.2+-79.7	 	\nCCI, Charlson comorbidity index; Countries with endemic Covid-19 disease included China, Iran, Italy, France, Egypt, Turkey, Spain and united states; Obesity is defined by a body mass index &gt;=30kg/m2; CT, Computed tomography; ARDS, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; PaO2/FiO2, arterial partial pressure of oxygen by fraction of inspired oxygen ratio.\nLaboratory and radiologic findings: the first test for COVID-19 was positive in 9 patients out of 10. Only one patient had a negative first test and positive repeat test. Laboratory and radiological findings are summarized in Table 1. Lymphocytopenia occurred in 8(80%) patients. A chest radiograph was done for 7 patients. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was done for five (50%) patients. The common chest CT findings were ground-glass opacities in 4(80%) patients and patchy consolidations in one patient (20%).\nTreatment and outcomes\nVentilatory management: Figure 1 describes patients  ventilatory support during their ICU stay. While the four initial patients were rapidly even immediately intubated, the five secondarily admitted were managed by different non-invasive devices including non-rebreathing mask (NRM), High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) and Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV). This shift in the management was motivated by the worse outcome of the initial invasively managed patients. Figure 2 illustrates gradual improvement of PaO2/FiO2 in case 5 under HFNC doubled by NRM to reduce aerosolization, albeit poor initial PaO2/FiO2. This improvement was significantly increased after a session of prone positioning (6-hour long session) at day 9, while this patient was presenting diffuse alveolar consolidation at his second CT scan performed at ICU admission. Another patient (case 8) managed non-invasively was rather unresponsive to a myriad of ventilatory procedure as NRM, HFNC and NIV. The invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was mandatory at day 10.\nventilatory support, prone positioning and outcomes for COVID-19 patients included in the study\ndaily dynamical changes of PaO2/FiO2, according to respective ventilatory supports in four different profiles initially non-invasively managed, in COVID-19 patients 1, 5, 7 and 8\nAs shown in Table 2, seven (70%) patients required IMV with six of them needing prone positioning (18-hour long sessions). For patients with IMV, ventilatory settings were based on ARDS management strategies. The mean PaO2/FiO2at admission day was 136.2+-79.7. Surprisingly, all severe patients immediately intubated upon arrival, suffered severe but well-tolerated hypoxemia. Daily means PaO2/FiO2were less than 300 and frequently less than 150, consistent with moderate-to-severe ARDS (Figure 3). Figure 3 shows daily dynamical changes in respiratory indices of mechanical ventilation parameters. Tidal volume/ Predicted Body Weight set by the attending physicians ranged between 4.5 and 8ml/kgPBW with a certain variation between and intra-patients. PEEP was set between 0 and 18cm H2O. Plateau pressure was often monitored below 30cm H2O, as recommended by protective ventilation. As a result of these settings, Tidal volume and PEEP were set respectively within the median [IQR] of, 5.7[5.6-6.3]ml/KgPBW and 10.7[6.5-11.7]cm H2O. Plateau pressure was monitored in the median [IQR] of 27.9[25.9-28.5] cm H2O.\ndaily dynamical changes in respiratory indices of mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 included in the study\nCOVID-19 patients' therapeutic characteristics and outcomes\n	Study population; n=10	 	Ventilatory support, n(%)		 	HFNC	3(30)	 	NIV	1(10)	 	IMV	7(70)	 	Prone position, n(%)		 	HFNC	2(20)	 	IMV	5(50)	 	Neuromuscular blockade, n(%)	7(70)	 	Hydroxychloroquine, n(%)	9(90)	 	Lopinavir/Ritonavir, n(%)	4(40)	 	Oseltamivir, n(%)	1(10)	 	Ruxolitinib, n(%)	1(10)	 	Antibiotics, n(%)	10(100)	 	Vasoactive drugs, n(%)	7(70)	 	Delirium, n(%)	5/7 (71.4)	 	Length of stay, (days) Mean+-SD	11.2+-5.8	 	Mortality, n(%)	7(70)	 	\nHFNC, High-Flow Nasal Cannula; NIV, Noninvasive Ventilation; IMV, Invasive Mechanical Ventilation\nPharmacological treatment: six patients received sedatives agents and neuromuscular blockade. Seven (70%) received vasoactive drugs. Two patients received renal replacement therapy, one for an acute renal failure consecutive to acute tubular necrosis (case 10) and one for a chronic renal failure on peritoneal dialysis (case 7). Treatment options of patients are presented in Table 2. Nine patients received hydroxychloroquine among them 5 patients also received antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir or oseltamivir). Antibiotic were used in all patients: 5 patients received cefotaxime and ofloxacin and the others received azithromycin. Only one patient received ruxolitinib. Systemic cortocosteroids was used only in one patient for asthma exacerbation. Curative anticoagulation was introduced in 8 patients. No patient received intravenous immunoglobulin. None of the severe patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the present study. Based on sudden-onset severe hypoxemia, clinical signs, radiological and echocardiographic findings, empirical thrombolysis was done for three hemodynamically unstable patients highly suggesting pulmonary embolism.\nOutcomes\nNeurological impairment: sustained polyuria, important and well-tolerated fever without evidence of infection and large blood pressure variation suggesting vegetative disorders were noticed in four patients. During the ICU stay, 7 patients out of 10 (those having a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale greater than or equal to &quot;-3&quot;) were assessed for delirium. Five patients out of 7 developed respectively hyperactive (n=2), hypoactive (n=2) and mixed delirium (n=1).\nICU course and mortality: the mean ICU length of stay was 11.2+-5.8 days. Of the 10 patients, 7(70%) had died and 3 had been discharged from the ICU. Causes of death were sudden refractory hypoxemia (4/6, 50%), septic shock secondary to a probable ventilator associated pneumonia (case 3) and refractory hypovolemic shock with acute kidney injury and tubular necrosis (case 10). One patient, admitted with a gasping respiration, died within the first hour albeit immediate appropriate management (case 6). Biphasic evolution was noticed in some patients (cases 1, 2 and 3). Sudden refractory hypoxemia occurred often after a significant stabilization period. In the first patient this happened within the weaning process after achieving a P/F near 300 for 7 days.\nDiscussion\nThis study describes 10 critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The main findings of the present retrospective study were: i) Most patients were older male with chronic underlying conditions. ii) All patients were admitted to the ICU because of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and most of them needed endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. Three patients were completely managed with noninvasive mechanical ventilation. iii) The mortality rate was at 70%. The present study had two limitations. First, it was a retrospective study conducted in a single center. Second, the small number of patients, only patients admitted in ICU were included. Thus, future studies with larger sample sizes and prospective study design are needed to better describe the profile and the outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, to the best of authors  knowledge, this is the first report of critically ill patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 in Tunisia. As it was in previous reports, COVID-19 affected older male patients with comorbidities. Similar to previous investigations, patients with underlying medical conditions most commonly diabetes, obesity and chronic kidney disease were at higher risk for severe illnesses. The patients in the present study had similar symptoms to those described in reports from china, Italy and United States. Fever, shortness of breath and cough were present in almost all patients. In line with previous reports, ARDS and refractory hypoxemia were the main reasons for ICU admission. Similar to other previous reports, lymphocytopenia was common.\nIn the present study, 30% of patients were completely managed with noninvasive mechanical ventilation, whereas 70% required endotracheal intubation. The use of IMV in the present study was similar to the report by Arentz et al. (Washington states). However, this rate was lower compared with the data reported by Grasselli et al in an Italian ICU but higher than other reports from Wuhan, China in which the need for endotracheal tube varied from 15% to 47%. This discrepancy in the rates of ventilatory support may be explained by different severity of hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2) and differences in thresholds for ICU admission between studies. Altered gas exchanges was detected in most patients. The mean PaO2/FiO2in this study was 136.2+-79.7. Thus, ventilatory settings were based on ARDS management strategies including low tidal volumes and PEEP titration. The uniformity of hypoxemia in enrolled patients contrasted with a spectrum of different respiratory mechanics attested by patients reported respiratory pressures and responsiveness to prone position. This variability was described by Gattinoni, who proposed different phenotypes of respiratory distress in COVID-19 illness according to radiological findings and respiratory mechanics and suggested different ventilatory management strategies for each phenotype. It is important to notice that the variability in visco-elastic respiratory system properties between patients, was also detected in a same patient during his ICU course.\nRegarding pharmacological treatment, different associations of antimicrobial agents were administered. Four patients received Lopinavir/Ritonavir; one patient received Oseltamivir and the later patient received Ruxolitinib. Those drugs were used empirically without proof of their efficacy. Nine patients out of ten received hydroxychloroquine in the present study. Expert from China and from Italy recommended the use of chloroquine or hydroxyl-chloroquine in COVID-19 patients, given a potential role in clinical success and outcomes improvement. However, more evidence-based data is still required. The heterogeneity in the therapeutic strategy could be explained by daily emerging data on COVID-19 pathophysiology and therapeutic options and by the lack of consensus. In fact, the first therapeutic strategies were extrapolated from existing clinical data derived from other viruses including SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and non-coronaviruses (eg, Ebola virus disease). All patients in the present study initially received antibiotics. It has been suggested that like seasonal influenza, COVID-19 infection may be associated with bacterial coinfection. Only one patient received glucocorticoids for asthma exacerbation. There are conflicting positions regarding corticoids in patients with COVID-19. Further studies are needed to determine the benefit or not of systemic glucocorticoids in those patients.\nCurative anticoagulation was introduced for eight patients in the present study. In fact, some authors reported high D-dimers concentrations and an increased coagulation activity in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and that it is associated with fatal outcome. The biphasic evolution of some patients can be explained by an excessive inflammatory response with cytokine storm causing extensive lung damage and occurring within the first week in invasively ventilated patients in this study (cases 1, 2 and 3). Delirium was observed in 5 out of 7 COVID-19 patients screened by the Tunisian version of the CAM-ICU, while the previous reported incidence in non COVID-19 period, was around 36%. The important increase of delirium rate may be explained by supplemental factors related to the specificity of the SARS-CoV2 itself. A potential direct action, or an indirect one via inflammatory mediators on central nervous system is possible. The important consequent social changes, in addition to typical deliriogenic factors omnipresent in the ICU such as sedatives, prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility may have played a role. In fact, measures of social distancing may be a contributory risk factor for delirium in older adults, who have less or no family visitation and limited mental and spiritual support from caregivers. It is important to notice also that elderly patients, who are at greatest risk to develop severe COVID-19 forms, are also those who usually develop delirium in ICU.\nThe mortality rate in the current study was at 70%. It is in line with previous reports in which the mortality rate varied between 16% and 78%. The main cause of death was refractory hypoxemia. Albeit, ARDS itself could explain severe hypoxemia, pulmonary embolism was also discussed but never confirmed in this study because of the high severity of the presentation impeding transport to perform CT Angiography of the chest. Previous studies have reported a high incidence of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 illness, reaching 30%.\nConclusion\nThe present study is very peculiar by the very severe presentation of the initial patients that exhibited an ARDS like presentation associated with a neurological impairment but surprisingly without acute renal failure. The non-invasive early management achieved better prognosis.\nWhat is known about this topic\nThe Covid-19 was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as pandemic on March 11, 2020;\nData on patient's characteristics, clinical presentation, imaging findings, management strategies, and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are heterogeneous between different studies and countries.\nWhat this study adds\nFinding demonstrated a peculiar profile of COVID-19 in the critically ill as a severe presentation in aged males with comorbidities and poor prognosis;\nMost patients have an ARDS-like presentation and neurological impairment but no acute kidney injury;\nThe only survivals seem to have benefited from noninvasive ventilatory support.\nCite this article: Imen Ben Saida et al.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

cognition.\n Delirium typically manifests as a constellation of symptoms with an acute onset and a fluctuating course.\n Delirium is extremely common in the intensive care unit (ICU) especially amongst mechanically ventilated patients.\n Three subtypes have been recognized: hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed.\n Delirium is frequently undiagnosed unless specific diagnostic instruments are used.\n The CAM-ICU is the most widely studied and validated diagnostic instrument.\n However, the accuracy of this tool may be less than ideal without adequate training of the providers applying it.\n The presence of delirium has important prognostic implications; in mechanically ventilated patients it is associated with a 2.5-fold increase in short-term mortality and a 3.2-fold increase in 6-month mortality.\n Nonpharmacological approaches, such as physical and occupational therapy, decrease the duration of delirium and should be encouraged.\n Pharmacological treatment for delirium traditionally includes haloperidol; however, more data for haloperidol are needed given the paucity of placebo-controlled trials testing its efficacy to treat delirium in the ICU.\n Second-generation antipsychotics have emerged as an alternative for the treatment of delirium, and they may have a better safety profile.\n Dexmedetomidine may prove to be a valuable adjunctive agent for patients with delirium in the ICU.\n","id":"PMC3539890","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer","authors":[{"firstname":"Rodrigo","surname":"Cavallazzi","email":"rcavallazzi@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohamed","surname":"Saad","email":"m0saad01@louisville.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul

deep sedation, time to extubation, delirium and long-term mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a multicentre prospective longitudinal cohort study in 11 Malaysian hospitals including medical/surgical patients (n = 259) who were sedated and ventilated ?24 h.\n\n Patients were followed from ICU admission up to 28 days in ICU with 4-hourly sedation and daily delirium assessments and 180-day mortality.\n\n Deep sedation was defined as Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS) ??3.\nResults\nThe cohort had a mean (SD) age of 53.1 (15.9) years and APACHE II score of 21.3 (8.2) with hospital and 180-day mortality of 82 (31.7 %) and 110/237 (46.4 %).\n\n Patients were followed for 2,657 ICU days and underwent 13,836 RASS assessments.\n\n Midazolam prescription was predominant compared to propofol, given to 241 (93 %) versus 72 (28 %) patients (P &lt; 0.0001) for 966 (39.6 %) versus 183 (7.5 %) study days respectively.\n\n Deep sedation occurred in (182/257) 71 % patients at first assessment and in 159 (61 %) patients and 1,658 (59 %) of all RASS assessments at 48 h.\n\n Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis adjusting for a priori assigned covariates including sedative agents, diagnosis, age, APACHE II score, operative, elective, vasopressors and dialysis showed that early deep sedation was independently associated with longer time to extubation [hazard ratio (HR) 0.93, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.89–0.97, P = 0.003], hospital death (HR 1.11, 95 % CI 1.05–1.18, P &lt; 0.001) and 180-day mortality (HR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.04–1.15, P = 0.002), but not time to delirium (HR 0.98, P = 0.23).\n\n Delirium occurred in 114 (44 %) of patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nIrrespective of sedative choice, early deep sedation was independently associated with delayed extubation and higher mortality, and thus was a potentially modifiable risk in interventional trials.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3625407","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer-Verlag","authors":[{"firstname":"Yahya","surname":"Shehabi","email":"y.shehabi@unsw.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lucy","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Suhaini","surname":"Kadiman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anita","surname":"Alias","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wan

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

application of a rapid IgM?IgG combined antibody test for SARS?CoV?2 infection diagnosis","abstract":"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID?19) quickly spread all over China and to more than 20 other countries.\n Although the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS?Cov?2]) nucleic acid real?time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS?CoV?2 infection, these real?time PCR test kits have many limitations.\n In addition, high false?negative rates were reported.\n There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify a large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients.\n We have developed a rapid and simple point?of?care lateral flow immunoassay that can detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS?CoV?2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages.\n With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses.\n The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID?19 patients and 128 negative patients at eight different clinical sites.\n The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%.\n In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples.\n The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood.\n The IgM?IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test.\n It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS?CoV?2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories.\n","id":"PMC7228300","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

(COVID-19)","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world.\n\n Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.\n\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries.\n\n All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form.\n\n The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU.\n\n We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU.\n\n We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care.\n\n We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility.\n\n Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations.\n\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations.\n\n No recommendation was provided for 6 questions.\n\n The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new recommendations in further releases of these guidelines.\n\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00134-020-06022-5)

be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients.\n\n We evaluate the effect of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads.\n\n\nPatients and methods\nFrench Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting.\n\n Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment.\n\n Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls.\n\n Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point.\n\n\nResults\nSix patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

Therapy for Critically Ill Patients With Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: A Multicenter Observational Study","abstract":"Background\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of ribavirin and recombinant interferon (RBV/rIFN) therapy on the outcomes of critically ill patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), accounting for time-varying confounders.\n\n\nMethods\nThis is a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS from 14 hospitals in Saudi Arabia diagnosed between September 2012 and January 2018. We evaluated the association of RBV/rIFN with 90-day mortality and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA clearance using marginal structural modeling to account for baseline and time-varying confounders.\n\n\nResults\nOf 349 MERS patients, 144 (41.3%) patients received RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-?2a, rIFN-?2b, or rIFN-?1a; none received rIFN-?1b).\n\n RBV/rIFN was initiated at a median of 2 days (Q1, Q3: 1, 3 days) from intensive care unit admission.\n\n Crude 90-day mortality was higher in patients with RBV/rIFN compared to no RBV/rIFN (106/144 [73.6%] vs 126/205 [61.5%]; P = .\n\n02].\n\n After adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders using a marginal structural model, RBV/rIFN was not associated with changes in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .\n\n73–1.44]; P = .\n\n87) or with more rapid MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, .\n\n30–1.44]; P = .\n\n29).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this observational study, RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-?2a, rIFN-?2b, or rIFN-?1a) therapy was commonly used in critically ill MERS patients but was not associated with reduction in 90-day mortality or in faster MERS-CoV RNA clearance.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7108209","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Yaseen

coronavirus (CoV) induced pathology is still largely unclear.\n\n Many SARS patients suffer respiratory distress brought on by interstitial infiltration and frequently show peripheral blood lymphopenia and occasional leucopenia.\n\n One possible cause of this could be interstitial inflammation, following a localized host response.\n\n In this study, we therefore examine the immune response of SARS-CoV in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) over the first 24 hours.\n\n\nMethods\nPBMCs from normal healthy donors were inoculated in vitro with SARS-CoV and the viral replication kinetics was studied by real-time quantitative assays.\n\n SARS-CoV specific gene expression changes were examined by high-density oligonucleotide array analysis.\n\n\nResults\nWe observed that SARS-CoV was capable of infecting and replicating in PBMCs and the kinetics of viral replication was variable among the donors.\n\n SARS-CoV antibody binding assays indicated that SARS specific antibodies inhibited SARS-CoV viral replication.\n\n Array data showed monocyte-macrophage cell activation, coagulation pathway upregulation and cytokine production together with lung trafficking chemokines such as IL8 and IL17, possibly activated through the TLR9 signaling pathway; that mimicked clinical features of the disease.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe identification of human blood mononuclear cells as a direct target of SARS-CoV in the model system described here provides a new insight into disease pathology and a tool for investigating the host response and mechanisms of pathogenesis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC518965","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Lisa

(MERS-CoV) infections pose threats to public health worldwide, making an understanding of MERS pathogenesis and development of effective medical countermeasures (MCMs) urgent.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used homozygous (+/+) and heterozygous (+/?) human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) transgenic mice to study the effect of hDPP4 on MERS-CoV infection.\n\n Specifically, we determined values of 50% lethal dose (LD50) of MERS-CoV for the 2 strains of mice, compared and correlated their levels of soluble (s)hDPP4 expression to susceptibility, and explored recombinant (r)shDPP4 as an effective MCM for MERS infection.\n\n\nResults\nhDPP4+/+ mice were unexpectedly more resistant than hDPP4+/? mice to MERS-CoV infection, as judged by increased LD50, reduced lung viral infection, attenuated morbidity and mortality, and reduced histopathology.\n\n Additionally, the resistance to MERS-CoV infection directly correlated with increased serum shDPP4 and serum virus neutralizing activity.\n\n Finally, administration of rshDPP4 led to reduced lung virus titer and histopathology.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur studies suggest that the serum shDPP4 levels play a role in MERS pathogenesis and demonstrate a potential of rshDPP4 as a treatment option for MERS.\n\n Additionally, it offers a validated pair of Tg mice strains for characterizing the effect of shDPP4 on MERS

Thanks to early flattening of the epidemiological curve, ventilator demand in Greece was kept lower than supply throughout the pandemic, allowing for unbiased comparison of the outcomes of patients undergoing early intubation vs. delayed or no intubation.\nMethods: We conducted an observational study including all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 consecutively admitted in Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece between March 11, 2020 and April 15, 2020. Patients subsequently admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) were categorized into the &quot;early intubation&quot; vs. the &quot;delayed or no intubation&quot; group. The &quot;delayed or no intubation&quot; group included patients receiving non-rebreather mask for equal to or more than 24 h or high-flow nasal oxygen for any period of time or non-invasive mechanical ventilation for any period of time in an attempt to avoid intubation. The remaining intubated patients comprised the &quot;early intubation&quot; group.\nResults: During the study period, a total of 101 patients (37% female, median age 65 years) were admitted in the hospital. Fifty-nine patients (58% of the entire cohort) were exclusively hospitalized in general wards with a mortality of 3% and median length of stay of 7 days. Forty-two patients (19% female, median age 65 years) were admitted in the ICU; all with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Of those admitted in the ICU, 62% had at least one comorbidity and 14% were never intubated. Early intubation was not associated with higher ICU-mortality (21 vs. 33%), fewer ventilator-free days (3 vs. 2 days) or fewer ICU-free days than delayed or no intubation.\nConclusions: A strategy of early intubation was not associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to delayed or no intubation. Given that early intubation may presumably reduce virus aerosolization, these results may justify further research with a randomized controlled trial.\nBackground\nManagement of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often includes mechanical ventilation. Optimal timing of initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation remains unknown. On the one hand, early initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (i.e., early endotracheal intubation) has been advocated to avoid alternate means of oxygenation (such as high-flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive mechanical ventilation) associated with aerosolization of virus. Also, early intubation may prevent induction of harmful self-inflicting lung injury in patients who breath spontaneously and have large transpulmonary pressure swings. On the other hand, skeptics of early intubation may retort that intubation itself may generate viral aerosols, while the concept of self-inflicting lung injury (which could presumably be prevented by early intubation) may not yet be sufficiently supported by solid scientific data. Furthermore, delaying intubation, by trying alternate means of oxygenation, may mean that some patients may not be intubated at all and therefore will be protected from the adverse events of invasive mechanical ventilation. The latter strategy may also address the shortage of ventilators to meet the increased demand of treating patients with COVID-19.\nVentilator supply-demand mismatch could have affected clinical decision-making regarding application of early vs. delayed or no intubation in several epicenters of the pandemic, i.e., the possibility could not be precluded that physicians might be forced not to intubate as part of a triage if ventilators were missing. Accordingly, ventilator supply-demand mismatch could also have affected clinical outcomes and may therefore have acted as a confounder when attempting to estimate the effect of early vs. delayed or no intubation on clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in several epicenters of the pandemic. This might not be the case for Greece where early implementation of social distancing measures and flattening of the epidemiological curve reduced burden of health-care system, constantly maintaining ventilator demand lower than supply. This fact allowed for an unbiased estimation as to whether early intubation as opposed to delayed or no intubation affects prognosis of patients with COVID-19. We hypothesized that early intubation is not associated with worse clinical outcomes, including mortality, than delayed or no intubation among patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nWe conducted an observational cohort study including all adult (&gt;=18 years old) patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, consecutively admitted in Evangelismos Hospital (Athens, Greece) between March 11, 2020 (the day of hospital admission of the first patient with COVID-19) and April 15, 2020. Evangelismos, the biggest tertiary-care hospital in Greece, serves as one of the three reference medical centers for treating patients with COVID-19 in Athens. In response to the pandemic, 72 ICU beds (from the initially available 30), never concomitantly occupied during the study period, were made available for inpatients.\nCompared Groups\nFollowing collection of demographic and clinical data for the complete patient population through review of charts, patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure admitted in the ICU were categorized into the &quot;early intubation&quot; and the &quot;delayed or no intubation&quot; group. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was defined as the requirement for more than 5 L/min nasal oxygen (or Venturi mask more than 40%) to keep a pulse oximeter measured arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) of equal to or more than 95%. &quot;Delayed or no intubation&quot; group consisted of patients receiving non-rebreather mask for equal to or more than 24 h or high-flow nasal oxygen for any period of time or non-invasive mechanical ventilation for any period of time in an attempt to avoid intubation. The remaining intubated patients comprised the &quot;early intubation&quot; group. The decision of early vs. delayed or no intubation rested with the treating clinicians. Clinicians of our department decided intubation in case of hemodynamic instability, altered mentation and respiratory distress (as evidenced by the usage of accessory respiratory muscles or inability to speak). Rather, hypoxemia without respiratory distress or dyspnea (i.e., the silent hypoxemia, which may be commonly seen of patients with COVID-19) was not usually considered enough to trigger intubation in accordance to relevant reports highlighting both the confounders affecting the quantification of hypoxemia and its association with the physiologic state of patients with COVID-19.\nStudy Outcomes\nICU-mortality, ventilator-free days and ICU-free days were the outcomes of the study. ICU-mortality was censored at 28 days after the occurrence of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Ventilator-free days were calculated starting at the first 24 continuous hours without invasive mechanical ventilation. The day of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure occurrence was considered as day 0 of the 28-day period for which ventilator-free days were calculated. Periods of extubation lasting for equal to or &lt;48 h before re-intubation were not calculated in the sum of ventilator-free days. ICU-free days were calculated starting at the first 24 continuous hours outside the ICU in the post-ICU discharge period. The day of ICU admission was considered as day 0 of the 28-day period for which ICU-free days were calculated. Occurrence of septic shock (defined according to Sepsis-3) and need of continuous renal replacement therapy also served as secondary outcomes of the study.\nStatistical Analysis\nStudy population included all patients treated during the study period. Continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Mann-Whitney rank sum-test was used to compare continuous variables. Categorical variables are presented as number of patients (percentage). X2 or Fisher exact-test was used to compare categorical variables. A binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to isolate the contribution of early intubation and sex (independent variables) to mortality (categorical dependent variable). All statistical tests were 2-tailed and statistical significance was defined as p &lt; 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software ver. 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).\nResults\nDuring the study period, a total of 101 patients [37% female, median age 65 (IQR 53-73) years] were admitted in the hospital (Figure 1). Fifty-nine patients (58% of the entire cohort) were exclusively hospitalized in general wards. Their mortality rate was 3% (only two patients, who opted out ICU admission, died) and median length of stay was 7 days (IQR 5-13). None of the healthcare-workers of the hospital tested positive for COVID-19.\nPatient flow diagram. Six patients admitted in the intensive care unit were not intubated and therefore were included in the delayed or no intubation group. Four patients (transferred intubated from another hospital) were not categorized into the early vs. delayed or no intubation group due to unavailability of relevant data.\nTable 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics and outcomes of 42 patients admitted in the ICU (all with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure) during the study period. The median time from hospital to ICU admission was 0 (IQR 0-3) days. Of those admitted in the ICU, 19% were female and 62% had at least one comorbidity. Their median age was 65 (IQR 58-71) years. None of those had a do-not-intubate order and 36 (86%) patients were indeed intubated. ICU-mortality among patients admitted in the ICU was 26%. Data for 13 of those patients have been included in a previous report focusing on the application of positive end-expiratory pressure.\nBaseline characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted in the intensive care unit.\n	All (n = 42)	Early intubation (n = 14)	Delayed or no intubation (n = 24)	p-value	 	Age, years (IQR)	65 (58-71)	63 (57-69)	64 (57-74)	0.68	 	Sex, female, n (%)	8 (19)	6 (43)	2 (8)	0.03	 	Race, n (%)				0.69	 	Caucasian	39 (93)	14 (100)	21 (85)		 	Asian	2 (5)	0 (0)	2 (8)		 	Middle Eastern	1 (2)	0 (0)	1 (4)		 	Comorbidity, n (%)	26 (62)	8 (57)	15 (63)	0.74	 	Cardiovascular	20 (48)	7 (50)	11 (46)	0.80	 	Diabetes Mellitus	7 (17)	2 (14)	5 (21)	1	 	Chronic lung disease	4 (10)	1 (7)	3 (13)	1	 	Renal failure	1 (2)	0 (0)	1 (4)	1	 	Malignancy	5 (12)	0 (0)	4 (17)	0.27	 	SOFA score (IQR)	4 (4-6)	4 (4-5)	4 (4-6)	0.8	 	Respiratory	4 (3-4)	4 (4-4)	4 (3-4)	0.11	 	Coagulation	0 (0-0)	0 (0-0)	0 (0-1)	0.16	 	Hepatic	0 (0-0)	0 (0-0)	0 (0-0)	0.3	 	Neurologic	0 (0-0)	0 (0-0)	0 (0-0)	0.97	 	Cardiovascular	0 (0-0)	0 (0-0)	0 (0-0)	0.2	 	Renal	0 (0-0)	0 (0-0)	0 (0-0)	0.77	 	Usage of non-rebreather mask, n (%)	41 (98)	14 (100)	23 (96)	1	 	Usage of high-flow nasal oxygen, n (%)	11 (26)	0 (0)	11 (46)	0.003	 	Usage of non-invasive mechanical ventilation, n (%)	2 (5)	0 (0)	2 (8)	0.52	 	Lung mechanics at day of intubation, (IQR)					 	Ppeak	NA	39 (36-41)	37 (32-42)	0.6	 	Pplateau	NA	28 (28-31)	28 (25-32)	0.45	 	PEEPtotal	NA	17 (13-19)	14 (11-19)	0.2	 	Pdriving	NA	13 (10-15)	13 (12-17)	0.27	 	Transferred intubated from another hospital, n (%)	19 (45)	12 (86)	3 (13)	&lt;0.001	 	Outcomes within 28 days	 	Intubation, n (%)	36 (86)	14 (100)	18 (75)	0.06	 	Intubation outside ICU, n (%)	21 (50)	12 (86)	6 (25)	0.004	 	Septic shock, n (%)	18 (43)	6 (43)	11 (46)	1	 	Continuous renal replacement therapy, n (%)	17 (41)	4 (29)	12 (50)	0.19	 	Ventilator-free days, days (IQR)	NA	3 (0-17)	2 (1-13)	0.57	 	ICU-free days, days (IQR)	0 (0-15)	0 (0-16)	0 (0-12)	0.59	 	Time from acute respiratory failure to ICU admission, days (IQR)	1 (0-1)	1 (0-1)	1 (0-2)	0.87	 	ICU-mortality, n (%)	11 (26)	3 (21)	8 (33)	0.48	 	\nIQR, interquartile range; SOFA, sequential organ failure assessment; NA, not applicable; ICU, intensive care unit.\n&quot;Delayed or no intubation&quot; group consisted of patients receiving non-rebreather mask for equal to or more than 24 h or high-flow nasal oxygen for any period of time or non-invasive mechanical ventilation for any period of time in an attempt to avoid intubation. The remaining intubated patients comprised the &quot;early intubation&quot; group.\nSix patients admitted in the ICU were not intubated and therefore were included in the delayed or no intubation group. Four patients (transferred intubated from another hospital) were not categorized into the early vs. delayed or no intubation group due to unavailability of relevant data.\nCardiovascular comorbidities included congestive heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia and valvular dysfunction.\nTable 1 also summarizes the baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing early vs. delayed or no intubation. Four patients (all transferred intubated from another hospital) were not categorized into the early vs. delayed or no intubation group due to unavailability of relevant data. Baseline characteristics [including age, comorbidities and organ failure, as assessed by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, on the day of occurrence of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure] were comparable between the two groups with the exemption of sex. Regarding means of oxygenation, non-rebreather mask was used by all but one patient (who belonged in the delayed or no intubation group), while high-flow nasal oxygen and non-invasive mechanical ventilation was used by 11 and two patients, respectively. Regarding outcomes, early intubation was not associated with higher ICU-mortality, (21 vs. 33%), fewer ventilator-free days (3 vs. 2 days) or fewer ICU-free days (0 vs. 0 days) than delayed or no intubation. Early intubation was associated with lower (albeit statistically non-significant) need for continuous renal replacement therapy (29 vs. 50%) than delayed or no intubation. The above findings persisted when comparing the baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing early vs. delayed intubation, i.e., after exclusion of six ICU patients who were not intubated (Supplementary Table). Time from acute respiratory failure to intubation was shorter for the early intubation compared to the delayed intubation group (0 vs. 2 days) (Supplementary Table).\nEarly intubation (as opposed to delayed or no intubation) was not associated with mortality even after adjustment for sex (i.e., a baseline characteristic which differed between the two groups).\nDiscussion\nWe found that approximately one-fourth of patients admitted in the ICU with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in Athens, Greece died during their ICU stay. We also found that early intubation was not associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as mortality, ICU-free days and ventilator-free days, compared to delayed or no intubation among those patients.\nThe observed mortality rate of 26% for patients with COVID-19 admitted in our ICU seems lower than the mortality rates of 62 and 51% reported by early studies from Wuhan, China and Washington State, USA, respectively. Although the latter mortality rates might be exaggerated and subsequent studies reported outcomes similar to ours, this finding is intriguing. It could be explained by the fact that the health-care system of Greece was not substantially burdened throughout the course of the COVID-19 outbreak. Indeed, a substantially burdened health-care system might lead to worse outcomes. Thus, our finding regarding mortality rate may highlight the beneficial effect of protecting health-care care systems (e.g., through early flattening of the epidemiological curve) from overwhelming on outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19.\nWe found that a strategy of early intubation, as opposed to delayed or no intubation, was not associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as mortality, ventilator-free days and ICU-free days. Rather, it seems that the difference in terms of mortality (early: 21% vs. delayed or no: 33%) and ventilator-free days (early: 3 vs. delayed or no: 2 days) was in favor of the early than the delayed or no intubation strategy. Especially, the observed 12% absolute reduction in mortality with early intubation (which did not reach statistical significance, presumably due to small sample size) may indeed be clinically significant. This finding does not seem to justify the hesitance of clinicians to perform early intubation in concern that it may inadvertently lead to otherwise preventable intubations. In the light of our finding that an early intubation strategy might not be associated with increased mortality and morbidity, one could advocate this approach when taking into consideration its potential benefit of reduced viral aerosolization. To this end, early intubation and avoidance of prolonged use of high-flow nasal oxygen and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (although a short trial should not be precluded) has been advised by various societies' guidelines to prevent risks for patients and healthcare workers.\nIn addition to its usage as an infection control measure, early intubation could also serve as a means to prevent both emergent intubation and patient self-inflicting lung injury. Regarding emergent intubation, its avoidance could improve outcomes, including mortality, by reducing incidence of hypoxemia. Regarding patient self-inflicting lung injury, its prevention and the subsequent pulmonary-renal crosstalk (with or without the effect of intrathoracic pressures and positive end-expiratory pressure) might explain our finding that need for continuous renal replacement therapy was lower (albeit statistically non-significant) in the early vs. the delayed or no intubation group (29 vs. 50%). The latter finding could also be explained by the relative dehydration of patients struggling to maintain normoxemia and avoid intubation through the prolonged usage of non-rebreather mask or high-flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive mechanical ventilation.\nOur study has limitations. Firstly, although we included all consecutive patients admitted in our hospital, our retrospective single-center study still has a moderate sample size. However, this is the case for several other studies involving critically ill patients with COVID-19. Also, the moderate sample size is the fortunate outcome of the early flattening of the epidemiological curve in Greece and eventually the reason we were able to estimate the effect of early vs. delayed or no intubation on outcomes of patients with COVID-19 without the major confounding factor of the shortage of ventilators. Secondly, similar to the vast majority of studies in the field of COVID-19, our study is observational and therefore subject to confounding. Even though there was no difference at baseline between the compared groups in terms of variables known to affect prognosis of patients with COVID-19, such as age, comorbidities and severity of illness (as assessed by SOFA), we cannot preclude potential residual confounding, which could only be eliminated if the study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. Besides, our main finding persisted even after adjusting for sex. Thirdly, although we presented data on pulmonary and circulatory SOFA at baseline (Table 1), we did not collect specific data on respiratory rate and heart rate, which could further inform readers regarding the decision for intubation. Finally, one could argue that the comparison of early vs. delayed intubation (i.e., after exclusion of ICU patients who were not intubated) should be the primary analysis of our report. To that end, we presented the aforementioned analysis in the Supplementary Table and found similar results as in our main analysis. Moreover, the fact that an early intubation strategy was not associated with worse outcomes even when the comparator included never intubated patients may further strengthens the findings of our study.\nConclusions\nThe findings of our study suggest that early intubation, as opposed to delayed or no intubation, may not be associated with worse outcomes among critically ill patients with COVID-19. Given the observed lack of a negative effect of early intubation on mortality and morbidity of critically ill patients, such a therapeutic approach could be considered to avoid viral cross-contamination and to prevent self-inflicting lung injury. Thus, our study may justify further research with a prospective, randomized controlled trial.\nData Availability Statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nEthics Statement\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by The Institutional Review Board of Evangelismos approved of this study (#212, 2020) and waived the need for informed patient consent.

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are unknown.\n\n\nObjectives\nThe purpose of this study was to describe the degree of myocardial injury and associated outcomes in a large hospitalized cohort with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to 1 of 5 Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York City between February 27, 2020, and April 12, 2020, with troponin-I (normal value &lt;0.03 ng/ml) measured within 24 h of admission were included (n = 2,736).\n\n Demographics, medical histories, admission laboratory results, and outcomes were captured from the hospitals’ electronic health records.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age was 66.4 years, with 59.6% men.\n\n Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary artery disease, atrial

diffuse alveolar damage with severe capillary congestion and variegated findings in lungs and other organs suggesting vascular dysfunction","abstract":"Aims\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2), has rapidly evolved into a sweeping pandemic.\n\n Its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, and the general extent of organ involvement and the microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised.\n\n Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID?19?associated organ alterations.\n\n\nMethods and results\nThis article reports the autopsy findings of 21 COVID?19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland.\n\n An in?corpore technique was performed to ensure optimal staff safety.\n\n The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage and massive capillary congestion, often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation.\n\n Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia.\n\n Further findings included pulmonary embolism (n = 4), alveolar haemorrhage (n = 3), and vasculitis (n = 1).\n\n Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised and five of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\n Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy.\n\n Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus).\n\n Additionally, there was an overall predominance of males and individuals with blood group A (81% and 65%, respectively).\n\n All relevant histological slides are linked as open?source scans in supplementary files.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study provides an overview of postmortem findings in COVID?19 cases, implying that hypertensive, elderly, obese, male individuals with severe cardiovascular comorbidities as well as those with blood group A may have a lower threshold of tolerance for COVID?19. This provides a pathophysiological explanation for higher mortality rates among these patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7496150","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cmi.2020.07.049","date":"2020-07-16","title":"Clinical characteristics, management and in-hospital mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Genoa, Italy","abstract":"Objectives\nTo describe clinical characteristics, management and outcome of individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19);

health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region.\n\n\nMethods\nAfter identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility.\n\n Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented.\n\n Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively.\n\n The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101).\n\n As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King

analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK

bronchovascular sheath) on baseline CT imaging is an accurate predictor for subsequent pneumomediastinum (PMD)/pneumothorax (PNX) development in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nThis is an observational, case-control study.\n\n From a prospectively acquired database, all consecutive invasively ventilated COVID-19 ARDS patients who underwent at least one baseline chest CT scan during the study time period (February 25th, 2020–December 31st, 2020) were identified; those who had tracheal lesion or already had PMD/PNX at the time of the first available chest imaging were excluded.\n\n\nResults\n37/173 (21.4%) patients enrolled had PMD/PNX; specifically, 20 (11.5%) had PMD, 10 (5.8%) PNX, 7 (4%) both.\n\n 33/37 patients with subsequent PMD/PNX had Macklin effect on baseline CT (89.2%, true positives) 8.5 days [range, 1–18] before the first actual radiological evidence of PMD/PNX.\n\n Conversely, 6/136 patients without PMD/PNX (4.4%, false positives) demonstrated Macklin effect (p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Macklin effect yielded a sensitivity of 89.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 74.6–96.9), a specificity of 95.6% (95% CI: 90.6–98.4), a positive predictive value (PV) of 84.5% (95% CI: 71.3–92.3), a negative PV of 97.1% (95% CI: 74.6–96.9) and an accuracy of 94.2% (95% CI: 89.6–97.2) in predicting PMD/PNX (AUC:0.924).\n\n\nConclusions\nMacklin effect accurately predicts, 8.5 days in advance, PMD/PNX development in COVID-19 ARDS

ventilatory support is unclear in COVID-19 patients.\n\n The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the different respiratory support strategies on barotrauma occurrence; we also sought to determine the frequency of barotrauma and the clinical characteristics of the patients who experienced this complication.\n\n\nMethods\nThis multicentre retrospective case-control study from 1 March 2020 to 28 February 2021 included COVID-19 patients who experienced barotrauma during hospital stay.\n\n They were matched with controls in a 1:1 ratio for the same admission period in the same ward of treatment.\n\n Univariable and multivariable logistic regression (OR) were performed to explore which factors were associated with barotrauma and in-hospital death.\n\n\nResults\nWe included 200 cases and 200 controls.\n\n Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 39.3% of patients in the barotrauma group, and in 20.1% of controls (p&lt;0.001).\n\n Receiving non-invasive ventilation (C-PAP/PSV) instead of conventional oxygen therapy (COT) increased the risk of barotrauma (OR 5.04, 95% CI 2.30 - 11.08, p&lt;0.001), similarly for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 6.24, 95% CI 2.86-13.60, p&lt;0.001).\n\n High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO), compared with COT, did not significantly increase the risk of barotrauma.\n\n Barotrauma frequency occurred in 1.00% [95% CI 0.88-1.16] of patients; these were older (p=0.022) and more frequently immunosuppressed (p=0.013).\n\n Barotrauma was shown to be an independent risk for death (OR 5.32, 95% CI 2.82-10.03, p&lt;0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nC-PAP/PSV compared with COT or HFNO increased the risk of barotrauma; otherwise HFNO did not.\n\n Barotrauma was recorded in 1.00% of patients, affecting mainly patients with more severe COVID-19 disease.\n\n Barotrauma was independently associated with mortality.\n\n\nTrial registration\nthis case-control study was prospectively registered in clinicaltrial.\n\ngov as

Silent Hypoxemia Is Baffling to Physicians","abstract":"Patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are described as exhibiting oxygen levels incompatible with life without dyspnea.\n The pairing—dubbed happy hypoxia but more precisely termed silent hypoxemia—is especially bewildering to physicians and is considered as defying basic biology.\n This combination has attracted extensive coverage in media but has not been discussed in medical journals.\n It is possible that coronavirus has an idiosyncratic action on receptors involved in chemosensitivity to oxygen, but well-established pathophysiological mechanisms can account for most, if not all, cases of silent hypoxemia.\n These mechanisms include the way dyspnea and the respiratory centers respond to low levels of oxygen, the way the prevailing carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) blunts the brain’s response to hypoxia, effects of disease and age on control of breathing, inaccuracy of pulse oximetry at low oxygen saturations, and temperature-induced shifts in the oxygen dissociation curve.\n Without knowledge of these mechanisms, physicians caring for patients with hypoxemia free of dyspnea are operating in the dark, placing vulnerable patients with COVID-19 at considerable risk.\n In conclusion, features of COVID-19 that physicians find baffling become less strange when viewed in light of long-established principles of respiratory physiology; an understanding of these mechanisms will enhance patient care if the much-anticipated second wave emerges.\n","id":"PMC7397783","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Thoracic Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Martin

patients with suspicion of sepsis outside the intensive care unit","abstract":"Background\nThe Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) Task Force recently introduced a new clinical score termed quick Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) for identification of patients at risk of sepsis outside the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n We attempted to compare the discriminatory capacity of the qSOFA versus the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) score for predicting mortality, ICU-free days, and organ dysfunction-free days in patients with suspicion of infection outside the ICU.\n\n\nMethods\nThe Weill Cornell Medicine Registry and Biobank of Critically Ill Patients is an ongoing cohort of critically ill patients, for whom biological samples and clinical information (including vital signs before and during ICU hospitalization) are prospectively collected.\n\n Using such information, qSOFA and SIRS scores outside the ICU (specifically, within 8 hours before ICU admission) were calculated.\n\n This study population was therefore comprised of patients in the emergency department or the hospital wards who had suspected infection, were subsequently admitted to the medical ICU and were included in the Registry and Biobank.\n\n\nResults\nOne hundred fifty-two patients (67% from the emergency department) were included in this study.\n\n Sixty-seven percent had positive cultures and 19% died in the hospital.\n\n Discrimination of in-hospital mortality using qSOFA [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.74; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.66–0.81] was significantly greater compared with SIRS criteria (AUC, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.51–0.67; p?=?0.03).\n\n The qSOFA performed better than SIRS regarding discrimination for ICU-free days (p?=?0.04), but not for ventilator-free days (p?=?0.19), any organ dysfunction-free days (p?=?0.13), or renal dysfunction-free days (p?=?0.17).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn patients with suspected infection who eventually required admission to the ICU, qSOFA calculated before their ICU admission had greater accuracy than SIRS for predicting mortality and ICU-free days.\n\n However, it may be less clear whether qSOFA is also better than SIRS criteria for predicting ventilator free-days and organ dysfunction-free days.\n\n These findings may help clinicians gain further insight into the usefulness of qSOFA.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-017-1658-5) contains

non-randomised, routinely collected data—specifically the REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely collected health Data (RECORD) and the Strengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statements—do not capture the complexity of pharmacoepidemiological research.\n We have therefore extended the RECORD statement to include reporting guidelines specific to pharmacoepidemiological research (RECORD-PE).\n This article includes the RECORD-PE checklist (also available on www.\nrecord-statement.\norg) and explains each checklist item with examples of good reporting.\n We anticipate that increasing use of the RECORD-PE guidelines by researchers and endorsement and adherence by journal editors will improve the standards of reporting of pharmacoepidemiological research undertaken using routinely collected data.\n This improved transparency will benefit the research community, patient care, and ultimately improve public

of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates.\n Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates.\n Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects.\n However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment.\n We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups.\n We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample.\n The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher?order moments, and interactions.\n The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample.\n Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study.\n We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute

is equal to the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment that was actually received.\n These weights are then incorporated into the analyses to minimize the effects of observed confounding.\n Previous research has found that these methods result in unbiased estimation when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes.\n However, conventional methods of variance estimation were shown to result in biased estimates of standard error.\n In this study, we conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations to examine different methods of variance estimation when using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the effect of treatment.\n We considered three variance estimation methods: (i) a naïve model?based variance estimator; (ii) a robust sandwich?type variance estimator; and (iii) a bootstrap variance estimator.\n We considered estimation of both the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in the treated.\n We found that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates.\n The other estimators resulted in biased estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with incorrect coverage rates.\n Our simulations were informed by a case study examining the effect of statin prescribing on mortality.\n © 2016

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region.\n\n\nMethods\nAfter identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility.\n\n Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented.\n\n Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively.\n\n The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101).\n\n As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of

socioeconomic repercussions have fueled calls to lift these measures.\n In the absence of population-wide restrictions, isolation of infected individuals is key to curtailing transmission.\n However, the effectiveness of symptom-based isolation in preventing a resurgence depends on the extent of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission.\n We evaluate the contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission based on recent individual-level data regarding infectiousness prior to symptom onset and the asymptomatic proportion among all infections.\n We found that the majority of incidences may be attributable to silent transmission from a combination of the presymptomatic stage and asymptomatic infections.\n Consequently, even if all symptomatic cases are isolated, a vast outbreak may nonetheless unfold.\n We further quantified the effect of isolating silent infections in addition to symptomatic cases, finding that over one-third of silent infections must be isolated to suppress a future outbreak below 1% of the population.\n Our results indicate that symptom-based isolation must be supplemented by rapid contact tracing and testing that identifies asymptomatic and

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days

Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS?CoV?2?induced respiratory

In Germany, the peak incidence of more than seven cases per 100 000 population per day was reached in March 31-April 3, 2020, after lockdown measures were introduced on March 21. As of July 15, 2020, 199 700 patients in Germany had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The number of COVID-19-related deaths is 10 9 per 100 000 population, which is low compared with other health-care systems that have, at least in part, been overburdened.\nFirst reports from China indicated mild symptoms in 80% of all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection; approximately 20% had to be admitted to hospital, of whom 25% needed to be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the impact on the total population of patients with COVID-19 could vary considerably, as register data suggest. The cumulative proportion of patients who were hospitalised was 26% in Belgium, 30% in the Netherlands, 53% in Spain, and 69% in France, whereas Germany reported 17% by July 2, 2020. \nResearch in context\n Evidence before this study \nThe proportion of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation, internsive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation differs widely between countries affected by the pandemic. The in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 is not well known because most studies report incomplete data, with a large group of patients still hospitalised or in the ICU. We searched PubMed on April 22, 2020, for articles using the search terms &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; OR &quot;COVID-19&quot; AND &quot;critical care&quot; OR &quot;intensive care&quot; OR &quot;ICU&quot; AND &quot;mortality&quot;. We included articles for which at least the abstract was available in English. Our search identified 44 studies that included original clinical outcome data from patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. We found no studies of large cohorts that reported only discharged patients.\n Added value of this study \nTo our knowledge, this is the first large case series describing characteristics, resource use, and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 in an unselected and unbiased cohort of already discharged patients within a health-care system without major resource limitations. The study cohort included 10 021 patients, 1727 of whom were mechanically ventilated, in 920 hospitals across Germany, representing all treatment levels.\n Implications of all the available evidence \nIn the German health-care system, in which capacities were not overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality was high for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, reaching almost 75% in patients aged 80 years or older or in those requiring dialysis, but was considerably lower for patients younger than 60 years. From a European perspective, the study shows that the overall in-hospital mortality is similar to that in other countries, such as France. However, the age distribution of patients on mechanical ventilation differs between countries. The use of mechanical ventilation was comparatively high in Germany, particularly among older people.\nIn-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 varies widely between regions, ranging from 20% to more than 50%. Because the duration of mechanical ventilation and recovery from COVID-19 often takes several weeks, recent publications include a substantial subset of patients who are still in the ICU, and little is known about outcomes of a nationwide cohort of patients discharged from hospital. \nFurthermore, differences in outcomes could be attributed to availability and access to health-care system resources. The number of ICU beds varies greatly in different health-care systems, with pre-COVID-19 levels within Europe ranging from 5 0 per 100 000 population in Ireland to 33 9 per 100 000 population in Germany, with intermediate capacities in countries such as the Netherlands (6 7), Spain (9 7), England (10 5), France (16 3), and Belgium (16 6).17 In the current pandemic, the availability of ICU beds might affect the long-term outcome for patients with COVID-19. To date, Germany has always had enough free ICU beds, as reported by the national registry.\nThe aim of this study was to identify detailed baseline characteristics and outcomes of a large, unselected, and unbiased cohort of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with completed hospital treatments in one of the least resource-limited health-care systems, particularly focusing on patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\nMethods\nStudy design\nFor this observational study, we used anonymised nationwide administrative claims data from the German Local Health Care Funds (Allgemeine Ortskrankenkassen [AOK]), the largest sickness fund group within Germany's statutory health insurance system. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Witten/Herdecke University (research ethics board number 92/2020; May, 2020).\nParticipants and data collection\nAOK provides statutory health insurance for around 32% of the German population. Membership is open to anyone regardless of factors such as professional affiliation, income, age, or comorbidities. Of note, almost every inhabitant of Germany has obligatory health-care insurance. According to the German accounting method for the health-care system, all diagnoses, outcomes, and procedures must be reported to the sickness funds, as required by law. Hence, the data set includes detailed information on patient characteristics, such as age, sex, length of hospital stay, diagnoses and procedure codes, and discharge type (survival status). Diagnoses were coded according to the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases and procedures were coded according to the International Classification of Procedures in Medicine, the Operationen- und Prozedurenschlussel (2020 version).\nFor the analyses, we included only patients with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR (diagnosis code U07.1) who were at least 18 years old at admission and were admitted to hospital between Feb 26, 2020, and April 19, 2020, inclusive. We included only patients for whom the complete hospital course was available (ie, patients were discharged or died in hospital during the study period). Based on experiences from the first weeks of the pandemic, the total number of patients could increase by up to 2% because of subsequent completion of claims after patient discharge. For billing purposes, COVID-19 cannot be coded as a main diagnosis, which is defined as the main reason for hospitalisation. Hence, we could not distinguish between patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 or for any other reason. Furthermore, because one insured person might have had several hospital stays during the observation period due to a transfer from one hospital to another, we grouped patients with adjacent completed hospital stays into one case.\nProcedures\nPatients were grouped according to whether or not they received any form of mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation was defined as ventilation for more than 1 h. Patients who received mechanical ventilation for more than 6 h were grouped into three subgroups: patients with only non-invasive mechanical ventilation; patients with only invasive mechanical ventilation; and patients with non-invasive mechanical ventilation failure. If non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation occurred during the same day, patients were assigned to the invasive mechanical ventilation group, because non-invasive ventilation is often used for a short period to bridge patients to intubation. If non-invasive ventilation was coded at least 1 day before invasive ventilation, patients were assigned to the non-invasive mechanical ventilation failure group. We did not include patients with more than 6 h of ventilation for whom a procedure code for invasive or non-invasive ventilation was missing (n=58). Patients who were ventilated for 1-6 h were reported as a single group, regardless of the type of ventilation. Continuous positive airway pressure is not encoded in the German diagnosis-related group system in conjunction with ICU medicine (it is encoded only in sleep medicine), so it was not available for analysis. Moreover, in contrast to non-invasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow oxygen therapy is not reimbursed; therefore, the data quality is low, and patients could not be separately analysed. To account for comorbidities, we used the Charlson comorbidity index and Elixhauser comorbidities. \nStatistical analysis\nFor continuous variables, we report means with SDs and medians with IQRs. For categorical variables, we report absolute numbers and percentages. All variables are reported for patients with and without mechanical ventilation and for the different ventilation groups. Additionally, we show descriptive statistics for patients with and without ventilation by age group (18-59 years, 60-69 years, 70-79 years, and &gt;=80 years) and sex. All analyses were done using Oracle Database (version 12c) and R (version 3.5.3).\nRole of the funding source\nThere was no funding source for this study. All authors had full access to all the data in the study and had responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\nResults\nThe study cohort included 10 021 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis who were admitted as inpatients to 920 German hospitals between Feb 26, 2020, and April 19, 2020, and who had a closed hospital course. 563 (61%) hospitals treated patients with mechanical ventilation. 95 2% of AOK-insured patients with coded COVID-19 infection at admission were included in the analysis; 4 8% could not be reported because they were still in hospital (1 0%) or their claims were not yet completed (3 8%).\nPatient characteristics by type of ventilation\n		All patients	Patients without ventilation	Patients with ventilation	 					All types of ventilation	Non-invasive ventilation only	Invasive ventilation only	Non-invasive ventilation failure	Ventilation for 1-6 h	 	Number of patients	10 021	8294	1727	145	1318	141	65	 	Number of hospitals	920	894	563	107	492	93	59	 	Age, years	 		Mean (SD)	68 3 (17 3)	68 3 (18 0)	68 4 (13 1)	72 4 (12 2)	67 9 (13 1)	67 6 (12 9)	74 0 (14 1)	 		Median (IQR)	72 0 (57 0-82 0)	73 0 (56 0-83 0)	71 0 (60 0-79 0)	75 0 (64 0-82 0)	70 0 (59 0-78 0)	70 0 (59 0-78 0)	77 0 (67 0-84 0)	 	Age group, years	 		18-59	2896 (28 9%)	2474 (29 8%)	422 (24 4%)	22 (15 2%)	337 (25 6%)	37 (26 2%)	9 (13 8%)	 		60-69	1621 (16 2%)	1239 (14 9%)	382 (22 1%)	23 (15 9%)	305 (23 1%)	32 (22 7%)	9 (13 8%)	 		70-79	2158 (21 5%)	1623 (19 6%)	535 (31 0%)	45 (31 0%)	413 (31 3%)	45 (31 9%)	20 (30 8%)	 		&gt;=80	3346 (33 4%)	2958 (35 7%)	388 (22 5%)	55 (37 9%)	263 (20 0%)	27 (19 1%)	27 (41 5%)	 	Sex	 		Female	4822 (48 1%)	4242 (51 1%)	580 (33 6%)	56 (38 6%)	442 (33 5%)	42 (29 8%)	25 (38 5%)	 		Male	5199 (51 9%)	4052 (48 9%)	1147 (66 4%)	89 (61 4%)	876 (66 5%)	99 (70 2%)	40 (61 5%)	 	Elixhauser comorbidities	 		Hypertension	5575 (55 6%)	4498 (54 2%)	1077 (62 4%)	97 (66 9%)	816 (61 9%)	91 (64 5%)	37 (56 9%)	 		Diabetes	2791 (27 9%)	2120 (25 6%)	671 (38 9%)	56 (38 6%)	520 (39 5%)	60 (42 6%)	15 (23 1%)	 		Cardiac arrhythmia	2699 (26 9%)	1960 (23 6%)	739 (42 8%)	55 (37 9%)	574 (43 6%)	64 (45 4%)	24 (36 9%)	 		Renal failure	2287 (22 8%)	1870 (22 5%)	417 (24 1%)	45 (31 0%)	306 (23 2%)	28 (19 9%)	21 (32 3%)	 		Congestive heart failure	1963 (19 6%)	1436 (17 3%)	527 (30 5%)	58 (40 0%)	385 (29 2%)	45 (31 9%)	21 (32 3%)	 		Chronic pulmonary disease	1358 (13 6%)	1025 (12 4%)	333 (19 3%)	43 (29 7%)	234 (17 8%)	29 (20 6%)	13 (20 0%)	 		Obesity	590 (5 9%)	361 (4 4%)	229 (13 3%)	17 (11 7%)	182 (13 8%)	23 (16 3%)	..

BMI=body-mass index.\nBaseline characteristics are presented in Table 1, Table 2 and in the appendix (p 4). 8294 (83%) patients were treated without ventilation and 1727 (17%) were treated with ventilation, of whom 145 received non-invasive ventilation only, 1318 received invasive mechanical ventilation only, and 141 had non-invasive ventilation failure.\nAge distribution (A) and Charlson comorbidity index (B)\nOnly adult patients aged 18 years or older were included in the analysis.\nThe median age was 72 years (IQR 57-82), with a similar median age for patients with and without ventilation (table 1). The proportion of patients who were ventilated was 15% (422 of 2896) of those aged 18-59 years, 24% (382 of 1621) of those aged 60-69 years, 25% (535 of 2158) of those aged 70-79 years, and 12% (388 of 3346) of those aged 80 years and older (figure 1A ).\nThe proportion of men was 49% (4052 of 8294) among patients who did not receive ventilation and 66% (1147 of 1727) among patients who did receive ventilation (table 2). Thus, the probability of being ventilated was 12% (580 of 4822) for women and 22% (1147 of 5199) for men.\nThe most common comorbidities were hypertension (5575 [56%] of 10 021), diabetes (2791 [28%]), cardiac arrythmia (2699 [27%]), renal failure (2287 [23%]), heart failure (1963 [20%]), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 1358 [14%]; table 1). 6% (590 of 10 021) of the patients were obese. Furthermore, 6% (599 of 10 021) of all patients received dialysis during hospitalisation. All comorbidities, as well as the number of patients receiving dialysis, were higher in the ventilated group compared with the non-ventilated group. 39% (3237 of 8294) of patients in the non-ventilated group and 22% (374 of 1727) of patients in the ventilated group had a Charlson comorbidity index of 0. In the ventilated group, more than 50% had an index of 2 or higher (figure 1B).\nThe mean length of hospital stay was 14 3 days (SD 13 8) overall, with a mean of 12 0 days (11 3) in the non-ventilated group and 25 2 days (18 5) in the ventilated group (table 1, appendix pp 2, 4). 27% (461 of 1727) of all ventilated patients were transferred between hospitals.\nDuration of mechanical ventilation by ventilation type\n(A) Duration of mechanical ventilation by type of ventilation and survival status. Box plots show medians and IQRs. Means are shown with large circles. Outliers are shown with small circles. (B) Distribution of the duration of mechanical ventilation.\nIn the ventilated group, mean ventilation duration was 13 5 days (SD 12 1), ranging from 3 6 days (4 2) in patients receiving non-invasive ventilation only to 17 1 (12 7) in patients with non-invasive ventilation failure (table 1). The differences in duration of mechanical ventilation between patients who survived and those who did not were modest (figure 2A ). Additionally, figure 2B shows the distribution of mechanical ventilation duration by type of ventilation. 26% (445 of 1727) of all patients with ventilation were tracheostomised (table 1).\nIn-hospital mortality\n(A) In-hospital survival with and without mechanical ventilation. (B) In-hospital mortality with and without mechanical ventilation by age.\nOverall, in-hospital mortality was 22% (2229 of 10 021), with wide variation between groups (table 1, figure 3A ). In-hospital mortality was 16% (1323 of 8294) for patients without mechanical ventilation, and 53% (906 of 1727) with mechanical ventilation (non-invasive ventilation 45% [65 of 145], non-invasive ventilation failure 50% [70 of 141], and invasive mechanical ventilation 53% [696 of 1318]; appendix p 3). Disaggregating by age, in-hospital mortality in the ventilated group was 28% (117 of 422) in patients aged 18-59 years, 46% (174 of 382) in patients aged 60-69 years, 63% (335 of 535) in patients aged 70-79 years, and 72% (280 of 388) in patients aged 80 years or older (figure 3B). In the same age groups, in-hospital mortality was lower in patients without mechanical ventilation: 1% (18 of 2474) in patients aged 18-59 years, 5% (67 of 1239) in patients aged 60-69 years, 15% (237 of 1623) in patients aged 70-79 years, and 34% (1001 of 2958) in patients aged 80 years or older (figure 3B, appendix p 4). In-hospital mortality in ventilated patients who were also treated with dialysis was particularly high at 73% (342 of 469), and 71% (84 of 119) of patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation died (appendix p 4). Furthermore, mortality did not change considerably over the study period (appendix p 5). Because most patients were not ventilated, in absolute terms, more patients died without ventilation (n=1323) than with ventilation (n=906).\nDuration of hospital stay and mechanical ventilation by survival status in ventilated patients\nDistribution of length of hospital stay (A) and duration of mechanical ventilation (B) in survivors and non-survivors.\nStratifying the group of ventilated patients by length of hospital stay (figure 4A ) and duration of ventilation (figure 4B) shows that the probability of dying was particularly high in the first 10 days of hospitalisation. A length of stay of more than 18 days was associated with survival (figure 4A), whereas no such association was seen for duration of ventilation (figure 4B).\nDiscussion\nThis study describes the characteristics of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in a large, unselected, and unbiased nationwide cohort of 10 021 patients admitted to 920 hospitals in Germany, including during the peak of admissions at the end of March, 2020, and in the first half of April (ie, up to 2 weeks after the peak of new infections). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of in-hospital mortality in a large group of patients with COVID-19 in Germany. The main findings of our study were that most patients were aged 70 years or older, that patients on mechanical ventilation had more comorbidities than patients without mechanical ventilation, and that mortality was high, with a mortality of 53% in patients being mechanically ventilated and 73% in patients requiring both ventilation and dialysis. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 22%, which is similar to that reported in France, but considerably lower than in the UK where in-hospital mortality was reported to be 39%, if only patients who were discharged or died in hospital are taken into account. However, the age distribution of patients, particularly of patients admitted to hospital and of those on mechanical ventilation, generally differs between the European countries.\nMortality was particularly high for patients on mechanical ventilation (53%), reaching 63% in patients aged 70-79 years and 72% in patients aged 80 years and older. These mortality rates are higher than those for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the New York cohort reported by Richardson and colleagues, mortality was 24 5%, including patients remaining in the ICU. However, if only patients discharged from the ICU were included in the analysis, as done in our cohort, mortality among patients aged 18-65 years and those older than 65 years would be substantially higher. Of note, the smaller proportion of patients receiving mechanical ventilation and the higher in-hospital mortality in New York could reflect an overburdened health-care system. The Intensive Care National Audit &amp; Research Centre reports an ICU mortality for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland of slightly less than 30% in patients younger than 60 years, consistent with our data, and of 60-80% in patients aged 60 years and older. In patients aged 60 years or older in particular, mortality is nearly 75% in those receiving renal replacement therapy. \nOur data indicate that half of all deaths among ventilated patients occurred in the first 12 days after hospital admission. Furthermore, patients requiring both ventilation and dialysis had the highest in-hospital mortality of 73%, possibly due to multiorgan failure or renal tropism of the virus. \nIn general, our data show the high morbidity and mortality in older patients, with a considerably lower mortality for patients younger than 60 years. In particular, mortality is very high in patients older than 70 years, reaching 72% in patients aged 80 years or older with ventilation, which is in line with data reported from the UK and from patients undergoing surgery. Of note, mortality also reached 34% in patients aged 80 years and older without mechanical ventilation. These results provide new information relevant to patient allocation during the pandemic, especially in times of high ICU demand. Countries such as Italy, the UK, and France, which had limited ICU bed resources, high infection rates, and particularly high COVID-19-related deaths during the first wave of the pandemic, admitted fewer older patients to high-care ICU treatment, including invasive mechanical ventilation. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, only 20 3% of patients with COVID-19 being treated in ICUs were older than 70 years (and only 2 6% were older than 80 years), compared with 54% (and 23%) in our patient population. Data from the German ICU registry shows that there was sufficient ICU capacity throughout the study period, which could be a major explanation for the large number of older patients being mechanically ventilated in Germany.\nComorbidities are a major risk factor for requiring mechanical ventilation in COVID-19, with mortality of women and men on ventilation being equal. The high in-hospital mortality for ventilated patients is lower if patients can be treated with non-invasive ventilation alone, although 60% of such patients had a Charlson comorbidity index of 2 or more. Our data cannot distinguish whether the treatment or the severity of the disease accounts for this more preferential outcome. On the one hand, if patients can be treated with non-invasive ventilation alone, mortality is low, as has been shown for other diseases, such as acute exacerbated COPD. On the other hand, non-invasive ventilation failure is associated with mortality almost as high as invasive mechanical ventilation, highlighting that the indications and limits of non-invasive ventilation in COVID-19 need to be determined. Moreover, 27% of patients on mechanical ventilation required dialysis. In-hospital mortality in this group of patients was very high at 73%, indicating that acute renal failure must be prevented in patients with COVID-19 as far as possible. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used in 7% of all patients on mechanical ventilation, with a high mortality of 71%. These data might show the heterogeneity of treatment and widespread use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in Germany because data from the EuroELSO show a more preferential outcome in dedicated centres. \nOne key factor in containing the pandemic is access to and availability of ICU beds. Therefore, prognostic models have been established which could guide patient allocation and lockdown measures. In this context, the duration of mechanical ventilation is an important factor; the mean duration in this cohort was 13 5 days (SD 12 1); median 10 days [IQR 5-19]). However, a substantial number of patients were on long-term invasive mechanical ventilation above the upper limit of the IQR, which has a considerable impact on accessible ICU beds in a severe phase of the pandemic. Therefore, long-term care facilities might have a substantial effect in generating free ICU capacity.\nOne limitation of our study is the data source, which includes only patients from the largest group of German sickness funds. However, they account for around a third of the total population, giving a large sample representative for the German population, even if the very old (&gt;=80 years) are over-represented. Hospital data are of high quality because disease codes and procedure codes are relevant for the amount of remuneration and are therefore verified by hospitals and sickness funds. Nevertheless, codes can be missing if there is no impact on remuneration. Second, patient-specific data are limited to diagnoses, procedures, and initial characteristics. Third, with respect to mechanical ventilation, this observational study cannot distinguish between treatment effects and severity of the disease, particularly with regard to the use of non-invasive ventilation in COVID-19. Fourth, we stratified by mechanical ventilation but not by ICU treatment, which sometimes includes high-flow oxygen therapy without mechanical ventilation. Due to the absence of codes, the absence of incentives for coding, or both, continuous positive airway pressure and high-flow oxygen therapy could not be analysed. Fifth, we could not differentiate between patients who had been hospitalised for COVID-19 or for any other reason, or similarly for mortality, whether mortality was related to COVID-19 or an underlying medical condition. Sixth, we do not currently have outpatient data available, and therefore we cannot distinguish between acute and chronic comorbidities, particularly with regard to renal failure.\nIn the German health-care system, in which capacity limits were not reached during the first wave of COVID-19 cases, in-hospital mortality was 22%, similar to that in France where the hospitalisation rate was much higher. In-hospital mortality was considerably lower for patients younger than 60 years than those aged 80 years or older, and was even lower than expected for more severe forms of ARDS. Older patients and those requiring dialysis had the worst prognosis, with an in-hospital mortality of almost 75%. Furthermore, men had a higher severity of disease than women, but have similar outcomes when ventilated. With unrestrained resources, a small but considerable number of older patients and patients with comorbidities can survive severe forms of COVID-19, but in the event of a strong second wave of the pandemic, longer treatment times could limit hospital capacities.\nData sharing\nThe data used in this study cannot be made available in the manuscript, the supplemental files, or in a public repository due to German data protection laws (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz).

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"Background\nSurgeons urgently need guidance on how to deliver surgical services safely and effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n The aim was to identify the key domains that should be considered when developing pandemic preparedness plans for surgical services.\n\n\nMethods\nA scoping search was conducted to identify published articles relating to management of surgical patients during pandemics.\n\n Key informant interviews were conducted with surgeons and anaesthetists with direct experience of working during infectious disease outbreaks, in order to identify key challenges and solutions to delivering effective surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nResults\nThirteen articles were identified from the scoping search, and surgeons and anaesthetists representing 11 territories were interviewed.\n\n To mount an effective response to COVID-19, a pandemic response plan for surgical services should be developed in advance.\n\n Key domains that should be included are: provision of staff training (such as patient transfers, donning and doffing personal protection equipment, recognizing and managing COVID-19 infection); support for the overall hospital response to COVID-19 (reduction in non-urgent activities such as clinics, endoscopy, non-urgent elective surgery); establishment of a team-based approach for running emergency services; and recognition and management of COVID-19 infection in patients treated as an emergency and those who have had surgery.\n\n A backlog of procedures after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is inevitable, and hospitals should plan how to address this effectively to ensure that patients having elective treatment have the best possible outcomes.\n\n\nConclusion\nHospitals should prepare detailed context-specific pandemic preparedness plans addressing the identified domains.\n\n Specific guidance should be updated continuously to reflect emerging evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7262310","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

On ICU admission, standard oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, and non-invasive ventilation were applied to 29%, 19%, and 6% patients, respectively.\n\n 2635 (63%) patients were intubated during the first 24 h whereas overall 3376 (80%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) at one point during their ICU stay.\n\n Median (IQR) positive end-expiratory and plateau pressures were 12 (10–14)

of patients intubated at Day-1, respectively.\n\n Pulmonary embolism and ventilator-associated pneumonia were diagnosed in 207 (9%) and 1209 (58%) of these patients.\n\n On day 90, 1298/4244 (31%) patients had died.\n\n Among patients who received invasive or non-invasive ventilation on the day of ICU admission, day-90 mortality increased with the severity of ARDS at ICU admission (30%, 34%, and 50% for mild, moderate, and severe ARDS, respectively) and decreased from 42 to 25% over the study period.\n\n Early independent predictors of 90-day mortality were older age, immunosuppression, severe obesity, diabetes, higher renal and cardiovascular SOFA score components, lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio and a shorter time between first symptoms and ICU admission.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Among more than 4000 critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to our ICUs, 90-day mortality was 31% and decreased from 42 to 25% over the study period.\n\n Mortality was higher in older, diabetic,

study\nPurpose\nTo describe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) severity, ventilation management, and the outcomes of ICU patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and to determine risk factors of 90-day mortality post-ICU admission.\nMethods\nCOVID-ICU is a multi-center, prospective cohort study conducted in 138 hospitals in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. Demographic, clinical, respiratory support, adjunctive interventions, ICU length-of-stay, and survival data were collected.\nResults\nFrom February 25 to May 4, 2020, 4643 patients (median [IQR] age 63 [54-71] years and SAPS II 37 [28-50]) were admitted in ICU, with day-90 post-ICU admission status available for 4244. On ICU admission, standard oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, and non-invasive ventilation were applied to 29%, 19%, and 6% patients, respectively. 2635 (63%) patients were intubated during the first 24 h whereas overall 3376 (80%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) at one point during their ICU stay. Median (IQR) positive end-expiratory and plateau pressures were 12 (10-14) cmH2O, and 24 (21-27) cmH2O, respectively. The mechanical power transmitted by the MV to the lung was 26.5 (18.6-34.9) J/min. Paralyzing agents and prone position were applied to 88% and 70% of patients intubated at Day-1, respectively. Pulmonary embolism and ventilator-associated pneumonia were diagnosed in 207 (9%) and 1209 (58%) of these patients. On day 90, 1298/4244 (31%) patients had died. Among patients who received invasive or non-invasive ventilation on the day of ICU admission, day-90 mortality increased with the severity of ARDS at ICU admission (30%, 34%, and 50% for mild, moderate, and severe ARDS, respectively) and decreased from 42 to 25% over the study period. Early independent predictors of 90-day mortality were older age, immunosuppression, severe obesity, diabetes, higher renal and cardiovascular SOFA score components, lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio and a shorter time between first symptoms and ICU admission.\nConclusion\nAmong more than 4000 critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to our ICUs, 90-day mortality was 31% and decreased from 42 to 25% over the study period. Mortality was higher in older, diabetic, obese and severe ARDS patients.\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00134-020-06294-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\nTake-home message\nIn this cohort study that included 4244 adult patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection admitted to the ICU, 80% received invasive mechanical ventilation. Mortality 90 days after ICU admission was 31% in the whole cohort and 37% in the subgroup of patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation on the day of ICU admission. Among these patients with early intubation, mortality increased with the severity of ARDS at ICU admission (30%, 34%, and 50% for mild, moderate, and severe ARDS, respectively).	 	\nIntroduction\nFrom March to May 2020, Europe was massively affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. In that context, the REVA network designed a specific registry (COVID-ICU), to prospectively collect characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for severe COVID-19 in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. In France, as of October 1st, 2020, 395,104 patients had been tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 32,365 deaths have been associated with the disease. On April 8, 2020, the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in French ICUs peaked at 7148.\nA few case-series have described baseline characteristics and short-term mortality (up to 28-days after ICU admission) ranging from 26 to more than 50% in critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, recovery from severe COVID-19 often takes several weeks and a substantial number of these patients were still in the ICU or the hospital at the time their outcome was evaluated. Notably, 28-day mortality was 41% in the control care group of the RECOVERY trial, which showed that dexamethasone improved the survival of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen at randomization.\nThe present study reports data of 4244 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the ICU and for whom day-90 status was available. We also evaluated risk factors associated with 90-day mortality in these critically ill patients.\nMethods\nStudy Design, Patients\nCOVID-ICU is a multi-center, prospective cohort study conducted in 149 ICUs from 138 centers, across three countries (France, Switzerland, and Belgium). Centers were invited to participate by public announcements and by the Reseau European de recherche en Ventilation Artificielle (REVA) network (70 centers were active members of this network). We included in the present report data from participating ICUs that had enrolled at least one patient with complete data on age and 90-day vital status. COVID-ICU received approval from the ethical committee of the French Intensive Care Society (CE-SRLF 20-23) in accordance with our local regulations. All patients or close relatives were informed that their data were included in the COVID-ICU cohort.\nAll consecutive patients over 16 years of age admitted to the participating ICU between February 25, 2020, and May 4, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were included. Laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a positive result of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from either nasal or pharyngeal swabs, or lower respiratory tract aspirates. Patients without laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were not included, even if they presented with a typical radiological pattern.\nInclusions were stopped on May 4, 2020, after enrollment of 4643 patients admitted to the ICU. Survival status up to 90 days after ICU admission was obtained for 4244 of them.\nData collection\nDay 1 was defined as the first day when the patient was in ICU at 10 am. Each day, the study investigators completed a standardized electronic case report form. Baseline information collected at ICU admission were: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), active smoking, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), comorbidities, immunodeficiency (if present), clinical frailty scale, date of the first symptom, dates of the hospital and ICU admissions. The case report form prompted investigators to provide a daily-expanded data set including respiratory support devices (oxygen mask, high flow nasal cannula, or non-invasive ventilation), mechanical ventilation settings (positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), respiratory rate, tidal volume, plateau pressure, arterial blood gas, standard laboratory parameters, and adjuvant therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) such as the use of continuous neuromuscular blockers, nitric oxide, prone position, corticosteroids, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation until day-90. Driving pressure was defined as plateau pressure minus PEEP and mechanical power (J/min) was calculated as follows: Mechanical power (J/min) = 0.098 x tidal volume x respiratory rate x (peak pressure - 1/2 x driving pressure). If not specified, peak pressure was considered equal to plateau pressure. Ventilatory ratio was defined as (minute ventilation x PaCO2) - (predicted bodyweight x 100 x 37.5).\nARDS severity, complications, and outcomes\nARDS was graded based on the Berlin definition for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive) on ICU day 1. Patients on nasal, mask or high-flow oxygen therapy were not included in this group. However, their day-1 PaO2/FiO2 was calculated by converting O2 flow to estimated FiO2 (see conversion tables in the supplement). ICU-complications and organ dysfunction included acute kidney failure requiring renal replacement therapy, thromboembolic complications (distal venous thrombosis or proven pulmonary embolism by either pulmonary CT angiography or cardiac echography), ventilator-associated pneumonia, and cardiac arrest. Clinical suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia was confirmed before antibiotics either by quantitative distal bronchoalveolar lavage cultures growing &gt;= 104 cfu/mL, blind protected specimen brush distal growing &gt;= 103 cfu/mL, or endotracheal aspirates growing &gt;= 106 cfu/mL.\nPatient outcomes included the date of liberation from mechanical ventilation, dates of ICU and hospital discharge, vital status at ICU and hospital discharge, and 28, 60, and 90 days after ICU admission.\nStatistical analyses\nCharacteristics of patients were described as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables. Categorical variables were compared by Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables were compared by Student's t test or Wilcoxon's rank-sum test. Kaplan-Meier overall survival curves until Day 90 were computed, and were compared using log-rank tests. The median length of stay in ICU and in hospital were also estimated using a Kaplan-Meier estimator to take into account patients that may be still in ICU at the time of the analysis.\nBaseline risk factors of death at Day 90 were assessed within the whole cohort using univariate and multivariate cox regression. Baseline variables (i.e., obtained during the first 24 h in the ICU) included in the multivariate model were defined a priori, and no variable selection was performed (see the description of the statistical analysis plan in the Supplement). ICU admission dates were split into four calendar periods (i.e., before March, 15; from March 16 to 31; from April 1 to 15; and after April 16). Proportional hazard assumption was assessed by inspecting the scaled Shoenfeld residuals and Harrel's test (Table S4). Multiple imputations were used to replace missing values when appropriate (Figure S1-S2). Ten copies of the dataset were created with the missing values replaced by imputed values, based on observed data including outcomes and baseline characteristics of participants. Each dataset was then analyzed and the results from each dataset were pooled into a final result using Rubin's rule. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis using a Cox model stratified on the center variable was also performed. Hazard ratios and their 95% confidence interval were estimated. A p value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyzes were conducted with R v3.5.1.\nResults\nParticipating ICUs and Patients Enrolled\nPatients were included in 149 ICUs (71 [48%] university, 66 [44%] public regional, and 12 [8%] private, semi-private, or military hospitals, respectively) from 138 centers in three countries. The median (interquartile) number of ICU beds in these centers and these ICUs were 26 (18-55) and 20 (14-28), respectively. Fifty-six percent of the patients were recruited in Paris and the surrounding area (see Table S1-S3 in the Supplement for an extensive description of ICUs and center characteristics). Ninety-four percent of the centers reported having extended the number of ICU beds during the COVID-19 outbreak.\nFlowchart of patients screening and inclusion.

ICU intensive care unit\nOverall 90-day mortality was 31%. Within the first 7 days after ICU admission, 64 (12%, 95 confidence interval [CI], 9-15%) patients with mild and 183 (16%, 95 CI 14-18%) with moderate ARDS progressed to severe ARDS. In patients on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive) at ICU day one, 90-day mortality was 820/2233 (37%), and increased with the severity of ARDS at ICU admission (30%, 34% and 50% in mild, moderate, and severe ARDS patients, respectively) (Table 3 and Fig. 2). 90-day mortality was 292/1219 (24%), 202/786 (26%), and 96/230 (42%) in patients who received standard oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, or non-invasive ventilation at day-1. Noticeably, 90-day mortality declined over time from 42 to 25% (p &lt; 0.001) in the first and the last period, respectively (Table S5 and Figure S3). Of note, 90-day mortality was 36% in patients intubated during their ICU stay and 11% for those not intubated (see Table S7). The overall median durations of mechanical ventilation, ICU, and hospital stay for 90-day survivors were 13 (8-18), 21 (13-36), and 30 (20-48) days, respectively. Of note, these durations increased with the severity of the ARDS (Table 3).\nPredictive patient factors associated with 90-day mortality in critically ill adults with COVID-19\n	No.	Univariate HR (95% CI)	P value	Multivariate HR (95% CI)a	P value	 	Age, years	4244	1.05 (1.04-1.05)	&lt; 0.001	1.05 (1.04-1.06)	&lt; 0.001	 	Date of ICU admission	4244		&lt; 0.001		0.311	 	 Before March, 15		-		-		 	 From March, 16 to 31		0.69 (0.56-0.84)		0.86 (0.64-1.16)		 	 From April, 1 to 15		0.61 (0.50-0.76)		0.75 (0.54-1.04)		 	 After April, 16		0.54 (0.40-0.72)		0.82 (0.52-1.29)		 	Immunodeficiency	4192	1.64 (1.38-1.96)	&lt; 0.001	1.38 (1.06-1.80)	0.020	 	Body mass index, kg/m2b	3935		0.013		0.007	 	 &lt; 25		-		-		 	 25 &lt;= BMI &lt; 30		0.92 (0.68-1.25)		1.06 (0.78-1.43)		 			0.77 (0.57-1.03)		0.81 (0.60-1.10)		 	 30 &lt;= BMI &lt; 35		0.94 (0.68-1.29)		1.11 (0.80-1.55)		 			0.59 (0.42-0.83)		0.63 (0.44-0.89)		 	 35 &lt;= BMI &lt; 40		1.16 (0.79-1.69)		1.50 (1.02-2.21)		 			0.49 (0.30-0.79)		0.60 (0.37-0.97)		 	 &gt;= 40		1.47 (0.93-2.33)		2.05 (1.28-3.27)		 			0.60 (0.32-1.14)		0.87 (0.45-1.66)		 	Active smokingb	3935	1.51 (0.96-2.36)	0.225	1.30 (0.82-2.05)	0.314	 			0.87 (0.45-1.70)		0.71 (0.36-1.39)		 	Treated hypertension	4197	1.44 (1.29-1.60)	&lt; 0.001	1.01 (0.85-1.19)	0.940	 	Known diabetes	4196	1.62 (1.44-1.81)	&lt; 0.001	1.51 (1.28-1.78)	&lt; 0.001	 	Time between first symptoms to ICU admission, days	3862		&lt; 0.001		0.010	 	 &lt; 4 days		-		-		 	 4-7 days		0.87 (0.65-1.16)		1.07 (0.80-1.43)		 	 &gt;= 8 days		0.52 (0.39-0.70)		0.73 (0.54-0.98)		 	During the first 24 h in the ICU						 	 CV component of the SOFA score &gt;= 3	4065	1.77 (1.58-1.98)	&lt; 0.001	1.79 (1.52-2.11)	&lt; 0.001	 	 Renal component of the SOFA score &gt;= 3b	4014	3.01 (2.30-3.92)	&lt; 0.001	2.38 (1.81-3.13)	&lt; 0.001	 			1.66 (1.11-2.48)		1.32 (0.87-2.01)		 	 Coagulation component of the SOFA score &gt;= 3	4002	2.01 (1.21-3.34)	0.016	1.73 (0.81-3.69)	0.190	 	 PaO2/FiO2c	3080		&lt; 0.001		&lt; 0.001	 	  200 &lt; PaO2/FiO2 &lt;= 300		0.94 (0.72-1.21)		0.93 (0.67-1.29)		 	  100 &lt; PaO2/FiO2 &lt;= 200		1.09 (0.87-1.38)		1.12 (0.83-1.51)		 	  PaO2/FiO2 &lt;= 100		1.73 (1.36-2.19)		2.05 (1.51-2.78)		 	 Lymphocyte count &lt;= 1 x 109/Lb	3481	0.92 (0.75-1.14)	0.008	0.80 (0.65-0.99)	0.030	 			1.46 (1.14-1.88)		1.24 (0.96-1.60)		 	pH	4003	0.67 (0.60-0.75)	&lt; 0.001	0.80 (0.65-0.97)	0.065	 	\nBMI body mass index, CV cardiovascular, SOFA Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, ICU intensive care unit, HR hazard ratio, CI confidence interval\naComplete analysis cases on 2152 patients\nbEarly effect before 14 days of follow-up (first line); late effects (i.e., after day-15) in the second line\ncCalculated for all patients, including those on oxygen therapy using conversion tables provided in the online supplement\nResults of the multivariable analysis are reported in Table 4. After inspection of the proportional hazard assumption, a time-varying effect was introduced in the multivariate Cox model for four variables: body mass index, active smoking, renal component of the SOFA score, and lymphopenia. Thus, for these variables, two types of hazard ratio are reported, indicating the early effect (before 14 days of follow-up) or the late effect (after 15 days of follow-up) of the corresponding baseline characteristic on the risk of death, respectively.\nNon-survivors were older, and more frequently diabetic or immunocompromised than survivors. At ICU admission, they had a higher renal and hemodynamic SOFA component scores and lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Interestingly, they also had a shorter time since the onset of the first symptoms. Day-1 patients' characteristics significantly associated with higher 90-day mortality identified by the Cox regression model were older age, known diabetes, class 2 and extreme obesity, immunodeficiency, higher renal and cardiovascular components of the SOFA score, lower PaO2/FiO2, lower pH, and a shorter time between first symptoms and ICU admission (Table 4). The same analysis re-run after multiple imputations of missing data (Table S8), and a sensitivity analysis introducing the center variable as a stratification variable in the multivariable model yielded similar results (Table S9). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates according to age, ICU admission period, the renal component of the SOFA score, the delay between the first symptoms and ICU admission, immunocompromised status, diabetes, severe lymphopenia, and static pulmonary compliance categories at day-1 are provided in Figs. 2b, S4-S10. Lastly, outcomes of patients who progressed from mild to moderate or severe ARDS and those who progressed from moderate to severe ARDS within the first week of mechanical ventilation are reported in Fig. 2c, d.\nDiscussion\nWe report herein one of the largest prospective case-series of COVID-19 patients who required intensive care admission, with detailed information on their baseline characteristics, ARDS severity, and 90-day outcomes. Overall 90-day mortality was 31% and was higher in older and obese patients, diabetics, immunocompromised patients, and those who had multiple organ dysfunction at ICU admission. 90-day mortality rates were 30%, 34%, and 50%, in patients with mild, moderate, and severe ARDS who were on mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive) on ICU day-1, respectively. Noticeably, mortality rates decreased over time during the study period, while ICU and hospital length of stay were substantially longer than in other cohorts of ARDS patients.\nAcute respiratory failure was the main indication for ICU admission, with 80% of our COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation which is consistent with the experience in Lombardy, Italy, where 88% of ICU patients were intubated. However, lower rates of intubation in ICU patients were reported in Wuhan, China by Wang et al. (47%), and Yang et al. (42%), and in Washington state, USA (71%). While early single-center reports in small groups of COVID patients reported well-preserved lung mechanics despite the severity of hypoxemia, more recent data and our observations suggested that lung compliance and driving pressure were close to those of reported in classical ARDS. Mechanical power which is the energy delivered to the respiratory system over time during mechanical ventilation was very high in our patients with ARDS, reaching 26.5 (18.6-34.9) J/min, while a higher mortality risk has been suggested for patients with ARDS whose value exceeded 17 J/min. In that context, the application of evidence-based ARDS care, such as lung-protective mechanical ventilation and proning are both warranted. ECMO, which was used in 15% of severe ARDS in our cohort should be considered when these measures have failed.\n28-day mortality was 39% in 257 critically-ill COVID-19 patients in New-York city, of whom 203 (79%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 41% in patients on invasive mechanical ventilation included in the usual care group of the RECOVERY randomized trial and &gt; 50% in 733 Chinese patients admitted in the ICU. Despite similar severity at baseline, day-28 mortality were 26% in the whole cohort and 30% in our patients intubated at day-1, a rate close to that reported in the large LUNG-SAFE study. Different characteristics of patients admitted to ICUs and different degrees of stress on healthcare systems could explain these discrepancies. Besides, we report a progressive decrease in 90-day mortality over the study period with a higher proportion of patients on high flow oxygen and non-invasive ventilation and a lower rate of intubation on ICU day-1 in the last period of the study (Table S5 and Figure S3). Similar findings have been reported by other groups and might reflect better knowledge of the pathophysiology of the disease over time and less reluctance to use non-invasive oxygenation strategies. It should however be noticed that duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of ICU and hospital stays were substantially longer than those of in ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. For instance, ICU length of stay in patients surviving severe ARDS was 26 (13-43) days, compared to 14 (7-23) days in the LUNG-SAFE study. These patients rapidly overwhelmed ICU's capacity, forcing a major reorganization of ICU beds during the crisis.\nIdentifying the determinants of outcomes of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 is crucial to optimize the use of ICU care and other hospital resources. Older age, obesity, diabetes, being immunocompromised, lower PaO2/FiO2 and higher hemodynamic and renal SOFA score at ICU admission were independently associated with 90-day mortality, highlighting the dismal impact of premorbid conditions and multiorgan damage on the outcomes of patients with the most severe forms of COVID-19. The rate of patients with a BMI &gt;= 30 kg/m2) was 41% in our cohort and unusually high compared to the prevalence of obesity in the French population. More severe COVID-19 in obese patients may be explained by impairments in the adaptive immune response, cardiometabolic and thrombotic derangements, and alterations in lung function. Obesity may also be a marker of poorer baseline health conditions since it is frequently associated with a lower socio-economic status. As previously reported, a shorter time between first symptoms and ICU admission was also independently associated with increased mortality. Lastly, we and others observed an unusually high rate of thromboembolic complications, with 9% of proven pulmonary embolism. This rate may likely be higher since pulmonary CT angiography was not systematically performed in all patients. Diffuse vascular endothelium injury and intense activation of the coagulation cascade may explain this increased risk of venous thrombosis.\nThe major strength of this study is the detailed report of physiological, clinical features, ventilatory management, and 90-day outcomes of a large, multicenter series of 4244 critically ill COVID-19 patients. We acknowledge several limitations to our study. First, we conducted this cohort at a time where the national health system was extremely pressured with a need for a large number of ICU beds in some regions. Then, we cannot rule out that ICU admission policies and patients' management were similar in all centers, although a sensitivity analysis introducing the center variable in the multivariable model found similar results. Second, testing was not standardized across sites, which might have led to misclassification. Third, some variables have missing data (as reported in the tables) due to a large number of patients included in a short period and intense clinical activity during the crisis. Indeed, our multivariable model included only 51% of the whole cohort of patients because of these missing data, which may explain, together with other residual confounders, the unanticipated lower mortality before 14 days of follow-up associated with baseline lymphopenia . However, this association was no longer statistically significant in the model with multiple imputations. Fourth, Grasselli et al. recently reported that high D-dimer concentration was significantly associated with mortality in COVID-19-related ARDS patients when associated with low values of static respiratory system compliance. Unfortunately, we were unable to confirm that result in our multivariable model due to inconsistent collection of this data at ICU admission.\nConclusions\nIn this case series of 4244 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our ICUs, overall 90-day mortality was 31% and decreased over time during the study period. Mortality was higher in older patients, immunocompromised, extreme obese, diabetics, those with a shorter delay between first symptoms and ICU admission, and those with extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction at ICU admission. Ninety-day mortality increased with the severity of ARDS from 30% in mild to 50% in severe ARDS. These information, together with the very long durations of mechanical ventilation and of ICU stay, which have contributed to the swamping of our ICU's capacity, will be critical for the management of the second wave of the epidemic. Lastly, long-term follow-up is warranted to provide a complete description of the outcomes and potential sequelae associated with the most severe forms of COVID-19 requiring ICU treatment.\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nManagement and Writing Committee and COVID-ICU Investigators are listed in &quot;Acknowledgement&quot; section.\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nAuthor contributions\nMS and DH had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care.\n\n Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI],

Simple Tool That Predicts Length of Stay","abstract":"Background\nFrailty is characterized by increased vulnerability to external stressors.\n\n When frail older adults are admitted to hospital, they are at increased risk of adverse events including falls, delirium, and disability.\n\n The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a practical and efficient tool for assessing frailty; however, its ability to predict outcomes has not been well studied within the acute medical service.\n\n\nObjective\nTo examine the CFS in elderly patients admitted to the acute medical ward and its association with length of stay.\n\n\nDesign\nProspective cohort study in an acute care university hospital in London, Ontario, Canada, involving 75 patients over age 65, admitted to the general internal medicine clinical teaching units (CTU).\n\n\nMeasurements\nPatient demographics were collected through chart review, and CFS score was assigned to each patient after brief clinician assessment.\n\n The CFS ranges from 1 (very fit) to 9 (terminally ill) based on descriptors and pictographs of activity and functional status.\n\n The CFS was collapsed into three categories: non-frail (CFS 1–4), mild-to-moderately frail (CFS 5–6), and severely frail (CFS 7–8).\n\n Outcomes of length of stay and 90-day readmission were gathered through the LHSC electronic patient record.\n\n\nResults\nSevere frailty was associated with longer lengths of stay (Mean = 12.6 ± 12.7 days) compared to mild-to-moderate frailty (mean = 11.2 ± 10.8 days), and non-frailty (mean = 4.1 ± 2.1 days, p = .\n\n014).\n\n This finding was significant after adjusting for age, sex, and number of medications.\n\n Participants with higher frailty scores showed higher readmission rates when compared with those with no frailty (31.2% for severely frail, vs.\n\n 34.2% for mild-to-moderately frail vs.\n\n 19% for non-frail) although there was no significant difference in the adjusted analysis.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe CFS helped identify patients that are more likely to have prolonged hospital stays on the acute medical ward.\n\n The CFS is an easy to use tool which can detect older adults at high risk of complicated course and longer stay.\n\n Objective early identification of seniors with frailty in acute care units can help to target interventions to prevent complications and to implement effective discharge planning in high risk older adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4922366","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Canadian Geriatrics

studied in hospitalized patients.\n\n Aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of frailty and to determine the extent that frailty predicts delirium, falls and mortality in hospitalized older patients.\n\n\nMethods\nIn a prospective study of 220 older patients, frailty was determined using the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and the Study of Osteoporotic Fracture (SOF) frailty index.\n\n Patients were classified as nonfrail, prefrail, and frail, according to the specific criteria.\n\n Covariates included clinical and laboratory parameters.\n\n Outcome variables included in hospital delirium and falls, and 6-month mortality.\n\n\nResults\nThe CHS frailty index was available in all 220 patients, of which 1.5% were classified as being nonfrail, 58.5% as prefrail, and 40% as frail.\n\n The SOF frailty index was available in 204 patients, of which 16% were classified as being nonfrail, 51.5% as prefrail, and 32.5% as frail.\n\n Frailty, as identified by the CHS and SOF indexes, was a significant risk factor for 6-month mortality.\n\n However, after adjustment for multiple risk factors, frailty remained a strong independent risk factor only for the model with the CHS index (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.7-12.8).\n\n Frailty (identified by CHS and SOF indexes) was not found to be a risk factor for delirium or falls.\n\n\nConclusions\nFrailty, as measured by the CHS index, is an independent risk factor for 6-month mortality.\n\n The CHS and the SOF indexes have limited value as risk assessment tools for specific geriatric syndromes (e.\n\ng.\n\n, falls and delirium) in hospitalized older patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3905102","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

affecting thousands of people around the world.\n\n Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.\n\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries.\n\n All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form.\n\n The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU.\n\n We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU.\n\n We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care.\n\n We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility.\n\n Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations.\n\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations.\n\n No recommendation was provided for 6 questions.\n\n The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill

All patients were sedated, paralysed, and ventilated in volume-control mode with standard ICU ventilators.\n\n Static respiratory system compliance, the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air, ventilatory ratio (a surrogate of dead space), and D-dimer concentrations were measured within 24 h of ICU admission.\n\n Lung CT scans and CT angiograms were done when clinically indicated.\n\n A dataset for ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 was created from previous ARDS studies.\n\n Survival to day 28 was assessed.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 9 and March 22, 2020, 301 patients with COVID-19 met the Berlin criteria for ARDS at participating hospitals.\n\n Median static compliance was 41 mL/cm H2O (33–52), which was 28% higher than in the cohort of patients with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 (32 mL/cm H2O [25–43]; p&lt;0·0001).\n\n 17 (6%) of 297 patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS had compliances greater than the 95th percentile of the classical ARDS cohort.\n\n Total lung weight did not differ between the two cohorts.\n\n CT pulmonary angiograms (obtained in 23 [8%] patients with COVID-19-related ARDS) showed that 15 (94%) of 16 patients with D-dimer concentrations greater than the median had bilateral areas of hypoperfusion, consistent with thromboembolic disease.\n\n Patients with D-dimer concentrations equal to or less than the median had ventilatory ratios lower than those of patients with D-dimer concentrations greater than the median (1·66 [1·32–1·95] vs 1·90 [1·50–2·33]; p=0·0001).\n\n Patients with static compliance equal to or less than the median and D-dimer concentrations greater than the median had markedly increased 28-day mortality compared with other patient subgroups (40 [56%] of 71 with high D-dimers and low compliance vs 18 [27%] of 67 with low D-dimers and high compliance, 13 [22%] of 60 with low D-dimers and low compliance, and 22 [35%] of 63 with high D-dimers and high compliance, all p=0·0001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients with COVID-19-associated ARDS have a form of injury that, in many aspects, is similar to that of those with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. Notably, patients with COVID-19-related ARDS who have a reduction in respiratory system compliance together with increased D-dimer concentrations have high mortality rates.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7834127","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Giacomo","surname":"Grasselli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tommaso","surname":"Tonetti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alessandro","surname":"Protti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Langer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Massimo","surname":"Girardis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giacomo","surname":"Bellani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Laffey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gianpaolo","surname":"Carrafiello","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luca","surname":"Carsana","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chiara","surname":"Rizzuto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alberto","surname":"Zanella","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vittorio","surname":"Scaravilli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giacinto","surname":"Pizzilli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Domenico Luca","surname":"Grieco","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Letizia","surname":"Di Meglio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gennaro","surname":"de Pascale","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ezio","surname":"Lanza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francesco","surname":"Monteduro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maurizio","surname":"Zompatori","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claudia","surname":"Filippini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Franco","surname":"Locatelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maurizio","surname":"Cecconi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roberto","surname":"Fumagalli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefano","surname":"Nava","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jean-Louis","surname":"Vincent","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Massimo","surname":"Antonelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Arthur S","surname":"Slutsky","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Pesenti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"V Marco","surname":"Ranieri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alfredo","surname":"Lissoni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Rossi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amedeo","surname":"Guzzardella","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carlo","surname":"Valsecchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fabiana","surname":"Madotto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francesca","surname":"Bevilacqua","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marco","surname":"Di Laudo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lorenzo","surname":"Querci","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carmen","surname":"Seccafico","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Characteristics and outcomes of 21 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Washington state","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 does not lead to a &quot;typical&quot;

The healthcare system suffered from a shortage of ICU beds and oxygenation support devices.\n\n In our Institution, most patients received chest CT at admission, only interpreted visually.\n\n Given the proven value of quantitative CT analysis (QCT) in the setting of ARDS, we tested QCT as an outcome predictor for COVID-19.\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We performed a single-centre retrospective study on COVID-19 patients hospitalised from January 25, 2020, to April 28, 2020, who received CT at admission prompted by respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea or desaturation.\n\n QCT was performed using a semi-automated method (3D Slicer).\n\n Lungs were divided by Hounsfield unit intervals.\n\n Compromised lung (%CL) volume was the sum of poorly and non-aerated volumes (??500, 100 HU).\n\n We collected patient’s clinical data including oxygenation support throughout hospitalisation.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Two hundred twenty-two patients (163 males, median age 66, IQR 54–6) were included; 75% received oxygenation support (20% intubation rate).\n\n Compromised lung volume was the most accurate outcome predictor (logistic regression, p &lt;?0.001).\n\n %CL values in the 6–23% range increased risk of oxygenation support; values above 23% were at risk for intubation.\n\n %CL showed a negative correlation with PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p &lt;?0.001) and was a risk factor for in-hospital mortality (p &lt;?0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>QCT provides new metrics of COVID-19.

COVID-19 are similar to other causes of ARDS","abstract":"Purpose\nid='Par1'>The main characteristics of mechanically ventilated ARDS patients affected with COVID-19, and the adherence to lung-protective ventilation strategies are not well known.\n\n We describe characteristics and outcomes of confirmed ARDS in COVID-19 patients managed with invasive mechanical ventilation (MV).\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study in consecutive, mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS (as defined by the Berlin criteria) affected with with COVID-19 (confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens), admitted to a network of 36 Spanish and Andorran intensive care units (ICUs) between March 12 and June 1, 2020. We examined the clinical features, ventilatory management, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 ARDS patients, and compared some results with other relevant studies in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>A total of 742 patients were analysed with complete 28-day outcome data: 128 (17.1%) with mild, 331 (44.6%) with moderate, and 283 (38.1%) with severe ARDS.\n\n At baseline, defined as the first day on invasive MV, median (IQR) values were: tidal volume 6.9 (6.3–7.8) ml/kg predicted body weight, positive end-expiratory pressure 12 (11–14) cmH2O.\n\n Values of respiratory system compliance 35 (27–45) ml/cmH2O, plateau pressure 25 (22–29) cmH2O, and driving pressure 12 (10–16) cmH2O were similar to values from non-COVID-19 ARDS patients observed in other studies.\n\n Recruitment maneuvers, prone position and neuromuscular blocking agents were used in 79%, 76% and 72% of patients, respectively.\n\n The risk of 28-day mortality was lower in mild ARDS [hazard ratio (RR) 0.56 (95% CI 0.33–0.93), p?=?0.026] and moderate ARDS [hazard ratio (RR) 0.69 (95% CI 0.47–0.97), p?=?0.035] when compared to severe ARDS.\n\n The 28-day mortality was similar to other observational studies in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>In this large series, COVID-19 ARDS patients have features similar to other causes of ARDS, compliance with lung-protective ventilation was high, and the risk of 28-day mortality increased with the degree of ARDS severity.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

respiratory distress syndrome associated with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nPatients with COVID-19 who develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can have symptoms that rapidly evolve to profound hypoxaemia and death.\n\n The efficacy of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with severe ARDS in the context of COVID-19 is unclear.\n\n We aimed to establish the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with respiratory failure and COVID-19 treated with ECMO.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective cohort study was done in the Paris–Sorbonne University Hospital Network, comprising five intensive care units (ICUs) and included patients who received ECMO for COVID-19 associated ARDS.\n\n Patient demographics and daily pre-ECMO and on-ECMO data and outcomes were collected.\n\n Possible outcomes over time were categorised into four different states (states 1–4): on ECMO, in the ICU and weaned off ECMO, alive and out of ICU, or death.\n\n Daily probabilities of occupation in each state and of transitions between these states until day 90 post-ECMO onset were estimated with use of a multi-state Cox model stratified for each possible transition.\n\n Follow-up was right-censored on July 10, 2020.\nFindings\nFrom March 8 to May 2, 2020, 492 patients with COVID-19 were treated in our ICUs.\n\n Complete day-60 follow-up was available for 83 patients (median age 49 [IQR 41–56] years and 61 [73%] men) who received ECMO.\n\n Pre-ECMO, 78 (94%) patients had been prone-positioned; their median driving pressure was 18 (IQR 16–21) cm H2O and PaO2/FiO2 was 60 (54–68) mm Hg.\n\n At 60 days post-ECMO initiation, the estimated probabilities of occupation in each state were 6% (95% CI 3–14) for state 1, 18% (11–28) for state 2, 45% (35–56) for state 3, and 31% (22–42) for state 4. 35 (42%) patients had major bleeding and four (5%) had a haemorrhagic stroke.\n\n 30 patients died.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe estimated 60-day survival of ECMO-rescued patients with COVID-19 was similar to that of studies published in the past 2 years on ECMO for severe ARDS.\n\n If another COVID-19 outbreak occurs, ECMO should be considered for patients developing refractory respiratory failure despite optimised care.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7426089","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

outcome of ARDS caused by COVID-19 are similar to other causes of ARDS","abstract":"Purpose\nid='Par1'>The main characteristics of mechanically ventilated ARDS patients affected with COVID-19, and the adherence to lung-protective ventilation strategies are not well known.\n\n We describe characteristics and outcomes of confirmed ARDS in COVID-19 patients managed with invasive mechanical ventilation (MV).\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study in consecutive, mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS (as defined by the Berlin criteria) affected with with COVID-19 (confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens), admitted to a network of 36 Spanish and Andorran intensive care units (ICUs) between March 12 and June 1, 2020. We examined the clinical features, ventilatory management, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 ARDS patients, and compared some results with other relevant studies in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>A total of 742 patients were analysed with complete 28-day outcome data: 128 (17.1%) with mild, 331 (44.6%) with moderate, and 283 (38.1%) with severe ARDS.\n\n At baseline, defined as the first day on invasive MV, median (IQR) values were: tidal volume 6.9 (6.3–7.8) ml/kg predicted body weight, positive end-expiratory pressure 12 (11–14) cmH2O.\n\n Values of respiratory system compliance 35 (27–45) ml/cmH2O, plateau pressure 25 (22–29) cmH2O, and driving pressure 12 (10–16) cmH2O were similar to values from non-COVID-19 ARDS patients observed in other studies.\n\n Recruitment maneuvers, prone position and neuromuscular blocking agents were used in 79%, 76% and 72% of patients, respectively.\n\n The risk of 28-day mortality was lower in mild ARDS [hazard ratio (RR) 0.56 (95% CI 0.33–0.93), p?=?0.026] and moderate ARDS [hazard ratio (RR) 0.69 (95% CI 0.47–0.97), p?=?0.035] when compared to severe ARDS.\n\n The 28-day mortality was similar to other observational studies in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>In this large series, COVID-19 ARDS patients have features similar to other causes of ARDS, compliance with lung-protective ventilation was high, and the risk of 28-day mortality increased with the degree of ARDS severity.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P&lt;0.001).\n\n The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization.\n\n In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs.\n\n 41.4%;

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death

injury in patients with COVID-19: A multinational study using the ISARIC–WHO clinical characterisation protocol","abstract":"Background\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common and significant problems in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n However, little is known about the incidence and impact of AKI occurring in the community or early in the hospital admission.\n\n The traditional Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition can fail to identify patients for whom hospitalisation coincides with recovery of AKI as manifested by a decrease in serum creatinine (sCr).\n\n We hypothesised that an extended KDIGO (eKDIGO) definition, adapted from the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) 0by25 studies, would identify more cases of AKI in patients with COVID-19 and that these may correspond to community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI) with similarly poor outcomes as previously reported in this population.\n\n\nMethods and findings\nAll individuals recruited using the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC)–World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol (CCP) and admitted to 1,609 hospitals in 54 countries with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from February 15, 2020 to February 1, 2021 were included in the study.\n\n Data were collected and analysed for the duration of a patient’s admission.\n\n Incidence, staging, and timing of AKI were evaluated using a traditional and eKDIGO definition, which incorporated a commensurate decrease in sCr.\n\n Patients within eKDIGO diagnosed with AKI by a decrease in sCr were labelled as deKDIGO.\n\n Clinical characteristics and outcomes—intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital death—were compared for all 3 groups of patients.\n\n The relationship between eKDIGO AKI and in-hospital death was assessed using survival curves and logistic regression, adjusting for disease severity and AKI susceptibility.\n\n A total of 75,670 patients were included in the final analysis cohort.\n\n Median length of admission was 12 days (interquartile range [IQR] 7, 20).\n\n There were twice as many patients with AKI identified by eKDIGO than KDIGO (31.7% versus 16.8%).\n\n Those in the eKDIGO group had a greater proportion of stage 1 AKI (58% versus 36% in KDIGO patients).\n\n Peak AKI occurred early in the admission more frequently among eKDIGO than KDIGO patients.\n\n Compared to those without AKI, patients in the eKDIGO group had worse renal function on admission, more in-hospital complications, higher rates of ICU admission (54% versus 23%) invasive ventilation (45% versus 15%), and increased mortality (38% versus 19%).\n\n Patients in the eKDIGO group had a higher risk of in-hospital death than those without AKI (adjusted odds ratio: 1.78, 95% confidence interval: 1.71 to 1.80, p-value &lt; 0.001).\n\n Mortality and rate of ICU admission were lower among deKDIGO than KDIGO patients (25% versus 50% death and 35% versus 70% ICU admission) but significantly higher when compared to patients with no AKI (25% versus 19% death and 35% versus 23% ICU admission) (all p-values &lt;5 × 10?5).\n\n Limitations include ad hoc sCr sampling, exclusion of patients with less than two sCr measurements, and limited availability of sCr measurements prior to initiation of acute dialysis.\n\n\nConclusions\nAn extended KDIGO definition of AKI resulted in a significantly higher detection rate in this population.\n\n These additional cases of AKI occurred early in the hospital admission and were associated with worse outcomes compared to patients without AKI.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9067700","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

patient-days.\n\n Incidence rates of in-hospital death among patients without AKI, with AKI not requiring dialysis (AKI stages 1-3), and with AKI receiving dialysis (AKI 3D) were 10.8, 31.1, and 37.5/1,000 patient-days, respectively.\n\n Taking those without AKI as the reference group, we observed greater risks for in-hospital death for patients with AKI 1-3 and AKI 3D (HRs of 5.6 [95% CI, 5.0-6.3] and 11.3 [95% CI, 9.6-13.1], respectively).\n\n After adjusting for demographics, comorbid conditions, and illness severity, the risk for death remained higher among those with AKI 1-3 (adjusted HR, 3.4 [95% CI, 3.0-3.9]) and AKI 3D (adjusted HR, 6.4 [95% CI, 5.5-7.6]) compared with those without AKI.\n\n Among patients with AKI 1-3 who survived, 74.1% achieved kidney recovery by the time of discharge.\n\n Among those with AKI 3D who survived, 30.6% remained on dialysis at discharge, and prehospitalization chronic kidney disease was the only independent risk factor associated with needing dialysis at discharge (adjusted OR, 9.3 [95% CI, 2.3-37.8]).\n\n\nLimitations\nObservational retrospective study, limited to the NY metropolitan area during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nAKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was associated with significant risk for death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7833189","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"by the

disease is associated with in-hospital death of patients with COVID-19","abstract":"In December 2019, a coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease outbreak occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread to other areas worldwide.\n Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure were the main features, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored.\n Since information on kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 is limited, we determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19. Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital that also encompassed three affiliates following this major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020 of whom 113 (16.1%) died in hospital.\n Median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range, 50-71), including 367 men and 334 women.\n On admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria.\n The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively.\n During the study period, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients.\n Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death.\n Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1+ (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2+?3+ (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1+ (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2+?3+ (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count.\n Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality.\n Hence, clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe COVID-19.","id":"PMC7110296","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International Society of Nephrology.

and management of community-acquired acute kidney injury in low-resource settings in the ISN 0by25 trial: A multi-country feasibility study","abstract":"Background\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly encountered in community settings and contributes to morbidity, mortality, and increased resource utilization worldwide.\n\n In low-resource settings, lack of awareness of and limited access to diagnostic and therapeutic interventions likely influence patient management.\n\n We evaluated the feasibility of the use of point-of-care (POC) serum creatinine and urine dipstick testing with an education and training program to optimize the identification and management of AKI in the community in 3 low-resource countries.\n\n\nMethods and findings\nPatients presenting to healthcare centers (HCCs) from 1 October 2016 to 29 September 2017 in the cities Cochabamba, Bolivia; Dharan, Nepal; and Blantyre, Malawi, were assessed utilizing a symptom-based risk score to identify patients at moderate to high AKI risk.\n\n POC testing for serum creatinine and urine dipstick at enrollment were utilized to classify these patients as having chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney disease (AKD), or no kidney disease (NKD).\n\n Patients were followed for a maximum of 6 months with repeat POC testing.\n\n AKI development was assessed at 7 days, kidney recovery at 1 month, and progression to CKD and mortality at 3 and 6 months.\n\n Following an observation phase to establish baseline data, care providers and physicians in the HCCs were trained with a standardized protocol utilizing POC tests to evaluate and manage patients, guided by physicians in referral hospitals connected via mobile digital technology.\n\n We evaluated 3,577 patients, and 2,101 were enrolled: 978 in the observation phase and 1,123 in the intervention phase.\n\n Due to the high number of patients attending the centers daily, it was not feasible to screen all patients to assess the actual incidence of AKI.\n\n Of enrolled patients, 1,825/2,101 (87%) were adults, 1,117/2,101 (53%) were females, 399/2,101 (19%) were from Bolivia, 813/2,101 (39%) were from Malawi, and 889/2,101 (42%) were from Nepal.\n\n The age of enrolled patients ranged from 1 month to 96 years, with a mean of 43 years (SD 21) and a median of 43 years (IQR 27–62).\n\n Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (418/2,101; 20%).\n\n At enrollment, 197/2,101 (9.4%) had CKD, and 1,199/2,101 (57%) had AKD.\n\n AKI developed in 30% within 7 days.\n\n By 1 month, 268/978 (27%) patients in the observation phase and 203/1,123 (18%) in the intervention phase were lost to follow-up.\n\n In the intervention phase, more patients received fluids (observation 714/978 [73%] versus intervention 874/1,123 [78%]; 95% CI 0.63, 0.94; p = 0.012), hospitalization was reduced (observation 578/978 [59%] versus intervention 548/1,123 [49%]; 95% CI 0.55, 0.79; p &lt; 0.001), and admitted patients with severe AKI did not show a significantly lower mortality during follow-up (observation 27/135 [20%] versus intervention 21/178 [11.8%]; 95% CI 0.98, 3.52; p = 0.057).\n\n Of 504 patients with kidney function assessed during the 6-month follow-up, de novo CKD arose in 79/484 (16.3%), with no difference between the observation and intervention phase (95% CI 0.91, 2.47; p = 0.101).\n\n Overall mortality was 273/2,101 (13%) and was highest in those who had CKD (24/106; 23%), followed by those with AKD (128/760; 17%), AKI (85/628; 14%), and NKD (36/607; 6%).\n\n The main limitation of our study was the inability to determine the actual incidence of kidney dysfunction in the health centers as it was not feasible to screen all the patients due to the high numbers seen daily.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis multicenter, non-randomized feasibility study in low-resource settings demonstrates that it is feasible to implement a comprehensive program utilizing POC testing and protocol-based management to improve the recognition and management of AKI and AKD in high-risk patients in primary care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7808595","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

pragmatic recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of patients with COVID-19 and AKI in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).\n For the prevention of AKI among patients with COVID-19 in LMICs, we recommend using isotonic crystalloid solutions for expansion of intravascular volume, avoiding nephrotoxic medications, and using a conservative fluid management strategy in patients with respiratory failure.\n For the diagnosis of AKI, we suggest that any patient with COVID-19 presenting with an elevated serum creatinine level without available historical values be considered as having AKI.\n If serum creatinine testing is not available, we suggest that patients with proteinuria should be considered to have possible AKI.\n We suggest expansion of the use of point-of-care serum creatinine and salivary urea nitrogen testing in community health settings, as funding and availability allow.\n For the management of patients with AKI and COVID-19 in LMICS, we recommend judicious use of intravenous fluid resuscitation.\n For patients requiring dialysis who do not have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we suggest using peritoneal dialysis (PD) as first choice, where available and feasible.\n For patients requiring dialysis who do have ARDS, we suggest using hemodialysis, where available and feasible, to optimize fluid removal.\n We suggest

pandemic has affected the care of vulnerable chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients across regions, particularly in low and lower-middle income countries (LLMICs).\n\n We aimed to identify global inequities in HD care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nMethods\nThe ISN and the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) conducted a global online survey of HD units between March and November, 2020, to ascertain practice patterns and access to resources relevant to HD care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Responses were categorized according to World Bank income classification for comparisons.\n\n\nResults\nSurveys were returned from 412 facilities in 78 countries: 15 (4%) in low-income countries (LICs), 111 (27%) in lower-middle income countries (LMICs), 145 (35%) in upper-middle income countries (UMICs), and 141 (34%) in high-income countries (HICs).\n\n Respondents reported that diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 were unavailable or of limited availability in LICs (72%) and LMICs (68%) as compared with UMICs (33%) and HICs (20%).\n\n The number of patients who missed HD treatments was reported to have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in LICs (64%) and LMICs (67%) as compared with UMICs (31%) and HICs (6%).\n\n Limited access to HD, intensive care unit (ICU) care, and mechanical ventilation among hospitalized patients on chronic dialysis with COVID-19 were also reportedly higher in LICs and LMICs as compared with UMICs and HICs.\n\n Staff in LLMICs reported less routine testing for SARS-CoV-2 when asymptomatic as compared with UMICs and HICs—14% in LICs and 11% in LMICs, compared with 26% and 28% in UMICs and HICs, respectively.\n\n Severe shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) were reported by the respondents from LICs and LMICs compared with UMICs and HICs, especially with respect to the use of the N95 particulate-air respirator masks.\n\n\nConclusion\nStriking global inequities were identified in the care of chronic HD patients during the pandemic.\n\n Urgent action is required to address these inequities which disproportionately affect LLMIC settings thereby exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities that may

review, meta-analysis and public policy implications","abstract":"Introduction\nThe infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19 has been carefully measured and analysed in high-income countries, whereas there has been no systematic analysis of age-specific seroprevalence or IFR for developing countries.\n\n\nMethods\nWe systematically reviewed the literature to identify all COVID-19 serology studies in developing countries that were conducted using representative samples collected by February 2021. For each of the antibody assays used in these serology studies, we identified data on assay characteristics, including the extent of seroreversion over time.\n\n We analysed the serology data using a Bayesian model that incorporates conventional sampling uncertainty as well as uncertainties about assay sensitivity and specificity.\n\n We then calculated IFRs using individual case reports or aggregated public health updates, including age-specific estimates whenever feasible.\n\n\nResults\nIn most locations in developing countries, seroprevalence among older adults was similar to that of younger age cohorts, underscoring the limited capacity that these nations have to protect older age groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe burden of COVID-19 is far higher in developing countries than in high-income countries, reflecting a combination of elevated transmission to middle-aged and older adults as well as limited access to adequate healthcare.\n\n These results underscore the critical need to ensure medical equity to populations in developing countries through provision of vaccine doses and effective medications.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9136695","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Andrew

how socioeconomic inequalities drive inequalities in COVID-19 infections","abstract":"id='Par1'>Across the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected economically disadvantaged groups.\n This differential impact has numerous possible explanations, each with significantly different policy implications.\n We examine, for the first time in a low- or middle-income country, which mechanisms best explain the disproportionate impact of the virus on the poor.\n Combining an epidemiological model with rich data from Bogotá, Colombia, we show that total infections and inequalities in infections are largely driven by inequalities in the ability to work remotely and in within-home secondary attack rates.\n Inequalities in isolation behavior are less important but non-negligible, while access to testing and contract-tracing plays practically no role because it is too slow to contain the virus.\n Interventions that mitigate transmission are often more effective when targeted on

600?000 hospitalized patients with COVID-19","abstract":"Background\nWe describe demographic features, treatments and clinical outcomes in the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) COVID-19 cohort, one of the world's largest international, standardized data sets concerning hospitalized patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThe data set analysed includes COVID-19 patients hospitalized between January 2020 and January 2022 in 52 countries.\n\n We investigated how symptoms on admission, co-morbidities, risk factors and treatments varied by age, sex and other characteristics.\n\n We used Cox regression models to investigate associations between demographics, symptoms, co-morbidities and other factors with risk of death, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).\n\n\nResults\nData were available for 689?572 patients with laboratory-confirmed (91.1%) or clinically diagnosed (8.9%) SARS-CoV-2 infection from 52 countries.\n\n Age [adjusted hazard ratio per 10?years 1.49 (95% CI 1.48, 1.49)] and male sex [1.23 (1.21, 1.24)] were associated with a higher risk of death.\n\n Rates of admission to an ICU and use of IMV increased with age up to age 60 years then dropped.\n\n Symptoms, co-morbidities and treatments varied by age and had varied associations with clinical outcomes.\n\n The case-fatality ratio varied by country partly due to differences in the clinical characteristics of recruited patients and was on average 21.5%.\n\n\nConclusions\nAge was the strongest determinant of risk of death, with a ?30-fold difference between the oldest and youngest groups; each of the co-morbidities included was associated with up to an almost 2-fold increase in risk.\n\n Smoking and obesity were also associated with a higher risk of death.\n\n The size of our international database and the standardized data collection method make this study a comprehensive international description of COVID-19 clinical features.\n\n Our findings may inform strategies that involve prioritization of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who have a higher risk of death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC10114094","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

We also calculated the posterior probability of meeting the global diabetes target if post-2000 trends continue.\n\n\nFindings\nWe used data from 751 studies including 4?372?000 adults from 146 of the 200 countries we make estimates for.\n\n Global age-standardised diabetes prevalence increased from 4·3% (95% credible interval 2·4–7·0) in 1980 to 9·0% (7·2–11·1) in 2014 in men, and from 5·0% (2·9–7·9) to 7·9% (6·4–9·7) in women.\n\n The number of adults with diabetes in the world increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 (28·5% due to the rise in prevalence, 39·7% due to population growth and ageing, and 31·8% due to interaction of these two factors).\n\n Age-standardised adult diabetes prevalence in 2014 was lowest in northwestern Europe, and highest in Polynesia and Micronesia, at nearly 25%, followed by Melanesia and the Middle East and north Africa.\n\n Between 1980 and 2014 there was little change in age-standardised diabetes prevalence in adult women in continental western Europe, although crude prevalence rose because of ageing of the population.\n\n By contrast, age-standardised adult prevalence rose by 15 percentage points in men and women in Polynesia and Micronesia.\n\n In 2014, American Samoa had the highest national prevalence of diabetes (&gt;30% in both sexes), with age-standardised adult prevalence also higher than 25% in some other islands in Polynesia and Micronesia.\n\n If post-2000 trends continue, the probability of meeting the global target of halting the rise in the prevalence of diabetes by 2025 at the 2010 level worldwide is lower than 1% for men and is 1% for women.\n\n Only nine countries for men and 29 countries for women, mostly in western Europe, have a 50% or higher probability of meeting the global target.\n\n\nInterpretation\nSince 1980, age-standardised diabetes prevalence in adults has increased, or at best remained unchanged, in every country.\n\n Together with population growth and ageing, this rise has led to a near quadrupling of the number of adults with diabetes worldwide.\n\n The burden of diabetes, both in terms of prevalence and number of adults affected, has increased faster in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome

humans.\n Human fat distribution and its metabolic consequences have received extensive attention, but much of what has been tested in translational research has relied heavily on rodents.\n Unfortunately, the validity of using rodent fat pads as a model of human adiposity has received less attention.\n There is a surprisingly lack of studies demonstrating an analogous relationship between rodent and human adiposity on obesity-related comorbidities.\n Therefore, we aimed to compare known similarities and disparities in terms of white adipose tissue (WAT) development and distribution, sexual dimorphism, weight loss, adipokine secretion, and aging.\n While the literature supports the notion that many similarities exist between rodents and humans, notable differences emerge related to fat deposition and function of WAT.\n Thus, further research is warranted to more carefully define the strengths and limitations of rodent WAT as a model for humans, with a particular emphasis on comparable fat depots, such as mesenteric fat.\n","id":"PMC4835715","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniella

can lead to metabolic syndrome.\n This paper reviews mechanisms by which the accumulation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) may contribute to the metabolic syndrome, and explores the paradigm of a critical VAT threshold (CVATT).\n Exceeding the CVATT may result in a number of metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance to glucose uptake by cells.\n Metabolic profiles of patients with visceral obesity may substantially improve after only modest weight loss.\n This could reflect a significant reduction in the amount of VAT relative to peripheral or subcutaneous fat depots, thereby maintaining VAT below the CVATT.\n The CVATT may be unique for each individual.\n This may help explain the phenomena of apparently lean individuals with metabolic syndrome, the so-called metabolically normal weight (MONW), as well as the obese with normal metabolic profiles, i.\ne.\n, metabolically normal obese (MNO), and those who are 'fit and fat.\n' The concept of CVATT may have implications for prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome, which may include controlling dietary carbohydrates.\n The identification of the CVATT is admittedly difficult and its anatomical boundaries are not well-defined.\n Thus, the CVATT will continue to be a work in progress.\n","id":"PMC535537","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

component of the blood vessel wall regulating vascular homeostasis and affecting the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.\n Although PVAT characteristics resemble both brown and white adipose tissues, recent evidence suggests that PVAT develops from its own distinct precursors implying a closer link between PVAT and vascular system.\n Under physiological conditions, PVAT has potent anti-atherogenic properties mediated by its ability to secrete various biologically active factors that induce non-shivering thermogenesis and metabolize fatty acids.\n In contrast, under pathological conditions (mainly obesity), PVAT becomes dysfunctional, loses its thermogenic capacity and secretes pro-inflammatory adipokines that induce endothelial dysfunction and infiltration of inflammatory cells, promoting atherosclerosis development.\n Since PVAT plays crucial roles in regulating key steps of atherosclerosis development, it may constitute a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.\n Here, we review the current literature regarding the roles of PVAT in the pathogenesis of

that primarily functions as a fat reservoir.\n For this reason, adipose tissue is considered as the primary site for initiation and aggravation of obesity and T2DM.\n As a key endocrine organ, the adipose tissue communicates with other organs, such as the brain, liver, muscle, and pancreas, for the maintenance of energy homeostasis.\n Two different types of adipose tissues—the white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT)—secrete bioactive peptides and proteins, known as “adipokines” and “batokines,” respectively.\n Some of them have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, while others have harmful inflammatory effects.\n Recently, “exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs)” were identified as novel adipokines, as adipose tissue-derived exosomal miRNAs can affect other organs.\n In the present review, we discuss the role of adipose-derived secretory factors—adipokines, batokines, and exosomal miRNA—in obesity and T2DM.\n It will provide new insights into the pathophysiological

the postnatal stage in response to chronic cold or PPAR? agonists.\n Beige cells’ inducible characteristics make them a promising therapeutic target for obesity treatment, however, the relevance of

nearly all the human BAT abundantly expressed beige cell-selective genes, but the expression of classical brown fat-selective genes were nearly undetectable.\n Interestingly, expression of known brown fat-selective genes such as PRDM16 was strongly correlated with that of the newly identified beige cell-selective genes, but not with that of classical brown fat-selective genes.\n Furthermore,

remediation of type-2 diabetes; however, the mechanisms leading to these improvements are unclear.\n\n Additionally, adipocytes within white adipose tissue (WAT) depots can manifest characteristics of brown adipocytes.\n\n These ‘BRITE/beige’ adipocytes express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and are associated with improvements in glucose homeostasis and protection from obesity.\n\n Interestingly, atrial and B-type natriuretic peptides (NPs) promote BRITE/beige adipocyte enrichment of WAT depots, an effect known as “browning.\n\n” Here, we investigate the effect of RYGB surgery on NP, NP receptors, and browning in the gonadal adipose tissues of female mice.\n\n We propose that such changes may lead to improvements in metabolic homeostasis commonly observed following RYGB.\n\n\nMethods\nWild type, female, C57/Bl6 mice were fed a 60% fat diet ad libitum for six months.\n\n Mice were divided into three groups: Sham operated (SO), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and Weight matched, sham operated (WM-SO).\n\n Mice were sacrificed six weeks following surgery and evaluated for differences in body weight, glucose homeostasis, adipocyte morphology, and adipose tissue

Npr2, and ?3-adrenergic receptors in gonadal adipose tissue following RYGB was associated with increased markers of browning.\n\n This browning of gonadal adipose tissue may underpin the positive

linoleic acid (10,12 CLA) promotes fat loss in obese mice and humans, but has also been associated with insulin resistance.\n\n\nObjective\nWe therefore sought to directly compare weight loss by 10,12 CLA versus caloric restriction (CR, 15–25%), an acceptable healthy method of weight loss, to determine how 10,12 CLA-mediated weight loss fails to improve glucose metabolism.\n\n\nMethods\nObese mice with characteristics of human metabolic syndrome were either supplemented with 10,12 CLA or subjected to CR to promote weight loss.\n\n Metabolic endpoints such as energy expenditure, glucose and insulin tolerance testing, and trunk fat distribution were measured.\n\n\nResults\nBy design, 10,12 CLA and CR caused equivalent weight loss, with greater fat loss by 10,12 CLA accompanied by increased energy expenditure, reduced respiratory quotient, increased fat oxidation, accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages, and browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT).\n\n Moreover, 10,12 CLA-supplemented mice better defended their body temperature against a cold challenge.\n\n However, 10,12 CLA concurrently induced the detrimental loss of subcutaneous WAT without reducing visceral WAT, promoted reduced plasma and WAT adipokine levels, worsened hepatic steatosis, and failed to improve glucose metabolism.\n\n Obese mice undergoing CR were protected from subcutaneous-specific fat loss, had improved hepatic steatosis, and subsequently showed the expected improvements in WAT adipokines, glucose metabolism and WAT inflammation.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results suggest that 10,12 CLA mediates the preferential loss of subcutaneous fat that likely contributes to hepatic steatosis and maintained insulin resistance, despite significant weight loss and WAT browning in mice.\n\n Collectively, we have shown that weight loss due to 10,12 CLA supplementation or CR results in dramatically different metabolic phenotypes, with the latter promoting a healthier form of weight loss.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5330530","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura J.","surname":"den

decreases in cell size and lipid content and increases in mitochondrial proteins.\n In this article, we discuss recent studies that have investigated the effects of exercise training on mitochondrial function, the “beiging” of WAT, regulation of adipokines, metabolic effects of trained adipose tissue on systemic metabolism, and depot-specific responses to exercise training.\n The major WAT depots in the body are found in the visceral cavity (vWAT) and subcutaneously (scWAT).\n In rodent models, exercise training increases mitochondrial biogenesis and activity in both these adipose tissue depots.\n Exercise training also increases expression of the brown adipocyte marker uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in both adipose tissue depots, although these effects are much more pronounced in scWAT.\n Consistent with the increase in UCP1, exercise training increases the presence of brown-like adipocytes in scWAT, also known as browning or beiging.\n Training results in changes in the gene expression of thousands of scWAT genes and an altered adipokine profile in both scWAT and vWAT.\n Transplantation of trained scWAT in sedentary recipient mice results in striking improvements in skeletal muscle glucose uptake and whole-body metabolic homeostasis.\n Human and rodent exercise studies have indicated that exercise training can alter circulating adipokine concentration as well as adipokine expression in adipose tissue.\n Thus, the profound changes to WAT in response to exercise training may be part of the mechanism by which exercise improves whole-body metabolic

overall, they correlated significantly with BMI (r = 0.406, P = .\n010) and waist circumference (r = 0.516, P = .\n003), but not with fasting insulin levels or HOMA-IR.\n Resistin mRNA expression is increased in PBMC from DM2 women, together with increased expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1?, TNF-?, and IL-6, independent of obesity.\n These results suggest that resistin and cytokines might contribute to the low-grade inflammation and the increased atherogenic risk observed in these patients.\n","id":"PMC2606019","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi Publishing

by excess accumulation of lipids in adipose tissue and other organs, and chronic inflammation associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.\n Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases are major health concerns.\n Resistin was first discovered as an adipose-secreted hormone (adipokine) linked to obesity and insulin resistance in rodents.\n Adipocyte-derived resistin is increased in obese rodents and strongly related to insulin resistance.\n However, in contrast to rodents, resistin is expressed and secreted from macrophages in humans and is increased in inflammatory conditions.\n Some studies have also suggested an association between increased resistin levels and insulin resistance, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n Genetic studies have provided additional evidence for a role of resistin in insulin resistance and inflammation.\n Resistin appears to mediate the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by promoting endothelial dysfunction, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, arterial inflammation, and formation of foam cells.\n Indeed, resistin is predictive of atherosclerosis and poor clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke.\n There is also growing evidence that elevated resistin is associated with the development of heart failure.\n This review will focus on the biology of resistin in rodents and humans, and evidence linking resistin with type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular

adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, increased inflammation, impaired extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis together with an altered secretion of adipokines.\n This review describes the

effects on obesity and diabetes.\n\n In humans, thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) was recently suggested as a source of FGF21 secretion during cold exposure.\n\n Here, we aim to clarify the role of UCP1 and ambient temperature in the regulation of FGF21 in mice.\n\n\nMethods\nWildtype (WT) and UCP1-knockout (UCP1 KO) mice, the latter being devoid of BAT-derived non-shivering thermogenesis, were exposed to different housing temperatures.\n\n Plasma metabolites and FGF21 levels were determined, gene expression was analyzed by qPCR, and tissue histology was performed with adipose tissue.\n\n\nResults\nAt thermoneutrality, FGF21 gene expression and serum levels were not different between WT and UCP1 KO mice.\n\n Cold exposure led to highly increased FGF21 serum levels in UCP1 KO mice, which were reflected in increased FGF21 gene expression in adipose tissues but not in liver and skeletal muscle.\n\n Ex vivo secretion assays revealed FGF21 release only from BAT, progressively increasing with decreasing ambient temperatures.\n\n In association with increased FGF21 serum levels in the UCP1 KO mouse, typical FGF21-related serum metabolites and inguinal white

removal of adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis renders BAT a significant source of endogenous FGF21 under thermal stress.\n\n Thus, the thermogenic competence of BAT is not a requirement for FGF21

risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\n However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that link obesity to chronic inflammation and CVD are poorly understood.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nAcute-phase serum amyloid A (A-SAA) mRNA levels, and A-SAA adipose secretion and serum levels were measured in obese and nonobese individuals, obese participants who underwent weight-loss, and persons treated with the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone.\n\n Inflammation-eliciting activity of A-SAA was investigated in human adipose stromal vascular cells, coronary vascular endothelial cells and a murine monocyte cell line.\n\n We demonstrate that A-SAA was highly and selectively expressed in human adipocytes.\n\n Moreover, A-SAA mRNA levels and A-SAA secretion from adipose tissue were significantly correlated with body mass index (\nr = 0.47;\np = 0.028 and\nr = 0.80;\np = 0.0002, respectively).\n\n Serum A-SAA levels decreased significantly after weight loss in obese participants (\np = 0.006), as well as in those treated with rosiglitazone (\np = 0.033).\n\n The magnitude of the improvement in insulin sensitivity after weight loss was significantly correlated with decreases in serum A-SAA (\nr = ?0.74;\np = 0.034).\n\n SAA treatment of vascular endothelial cells and monocytes markedly increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, e.\n\ng.\n\n,

In addition, SAA increased basal lipolysis in adipose tissue culture by 47%.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nA-SAA is a proinflammatory and lipolytic adipokine in humans.\n\n The increased expression of A-SAA by adipocytes in obesity suggests that it may play a critical role in local and systemic inflammation and free fatty acid production and could be a direct link between obesity and its comorbidities, such as insulin resistance and atherosclerosis.\n\n Accordingly, improvements in systemic inflammation and insulin resistance with weight loss and rosiglitazone therapy may in part be mediated by decreases

baseline survey of a cohort study in Tokushima Prefecture, Japan.\n\n Systemic inflammation level was assessed by serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and the degree of insulin

as a body mass index (BMI) of 23.0–24.9 kg/m2 and ?25.0 kg/m2, respectively.\n\n Associations between serum hs-CRP (assessed as quartiles and additionally continuous values after log-transformation)

recently correlated with obesity and insulin resistance.\n\n Therefore, we first examined whether human recombinant SAA (rSAA) could affect the proliferation, differentiation and metabolism of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.\n\n\nDESIGN:\nPreadipocytes were treated with rSAA and analyzed for changes in viability and [3H-methyl]-thymidine incorporation as well as cell cycle perturbations using flow cytometry analysis.\n\n The mRNA expression profiles of adipogenic factors during the differentiation protocol were also analyzed using real-time PCR.\n\n After differentiation, 2-deoxy-[1,2-3H]-glucose uptake and glycerol release were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nrSAA treatment caused a 2.6-fold increase in cell proliferation, which was consistent with the results from flow cytometry showing that rSAA treatment augmented the percentage of cells in the S phase (60.9±0.54%) compared with the control cells (39.8±2.2%, ***\nP&lt;0.001).\n\n The rSAA-induced cell proliferation was mediated by the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which was assessed by pretreatment with the inhibitor PD98059. However, the exposure of 3T3-L1 cells to rSAA during the differentiation process resulted in attenuated adipogenesis and decreased expression of adipogenesis-related factors.\n\n During the first 72?h of differentiation, rSAA inhibited the differentiation process by altering the mRNA expression kinetics of adipogenic transcription factors and proteins, such as PPAR?2 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? 2), C/EBP? (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ?) and GLUT4. rSAA prevented the intracellular accumulation of lipids and, in fully differentiated cells, increased lipolysis and prevented 2-deoxy-[1,2-3H]-glucose uptake, which favors insulin resistance.\n\n Additionally, rSAA stimulated the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor ?, and upregulated SAA3 mRNA expression during adipogenesis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWe showed that rSAA enhanced proliferation and inhibited differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and altered insulin sensitivity in differentiated cells.\n\n These results highlight the complex role of SAA in the adipogenic process and support a direct link between obesity and its co-morbidities such as type II diabetes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3419975","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"F

Generation of Monocyte Adhesion and Chemotactic Factors by Adipocytes","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nObesity is associated with monocyte-macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue.\n\n Previously, we showed that glucose-stimulated production by adipocytes of serum amyloid A (SAA), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and hyaluronan (HA) facilitated monocyte accumulation.\n\n The current objective was to determine how the other major nutrient, free fatty acids (FFAs), affects these molecules and monocyte recruitment by adipocytes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nDifferentiated 3T3-L1, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome adipocytes, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were exposed to various FFAs (250 ?mol/l) in either 5 or 25 mmol/l (high) glucose for evaluation of SAA, MCP-1, and HA regulation in vitro.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSaturated fatty acids (SFAs) such as laurate, myristate, and palmitate increased cellular triglyceride accumulation, SAA, and MCP-1 expression; generated reactive oxygen species (ROS); and increased nuclear factor (NF) ?B translocation in both 5 and 25 mmol/l glucose.\n\n Conversely, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonate, eicosapentaenate, and docosahexaenate (DHA) decreased these events.\n\n Gene expression could be dissociated from triglyceride accumulation.\n\n Although excess glucose increased HA content, SFAs, oleate, and linoleate did not.\n\n Antioxidant treatment repressed glucose- and palmitate-stimulated ROS generation and NF?B translocation and decreased SAA and MCP-1 expression and monocyte chemotaxis.\n\n Silencing toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) markedly reduced SAA and MCP-1 expression in response to palmitate but not glucose.\n\n DHA suppressed NF?B translocation stimulated by both excess glucose and palmitate via a peroxisome prolifterator–activated receptor (PPAR) ?–dependent pathway.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nExcess glucose and SFAs regulate chemotactic factor expression by a mechanism that involves ROS generation, NF?B, and PPAR?, and which is repressed by PUFAs.\n\n Certain SFAs, but not excess glucose, trigger chemotactic factor expression via a TLR4-dependent pathway.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2809975","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Diabetes Association","authors":[{"firstname":"Chang","surname":"Yeop

mice gained less weight on the HFHSC diet compared to Saa3+/+ littermate controls, with no differences in body composition or resting metabolism.\n Female Saa3\n?/? mice, but not males, had reduced HFHSC diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation and macrophage content.\n Both male and female Saa3\n?/? mice had reduced liver Saa1 and Saa2 expression in association with reduced plasma SAA.\n Additionally, female Saa3\n?/? mice, but not males, showed improved plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein profiles, with no changes in glucose metabolism.\n Taken together, these results suggest that the absence of Saa3 attenuates liver-specific SAA (i.\ne.\n, SAA1/2) secretion into plasma and blunts weight gain induced by an obesogenic diet.\n Furthermore, adipose tissue-specific inflammation and macrophage accumulation are attenuated in female Saa3\n?/? mice, suggesting a novel sexually dimorphic role for this protein.\n These results also suggest that Saa3 influences liver-specific SAA1/2 expression, and that SAA3 could play a larger role in the acute phase response than previously thought.\n","id":"PMC4177399","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura J.","surname":"den Hartigh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shari","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Leela","surname":"Goodspeed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yilei","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"Averill","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Savitha","surname":"Subramanian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tomasz","surname":"Wietecha","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kevin D.","surname":"O'Brien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Chait","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"G.

Mechanisms of Ceramide Action on Insulin Signaling","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nCeramide is now recognized as a negative regulator of insulin signaling by impairing protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt activation.\n\n In different cells, two distinct mechanisms have been proposed to mediate ceramide inhibition of PKB/Akt: one involving atypical protein kinase C zeta (PKC?) and the other the protein phosphatase-2 (PP2A).\n\n We hypothesized that ceramide action through PKC? or PP2A might depend on plasma membrane (PM) structural organization and especially on caveolin-enriched domain (CEM) abundance.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe have used different PKC? mutant constructs or the PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid (OKA), to selectively inhibit PKC?- and PP2A-dependent pathways in cells expressing different caveolin-1 levels and evaluated the impact of insulin and ceramide on PKB/Akt activity in different PM subdomains.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough the PKC?-mediated negative effect of ceramide on insulin-stimulated PKB/Akt was dominant in adipocytes, a ceramide action through PP2A outside CEMs, prevented by OKA, was also unraveled.\n\n To test the importance of CEM to direct ceramide action through the PKC? pathway, we treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes devoid of CEMs with ceramide and we saw a shift of the lipid-negative action on PKB/Akt to a PP2A-mediated mechanism.\n\n In fibroblasts with low CEM abundance, the ceramide-activated PP2A pathway dominated, but could be shifted to a ceramide-activated PKC? pathway after caveolin-1 overexpression.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results show that ceramide can switch from a PKC?-dependent mechanism to a PP2A pathway, acting negatively on PKB/Akt, and hence revealing a critical role of CEMs of the PM in this process.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2828662","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Diabetes Association","authors":[{"firstname":"Cédric

a defect that is central to obesity-linked type 2 diabetes, remain inadequate.\n Adiponectin, an abundant adipocyte-secreted factor with a wide-range of biological activities, improves insulin sensitivity in major insulin target tissues, modulates inflammatory responses, and plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy metabolism.\n However, adiponectin as a promising therapeutic

potential crosstalk between the adiponectin and other signaling pathways involved in metabolic regulation.\n Understanding better just why and how adiponectin and its downstream effector molecules

conditions and in response to pathophysiological insult, the contribution of these distinct sources of macrophages varies significantly between tissues.\n Furthermore, while all of these populations

mice without changing bodyweight","abstract":"Background and Purpose\nWe have recently shown that a reduced function of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contributes crucially to obesity?induced vascular dysfunction in mice.\n\n The current study was conducted to test the hypothesis that vascular dysfunction in obesity can be reversed by in vivo improvement of PVAT eNOS activity.\n\n\nExperimental Approach\nMale C57BL/6J mice were fed a high?fat diet (HFD) for 22 weeks to induce obesity.\n\n During the last 4 weeks of HFD feeding, the obese mice were treated p.\n\no.\n\n with the standardized Crataegus extract WS® 1442, which has been shown previously to improve eNOS activity.\n\n\nKey Results\nDiet?induced obesity in mice markedly reduced the vasodilator response of thoracic aorta to acetylcholine in wire myograph experiments.\n\n Strikingly, this vascular dysfunction was only evident in PVAT?containing aorta but not in PVAT?free aorta.\n\n In vivo treatment of obese mice with WS® 1442 had no effect on body weight or epididymal fat mass, but completely restored the vascular function of PVAT?containing aorta.\n\n Feeding a HFD led to a reduced phosphorylation and an enhanced acetylation of PVAT eNOS, both effects were reversed by WS® 1442 treatment.\n\n\nConclusion and Implications\nPVAT plays a key role in vascular dysfunction in diet?induced obese mice.\n\n Not obesity itself, but a PVAT dysfunction is responsible for obesity?induced vascular disorders.\n\n Improving PVAT function by pharmacological means (e.\n\ng.\n\n with WS® 1442) can ameliorate vascular function even without reducing body weight or fat mass.\n\n\nLinked Articles\nThis article is part of a themed section on Molecular

Adipose Tissue as a Relevant Fat Depot for Cardiovascular Risk in Obesity","abstract":"Obesity is associated with increased risk of premature death, morbidity, and mortality from several cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure.\n However, this is not a straightforward relationship.\n Although several studies have substantiated that obesity confers an independent and additive risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death, there is significant variability in these associations, with some lean individuals developing diseases and others remaining healthy despite severe obesity, the so-called metabolically healthy obese.\n Part of this variability has been attributed to the heterogeneity in both the distribution of body fat and the intrinsic properties of adipose tissue depots, including developmental origin, adipogenic and proliferative capacity, glucose and lipid metabolism, hormonal control, thermogenic ability, and vascularization.\n In obesity, these depot-specific differences translate into specific fat distribution patterns, which are closely associated with differential cardiometabolic risks.\n The adventitial fat layer, also known as perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), is of major importance.\n Similar to the visceral adipose tissue, PVAT has a pathophysiological role in CVDs.\n PVAT influences vascular homeostasis by releasing numerous vasoactive factors, cytokines, and adipokines, which can readily target the underlying smooth muscle cell layers, regulating the vascular tone, distribution of blood flow, as well as angiogenesis, inflammatory processes, and redox status.\n In this review, we summarize the current knowledge and discuss the role of PVAT within the scope of adipose tissue as a major contributing factor to obesity-associated cardiovascular risk.\n Relevant clinical studies documenting the relationship between PVAT dysfunction and CVD with a focus on potential mechanisms by which PVAT contributes to obesity-related CVDs are pointed out.\n","id":"PMC5871983","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

mechanisms in adult humans in terms of a brown fat-brain crosstalk, possibly mediated by batokines, factors produced by and secreted from brown fat.\n Batokines also seems to be involved in BAT recruitment by stimulating proliferation and differentiation of brown fat progenitors.\n Increasing human BAT capacity could thus include inducing brown fat biogenesis as well as identifying novel batokines.\n Another attractive approach would be to induce a brown fat phenotype, the so-called brite or beige fat, within the white fat depots.\n In adult humans, white fat tissue transformation into beige has been observed in patients with pheochromocytoma, a norepinephrine-producing tumor.\n Interestingly, human beige fat is predominantly induced in regions that were BAT during early

adiposity syndrome","abstract":"The association of anthropometric (waist circumference) and hemodynamic (blood pressure) changes with abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism has been motivation for a lot of discussions in the last 30 years.\n Nowadays, blood pressure, body mass index/abdominal circumference, glycemia, triglyceridemia, and HDL-cholesterol concentrations are considered in the definition of Metabolic syndrome, referred as Visceral adiposity syndrome (VAS) in the present review.\n However, more than 250 years ago an association between visceral and mediastinal obesity with hypertension, gout, and obstructive apnea had already been recognized.\n Expansion of visceral adipose tissue secondary to chronic over-consumption of calories stimulates the recruitment of macrophages, which assume an inflammatory phenotype and produce cytokines that directly interfere with insulin signaling, resulting in insulin resistance.\n In turn, insulin resistance (IR) manifests itself in various tissues, contributing to the overall phenotype of VAS.\n For example, in white adipose tissue, IR results in lipolysis, increased free fatty acids release and worsening of inflammation, since fatty acids can bind to Toll-like receptors.\n In the liver, IR results in increased hepatic glucose production, contributing to hyperglycemia; in the vascular endothelium and kidney, IR results in vasoconstriction, sodium retention and, consequently, arterial hypertension.\n Other players have been recognized in the development of VAS, such as genetic predisposition, epigenetic factors associated with exposure to an unfavourable intrauterine environment and the gut microbiota.\n More recently, experimental and clinical studies have shown the autonomic nervous system participates in modulating visceral adipose tissue.\n The sympathetic nervous system is related to adipose tissue function and differentiation through beta1, beta2, beta3, alpha1, and alpha2 adrenergic receptors.\n The relation is bidirectional: sympathetic denervation of adipose tissue blocks lipolysis to a variety of lipolytic stimuli and adipose tissue send inputs to the brain.\n An imbalance of sympathetic/parasympathetic and alpha2 adrenergic/beta3 receptor is related to visceral adipose tissue storage and insulin sensitivity.\n Thus, in addition to the well-known factors classically associated with VAS, abnormal autonomic activity also emerges as an important factor regulating white adipose tissue, which highlights complex role of adipose tissue in the VAS.\n","id":"PMC4950710","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Heno

is crucial for the development of classical brown fat, its role in development and function of inducible brown-in-white (brite) adipose tissue is less clear.\n Here we show that insulin deficiency impaired differentiation of brite adipocytes.\n However, adrenergic stimulation almost fully induced the thermogenic program under these settings.\n Although brite differentiation of adipocytes as well as browning of white adipose tissue entailed substantially elevated glucose uptake by adipose tissue, the capacity of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake surprisingly was not higher in the brite state.\n Notably, in line with the insulin-independent stimulation of glucose uptake, our data revealed that brite recruitment results in induction of solute carrier family 2 (GLUT-1) expression in adipocytes and inguinal WAT.\n These results for the first time demonstrate that insulin signaling is neither essential for brite recruitment, nor is it improved in cells or tissues upon

tissue to type 2 diabetes","abstract":"id='Par1'>Mammalian adipose tissue is traditionally categorized into white and brown relating to their function and morphology: while white serves as an energy storage, brown adipose tissue acts as the heat generator maintaining the core body temperature.\n The most recently identified type of fat, beige adipocyte tissue, resembles brown fat by morphology and function but is developmentally more related to white.\n The synthesis of beige fat, so-called browning of white fat, has developed into a topical issue in diabetes and metabolism research.\n This is due to its favorable effect on whole-body energy metabolism and the fact that it can be recruited during adult life.\n Indeed, brown and beige adipose tissues have been demonstrated to play a role in glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism—all factors related to pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.\n Many agents capable of initiating browning have been identified so far and tested widely in humans and animal models including in vitro and in vivo experiments.\n Interestingly, several agents demonstrated to have browning activity are in fact secreted as adipokines from brown and beige fat tissue, suggesting a physiological relevance both in beige adipocyte recruitment processes and in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis.\n The newest findings on agents driving beige fat recruitment, their mechanisms, and implications on type 2 diabetes are discussed in this review.\n","id":"PMC6513802","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer

under thermoneutral conditions and after prolonged (5–8 h) cold exposure (CE).\n The two groups were similar in age, BMI, and adiposity.\n CE significantly increased resting energy expenditure, whole-body glucose disposal, plasma glucose oxidation, and insulin sensitivity in the BAT+ group only.\n These results demonstrate a physiologically significant role of BAT in whole-body energy

two decades, the understanding of adipose tissue has undergone radical change.\n The perception has evolved from an inert energy storage tissue to that of an active endocrine organ.\n Adipose tissue releases a cluster of active molecules named adipokines.\n The severity of obesity-related diseases does not necessarily correlate with the extent of body fat accumulation but is closely related to body fat distribution, particularly to visceral localization.\n There is a distinction between the metabolic function of central obesity (visceral abdominal) and peripheral obesity (subcutaneous) in the production of adipokines.\n Visceral fat accumulation, linked with levels of some adipokines, induces chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders, including glucose intolerance, hyperlipidaemia, and arterial hypertension.\n Together, these conditions contribute to a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, directly associated with the onset of cardiovascular disease.\n If it is well known that adipokines contribute to the inflammatory profile and appetite regulation, this review is novel in synthesising the current state of knowledge of the role of visceral adipose tissue and its secretion of adipokines in cardiovascular risk.\n","id":"PMC6023062","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"SAGE

Cross-Sectional Observational Study","abstract":"Background:\nThe association between visceral obesity and cardiovascular risk has been well described.\n\n Some studies show a proportional relationship between the presence of visceral obesity and epicardial fat.\n\n Measuring the amount of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) can be a novel parameter that is inexpensive and easy to obtain and may be helpful in cardiovascular risk stratification.\n\n However, the relationship between epicardial fat and cardiac function and that between epicardial fat and cardiac risk factors is less well described.\n\n\nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the association between echocardiographic epicardial fat and the morphologic and physiologic changes observed at echocardiography and to evaluate the association between epicardial fat and cardiac risk factors.\n\n A cross-sectional study of 97 echocardiographic studies (females, n = 42) was conducted.\n\n Two groups were identified: epicardial fat ? 5 mm (group I) and &lt;5 mm (group II).\n\n\nResults:\nEpicardial fat &gt;5 mm was associated with LA enlargement, with lower ejection fraction, increased left ventricular mass, and abnormal diastolic function.\n\n On a multivariable regression analysis, all these parameters also correlated individually with EAT thickness independent of age.\n\n Hyperglycemia (DM), systolic hypertension, and lipid parameters for metabolic syndrome showed a trend for positive association, but this was not statistically significant.\n\n The association was not significant even for higher cutoff limits of EAT thickness.\n\n\nConclusion:\nEpicardial fat &gt;5 mm is associated with cardiac abnormalities on echocardiography.\n\n This is a sensitive assessment of body fat distribution, is easily available at echocardiography, and is simple to acquire at no added cost.\n\n Further studies looking at the appropriate cut-off thickness of EAT and the sites of measurement to be used are needed.\n\n Comparison of this simple and inexpensive measure with other measures of obesity, such as waist-hip ratio, body mass index, Dexa scan of visceral fat, and magnetic resonance imaging of visceral, are needed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3089830","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Medknow

vasculature, and it was routinely removed for isolated blood vessel studies.\n In 1991, Soltis and Cassis demonstrated for the first time that PVAT reduced contractions to noradrenaline in rat aorta.\n Since then, an important number of adipocyte-derived factors with physiological and pathophysiological paracrine vasoactive effects have been identified.\n PVAT undergoes structural and functional changes in obesity.\n During early diet-induced obesity, an adaptative overproduction of vasodilator factors occurs in PVAT, probably aimed at protecting vascular function.\n However, in established obesity, PVAT loses its anticontractile properties by an increase of contractile, oxidative, and inflammatory factors, leading to endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease.\n The aim of this review is to focus on PVAT dysfunction mechanisms in obesity.\n","id":"PMC3838835","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria

Apoe?/? and Ldlr?/? mice expresses functional apoE and LDLR.\n BAT activation increases energy expenditure and decreases plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels.\n Mechanistically, we demonstrate that BAT activation enhances the selective uptake of fatty acids from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins into BAT, subsequently accelerating the hepatic clearance of the cholesterol-enriched remnants.\n These effects depend on a functional hepatic apoE-LDLR clearance pathway as BAT activation in Apoe?/? and Ldlr?/? mice does not attenuate hypercholesterolaemia and atherosclerosis.\n We conclude that

Dysregulated Expression of Adipokines in White Adipose Tissue","abstract":"Obesity is recognized as a risk factor for lifestyle-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n White adipose tissue (WAT) is not only a static storage site for energy; it is also a dynamic tissue that is actively involved in metabolic reactions and produces humoral factors, such as leptin and adiponectin, which are collectively referred to as adipokines.\n Additionally, because there is much evidence that obesity-induced inflammatory changes in WAT, which is caused by dysregulated expression of inflammation-related adipokines involving tumor necrosis factor-? and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, contribute to the development of insulin resistance, WAT has attracted special attention as an organ that causes diabetes and other lifestyle-related diseases.\n Exercise training (TR) not only leads to a decrease in WAT mass but also attenuates obesity-induced dysregulated expression of the inflammation-related adipokines in WAT.\n Therefore, TR is widely used as a tool for preventing and improving lifestyle-related diseases.\n This review outlines the impact of TR on the expression and secretory response of adipokines in WAT.\n","id":"PMC3867917","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi Publishing

obesity.\n\n\nSubjects/Methods:\nA computerized search was made using three databases.\n\n The analysis was restricted to studies that examined the effect of exercise interventions on adipokines (adiponectin, leptin, resistin and visfatin) in pediatric obesity (6–18 years old).\n\n Fourteen randomized controlled trials (347 youths) were included.\n\n Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95%

homeostasis remains poorly understood.\n\n The FGF21–adiponectin axis participates in the regulation of glucose metabolism.\n\n Elevated levels of FGF21 and decreased levels of adiponectin in obesity indicate FGF21–adiponectin axis dysfunction.\n\n Hence, we investigated whether exercise could improve the FGF21–adiponectin axis impairment and ameliorate disturbed glucose metabolism in diet-induced obese mice.\n\n\nMethods\nEight-week-old C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to three groups: low-fat diet control group, high-fat diet group and high-fat diet plus exercise group.\n\n Glucose metabolic parameters, the ability of FGF21 to induce adiponectin, FGF21 receptors and co-receptor levels and adipose tissue inflammation were evaluated after 12 weeks of intervention.\n\n\nResults\nExercise training led to reduced levels of fasting blood glucose and insulin, improved glucose tolerance and better insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.\n\n Although serum FGF21 levels were not significantly changed, both total and high-molecular-weight adiponectin concentrations were markedly enhanced by exercise.\n\n Importantly, exercise protected against high-fat diet-induced impaired ability of FGF21 to stimulate adiponectin secretion.\n\n FGF21 co-receptor, ?-klotho, as well as receptors, FGFR1 and FGFR2, were upregulated by exercise.\n\n We also found that exercise inhibited adipose tissue inflammation, which may contribute to the improvement in the FGF21–adiponectin axis impairment.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data indicate exercise protects against high-fat diet-induced FGF21–adiponectin axis impairment, and may thereby exert beneficial effects on glucose

to training-induced improvements in glucose homeostasis, subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) from exercise-trained or sedentary donor mice was transplanted into the visceral cavity of sedentary recipients.\n Remarkably, 9 days post-transplantation, mice receiving scWAT from exercise-trained mice had improved glucose tolerance and enhanced insulin sensitivity compared with mice transplanted

completely reversed if high-fat–fed recipient mice were transplanted with scWAT from exercise-trained mice.\n In additional experiments, voluntary exercise training by wheel running for only 11 days resulted in profound changes in scWAT, including the increased expression of ?1,550 genes involved in numerous cellular functions including metabolism.\n Exercise training causes adaptations to scWAT

Induces White Adipose Tissue Browning Across the Weight Spectrum in Humans","abstract":"While the effect of exercise on white adipose tissue browning and metabolic improvement in rodents is clear, there are few studies in humans with inconclusive results.\n Thus, the aim of the study was to assess whether an exercise intervention promotes subcutaneous adipose tissue browning in humans, and whether this response is associated with metabolic improvement in three groups of individuals defined by body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2).\n Sedentary adult subjects with different BMI were enrolled in a 12-week bicycle-training program (3 times per week, intensity 70–80% HRmax).\n Brown and beige gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue (scWAT) biopsies, and serum glucose, insulin, lipid, adipokine, and myokine levels were compared before and after the exercise intervention.\n Thirty-three non-diabetic subjects (mean age 30.4 ± 4.6 years; 57.57% female; 13 normal weight, 10 overweight and 10 with obesity) completed the exercise intervention.\n Without any significant change in body composition, exercise improved several metabolic parameters, most notably insulin resistance and particularly in the overweight group.\n Circulating adiponectin, apelin, and irisin exercise-induced changes predicted 60% of the insulin sensitivity improvement.\n After exercise UCP1, TBX1, CPT1B scWAT expression significantly increased, along with P2RX5 significant positive staining.\n These changes are compatible with scWAT browning, however, they were not associated with glucose metabolism improvement.\n In conclusion, 12-weeks of exercise training produced brown/beige gene expression changes in abdominal scWAT of non-diabetic individuals with different BMI, which did not contribute to the metabolic improvement.\n However, this result should not be interpreted as a lack of effect of browning on metabolic parameters.\n These findings suggest that a bigger effect is needed and should not preclude the development of more effective strategies of browning.\n Furthermore, exercise-induced changes in adiponectin, apelin, and irisin predicted insulin sensitivity improvement, supporting the important role of adipokines and myokines in metabolism homeostasis.\n","id":"PMC6297830","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

era of target-based drug discovery and its molecular mechanism of action remains an area of vigorous diabetes research.\n An improvement in our understanding of metformin’s molecular targets is likely to enable target-based identification of second-generation drugs with similar properties, a development that has been impossible up to now.\n The notion that 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mediates the anti-hyperglycaemic action of metformin has recently been challenged by genetic loss-of-function studies, thrusting the AMPK-independent effects of the drug into the spotlight for the first time in more than a decade.\n Key AMPK-independent effects of the drug include the mitochondrial actions that have been known for many years and which are still thought to be the primary site of action of metformin.\n Coupled with recent evidence of AMPK-independent effects on the counter-regulatory hormone glucagon, new paradigms of AMPK-independent drug action are beginning to take shape.\n In this review we summarise the recent research developments on the molecular action of metformin.\n","id":"PMC3737434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin

effects of metformin on energy metabolism and visceral fat volume through a possible mechanism of fatty acid oxidation in human subjects and rats","abstract":"Objective\nMetformin is known to have a beneficial effect on body weight and body composition, although the precise mechanism has not been elucidated yet.\n\n The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of metformin on energy metabolism and anthropometric factors in both human subjects and rats.\n\n\nMethods\nIn human studies, metformin (1500mg/day) was administered to 23 healthy subjects and 18 patients with type 2 diabetes for 2 weeks.\n\n Metabolic parameters and energy metabolism were measured during a meal tolerance test in the morning before and after the treatment of metformin.\n\n In animal studies, 13 weeks old SD rats were fed 25–26 g of standard chow only during 12-hours dark phase with either treated by metformin (2.5mg/ml in drinking water) or not for 2 weeks, and metabolic parameters, anthropometric factors and energy metabolism together with expressions related to fat oxidation and adaptive thermogenesis were measured either in fasting or post-prandial state at 15 weeks old.\n\n\nResults\nPost-prandial plasma lactate concentration was significantly increased after the metformin treatment in both healthy subjects and diabetic patients.\n\n Although energy expenditure (EE) did not change, baseline respiratory quotient (RQ) was significantly decreased and post-prandial RQ was significantly increased vice versa following the metformin treatment in both groups.\n\n By the administration of metformin to SD rats for 2 weeks, plasma levels of lactate and pyruvate were significantly increased in both fasting and post-prandial states.\n\n RQ during a fasting state was significantly decreased in metformin-treated rats compared to controls with no effect on EE.\n\n Metformin treatment brought about a significant reduction of visceral fat mass compared to controls accompanied by an up-regulation of fat oxidation-related enzyme in the liver, UCP-1 in the brown adipose tissue and UCP-3 in the skeletal muscle.\n\n\nConclusion\nFrom the results obtained, beneficial effects of metformin on visceral fat reduction has been demonstrated probably through a mechanism for a potential shift of fuel resource into fat oxidation and an upregulation of adaptive thermogenesis independent of an anorexigenic effect of this drug.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5291441","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

study aims to evaluate the net effects of metformin monotherapy (MM) on the all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.\n\n\nMethods\nA retrospective 5-year follow-up cohort study was conducted on Chinese adult patients with T2DM and without any CVD history under public primary care.\n\n Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed to compare the risk of all-cause mortality

mesolimbic nuclei as the core of reward behavior regulation.\n However, the lateral hypothalamus (LH) is also a key reward-control locus in the brain.\n Here we hypothesize that manipulating glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activity selectively in the LH can profoundly affect food reward behavior, ultimately leading to obesity.\n Progressive ratio operant responding for sucrose was examined in male and female rats, following GLP-1R activation and pharmacological or genetic GLP-1R blockade in the LH.\n Ingestive behavior and metabolic parameters, as well as molecular and efferent targets, of the LH GLP-1R activation were also evaluated.\n Food motivation was reduced by activation of LH GLP-1R.\n Conversely, acute pharmacological blockade of LH GLP-1R increased food motivation but only in male rats.\n GLP-1R activation also induced a robust reduction in food intake and body weight.\n Chronic knockdown of LH GLP-1R induced by intraparenchymal delivery of an adeno-associated virus-short hairpin RNA construct was sufficient to markedly and persistently elevate ingestive behavior and body weight and ultimately resulted in a doubling of fat mass in males and females.\n Interestingly, increased food reinforcement was again found only in males.\n Our data identify the LH GLP-1R as an indispensable element of normal food reinforcement, food intake and body weight regulation.\n These findings also show, for we believe the first time, that brain GLP-1R manipulation can result in a robust and chronic body weight gain.\n The broader implications of these findings are that the LH differs between females and males in its ability to control motivated and ingestive behaviors.\n","id":"PMC5984105","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature

risk: focus on incretins","abstract":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is only partially reduced by intensive glycemic control.\n Diabetic dyslipidemia is suggested to be an additional important contributor to CVD risk in T2DM.\n Multiple lipid lowering medications effectively reduce fasting LDL cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations and several of them routinely reduce CVD risk.\n However, in contemporary Western societies the vasculature is commonly exposed to prolonged postprandial hyperlipidemia.\n Metabolism of these postprandial carbohydrates and lipids yields multiple proatherogenic products.\n Even a transient increase in these factors may worsen vascular function and induces impaired endothelial dependent vasodilatation, a predictor of atherosclerosis and future cardiovascular events.\n There is a recent increased appreciation for the role of gut-derived incretin hormones in controlling the postprandial metabolic milieu.\n Incretin-based medications have been developed and are now used to control postprandial hyperglycemia in T2DM.\n Recent data indicate that these medications may also have profound effects on postprandial lipid metabolism and may favorably influence several cardiovascular functions.\n This review discusses (1) the postprandial state with special emphasis on postprandial lipid metabolism and its role in endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk, (2) the ability of incretins to modulate postprandial hyperlipidemia and (3) the potential of incretin-based therapeutic strategies to

pathophysiological cues","abstract":"White adipose tissue (WAT) has key metabolic and endocrine functions and plays a role in regulating energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.\n WAT is characterised by its capacity to adapt and expand in response to surplus energy through processes of adipocyte hypertrophy and/or recruitment and proliferation of precursor cells in combination with vascular and extracellular matrix remodelling.\n However, in the context of sustained obesity, WAT undergoes fibro-inflammation, which compromises its functionality, contributing to increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\n Conversely, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and browning of WAT represent potential therapeutic approaches, since dysfunctional white adipocyte-induced lipid overspill can be halted by BAT/browning-mediated oxidative anti-lipotoxic effects.\n Better understanding of the cellular and molecular pathophysiological mechanisms regulating adipocyte size, number and depot-dependent expansion has become a focus of interest over recent decades.\n Here, we summarise the mechanisms contributing to adipose tissue (AT) plasticity and function including

cholesterol: a meta-analysis of data from 170?000 participants in 26 randomised trials","abstract":"Background\nLowering of LDL cholesterol with standard statin regimens reduces the risk of occlusive vascular events in a wide range of individuals.\n\n We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol with statin therapy.\n\n\nMethods\nWe undertook meta-analyses of individual participant data from randomised trials involving at least 1000 participants and at least 2 years' treatment duration of more versus less intensive statin regimens (five trials; 39?612 individuals; median follow-up 5·1 years) and of statin versus control (21 trials; 129?526 individuals; median follow-up 4·8 years).\n\n For each type of trial, we calculated not only the average risk reduction, but also the average risk reduction per 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction at 1 year after randomisation.\n\n\nFindings\nIn the trials of more versus less intensive statin therapy, the weighted mean further reduction in LDL cholesterol at 1 year was 0·51 mmol/L.\n\n Compared with less intensive regimens, more intensive regimens produced a highly significant 15% (95% CI 11–18; p&lt;0·0001) further reduction in major vascular events, consisting of separately significant reductions in coronary death or non-fatal myocardial infarction of 13% (95% CI 7–19; p&lt;0·0001), in coronary revascularisation of 19% (95% CI 15–24; p&lt;0·0001), and in ischaemic stroke of 16% (95% CI 5–26; p=0·005).\n\n Per 1·0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, these further reductions in risk were similar to the proportional reductions in the trials of statin versus control.\n\n When both types of trial were combined, similar proportional reductions in major vascular events per 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction were found in all types of patient studied (rate ratio [RR] 0·78, 95% CI 0·76–0·80; p&lt;0·0001), including those with LDL cholesterol lower than 2 mmol/L on the less intensive or control regimen.\n\n Across all 26 trials, all-cause mortality was reduced by 10% per 1·0 mmol/L LDL reduction (RR 0·90, 95% CI 0·87–0·93; p&lt;0·0001), largely reflecting significant reductions in deaths due to coronary heart disease (RR 0·80, 99% CI 0·74–0·87; p&lt;0·0001) and other cardiac causes (RR 0·89, 99% CI 0·81–0·98; p=0·002), with no significant effect on deaths due to stroke (RR 0·96, 95% CI 0·84–1·09; p=0·5) or other vascular causes (RR 0·98, 99% CI 0·81–1·18; p=0·8).\n\n No significant effects were observed on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes (RR 0·97, 95% CI 0·92–1·03; p=0·3) or on cancer incidence (RR 1·00, 95% CI 0·96–1·04; p=0·9), even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations.\n\n\nInterpretation\nFurther reductions in LDL cholesterol safely produce definite further reductions in the incidence of heart attack, of revascularisation, and of ischaemic stroke, with each 1·0 mmol/L reduction reducing the annual rate of these major vascular events by just over a fifth.\n\n There was no evidence of any threshold within the cholesterol range studied, suggesting that reduction of LDL cholesterol by 2–3 mmol/L would reduce risk by about 40–50%.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Medical Research Council, British Heart Foundation, European Community Biomed Programme, Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, and

maintaining host homeostasis.\n The consumption of a high-fat (HF) diet has been shown to induce gut dysbiosis and reduce intestinal integrity.\n Recent studies have revealed that dysbiosis contributes to the progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) by promoting two major CVD risk factors—atherosclerosis and hypertension.\n Imbalances in host–microbial interaction impair homeostatic mechanisms that regulate health and can activate multiple pathways leading to CVD risk factor progression.\n Dysbiosis has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis through metabolism-independent and metabolite-dependent pathways.\n This review will illustrate how these pathways contribute to the various stages of atherosclerotic plaque progression.\n In addition, dysbiosis can promote hypertension through vascular fibrosis and an alteration of vascular tone.\n As CVD is the number one cause of death globally, investigating the gut microbiota as a locus of intervention presents a novel and clinically relevant avenue for future research, with vast therapeutic

activity in human serum is associated with the components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in type 1 diabetic patients with various degrees of kidney disease and patients with IgA glomerulonephritis (IgAGN).\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nSerum LPS activity was determined with the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate chromogenic end point assay in type 1 diabetic patients with a normal albumin excretion rate (n = 587), microalbuminuria (n = 144), macroalbuminuria (n = 173); patients with IgAGN (n = 98); and in nondiabetic control subjects (n = 345).\n\n The relationships of the LPS/HDL ratio and MetS-associated variables were evaluated with Pearson correlation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe MetS was more prevalent in type 1 diabetic patients (48%) than in patients with IgAGN (15%).\n\n Diabetic patients with macroalbuminuria had a significantly higher serum LPS/HDL ratio than patients with IgAGN.\n\n In the normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetic group, patients in the highest LPS/HDL quartile were diagnosed as having the MetS three times more frequently than patients in the lowest quartile (69 vs.\n\n 22%; P &lt; 0.001).\n\n High LPS activity was associated with higher serum triglyceride

the epidemic development of the disease.\n\n In addition to evidence showing that a specific gut microbiota characterizes patients with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hepatic steatosis, the mechanisms causal to the disease could be related to the translocation of microbiota from the gut to the tissues, inducing inflammation.\n\n The mechanisms regulating such a process are based on the crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the host immune system.\n\n The hologenome theory of evolution supports this concept and implies that therapeutic strategies aiming to control glycemia should take into account both the gut microbiota and the host immune system.\n\n\nScope of review\nThis review discusses the latest evidence regarding the bidirectional impact of the gut microbiota on host immune system crosstalk for the control of metabolic disease, hyperglycemia, and obesity.\n\n To avoid redundancies with the literature, we will focus our attention on the intestinal immune system, identifying evidence for the generation of novel therapeutic strategies, which could be based on the control of the translocation of gut bacteria to tissues.\n\n Such novel strategies should hamper the role played by gut microbiota dysbiosis on the development of metabolic inflammation.\n\n\nMajor conclusions\nRecent evidence in rodents allows us to conclude that an impaired intestinal immune

microbiota and bile acid interactions with systemic and adipose tissue metabolism in diet-induced weight loss of obese postmenopausal women","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Microbiota and bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract profoundly alter systemic metabolic processes.\n\n In obese subjects, gradual weight loss ameliorates adipose tissue inflammation and related systemic changes.\n\n We assessed how rapid weight loss due to a very low calorie diet (VLCD) affects the fecal microbiome and fecal bile acid composition, and their interactions with the plasma metabolome and subcutaneous adipose tissue inflammation in obesity.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We performed a prospective cohort study of VLCD-induced weight loss of 10% in ten grades 2–3 obese postmenopausal women in a metabolic unit.\n\n Baseline and post weight loss evaluation included fasting plasma analyzed by mass spectrometry, adipose tissue transcription by RNA sequencing, stool 16S rRNA sequencing for fecal microbiota, fecal bile acids by mass spectrometry, and urinary metabolic phenotyping by 1H-NMR spectroscopy.\n\n Outcome measures included mixed model correlations between changes in fecal microbiota and bile acid composition with changes in plasma metabolite and adipose tissue gene expression pathways.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Alterations in the urinary metabolic phenotype following VLCD-induced weight loss were consistent with starvation ketosis, protein sparing, and disruptions to the functional status of the gut microbiota.\n\n We show that the core microbiome was preserved during VLCD-induced weight loss, but with changes in several groups of bacterial taxa with functional implications.\n\n UniFrac analysis showed overall parallel shifts in community structure, corresponding to reduced abundance of the genus Roseburia and increased Christensenellaceae;g__ (unknown genus).\n\n Imputed microbial functions showed changes in fat and carbohydrate metabolism.\n\n A significant fall in fecal total bile acid concentration and reduced deconjugation and 7-?-dihydroxylation were accompanied by significant changes in several bacterial taxa.\n\n Individual bile acids in feces correlated with amino acid, purine, and lipid metabolic pathways in plasma.\n\n Furthermore, several fecal bile acids and bacterial species correlated with altered gene expression pathways in adipose tissue.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>VLCD dietary intervention in obese women changed the composition of several fecal microbial populations while preserving the core fecal microbiome.\n\n Changes in

SARS-CoV-2 viral load in respiratory specimens has been widely used to diagnose coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of COVID-19 patients.\n\n However, it is not clear whether testing for RNAaemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n The patients were divided into three groups according to the “Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition)” issued by the National Health Commission of China.\n\n The clinical and laboratory data were collected.\n\n The serum viral load and IL-6 levels were determined.\n\n .\n\n\nResults\nClinical characteristics analysis of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAaemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease.\n\n Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients.\n\n More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAaemia (R = 0.902).\n\n\nConclusions\nDetectable serum SARS-Cov-2 RNA(RNAaemia) in COVID-19 patients was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis.\n\n Because the elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm which could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic

Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors stabilize arachidonic acid-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which also stimulate inflammation resolution by promoting the production of pro-resolution mediators, activating anti-inflammatory processes, and preventing the cytokine storm.\n Both resolvins and EETs also attenuate pathological thrombosis and promote clot removal, which is emerging as a key pathology of COVID-19 infection.\n Thus, both SPMs and sEH inhibitors may promote the resolution of inflammation in COVID-19, thereby reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other life-threatening complications associated with robust viral-induced inflammation.\n While most COVID-19 clinical trials focus on “anti-viral” and “anti-inflammatory” strategies, stimulating inflammation resolution is a novel host-centric therapeutic avenue.\n Importantly, SPMs and sEH inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other inflammatory diseases and could be rapidly translated for the management of COVID-19 via debris clearance and inflammatory cytokine suppression.\n Here, we discuss using pro-resolution mediators as a potential complement to current anti-viral strategies for COVID-19.","id":"PMC7207990","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer US","authors":[{"firstname":"Dipak","surname":"Panigrahy","email":"dpanigra@bidmc.harvard.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Molly M.","surname":"Gilligan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sui","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Allison","surname":"Gartung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Irene","surname":"Cortés-Puch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patricia J.","surname":"Sime","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard P.","surname":"Phipps","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charles N.","surname":"Serhan","email":"cserhan@bwh.harvard.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bruce D.","surname":"Hammock","email":"bdhammock@ucdavis.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00134-020-05991-x","date":"2020-02-24","title":"Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China","abstract":"","id":"PMC7080116","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","authors":[{"firstname":"Qiurong","surname":"Ruan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kun","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kun","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxia","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxia","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lingyu","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lingyu","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianxin","surname":"Song","email":"songsingsjx@sina.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianxin","surname":"Song","email":"songsingsjx@sina.com","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047430","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients: awareness of an increased prevalence","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00134-020-06062-x","date":"2020-04-17","title":"High risk of thrombosis in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection: a multicenter prospective cohort study","abstract":"Purpose\nid='Par1'>Little evidence of increased thrombotic risk is available in COVID-19 patients.\n\n Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included.\n\n Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected.\n\n Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53;

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier
