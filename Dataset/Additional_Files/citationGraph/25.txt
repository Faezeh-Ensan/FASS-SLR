To verify the precise route of infection for the case, we conducted an in-depth epidemiological investigation in cooperation with the KCDC.\nMETHODS\nWe reviewed the MERS outbreak investigation report of the KCDC, and interviewed the healthcare worker who had recovered from MERS. Using the media interview data, we reaffirmed and supplemented the nature of the exposure.\nRESULTS\nThe healthcare worker, a nurse, was infected while performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a MERS patient in an isolation room. During the CPR which lasted for an hour, a large amount of body fluid was splashed. The nurse was presumed to have touched the mask to adjust its position during the CPR. She suggested that she was contaminated with the MERS patient's body fluids by wiping away the sweat from her face during the CPR.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe possible routes of infection may include the following: respiratory invasion of aerosols contaminated with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) through a gap between the face and mask; mucosal exposure to sweat contaminated with MERS-CoV; and contamination during doffing of personal protective equipment. The MERS guidelines should reflect this case to decrease the risk of infection during CPR.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is caused by MERS-CoV, a human coronavirus (CoV). Similar to SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), MERS-CoV can cause acute respiratory infections. After the confirmation of the index case of MERS-CoV in South Korea (hereafter Korea) on May 20, 2015, its outbreak spread to 17 hospitals during May-July 2015. As one of the outbreak clusters, 25 nosocomial cases were reported in two hospitals located in Daejeon Metropolitan City, Korea. Among the patients infected during the MERS outbreak, a healthcare worker was included, who was suspected to have been infected during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The investigation of such a possible risk of exposure should provide useful information for improvement of infection prevention guidelines during CPR on patients with infectious respiratory diseases. The Private Epidemiological MERS Investigation Support Team of Daejeon Metropolitan City (hereafter the Daejeon in-depth investigation team) conducted an in-depth epidemiological investigation from June to September 2015. As a result of this investigation, we report a case of a healthcare worker who was infected by MERS-CoV during CPR in a general hospital located in Daejeon Metropolitan City, Korea.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nData sources for description of the case included the report of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) Investigation Team (hereafter the KCDC investigation report) from the KCDC, investigation data of the Daejeon in-depth investigation team, and public media data such as the reported interview contents and the CPR scene. The exposure situation and clinical characteristics of the infected case were described using the KCDC investigation report, and exposure situation was reconfirmed and supplemented based on investigation data of the Daejeon in-depth investigation team and public media data regarding the infected healthcare worker. Since this study was conducted as a MERS outbreak epidemiological investigation, it was not required to undergo review and approval processes of an institutional review board according to Article 2 of the Enforcement Decree of the Bioethics and Safety Act (Scope of Human Subject Study).\nRESULTS\nOverview of hospital outbreak\nOn May 28, 2015, the outbreak began when Case A, who was hospitalized in hospital A in Daejeon without diagnosing MERS infection, visited the emergency room of hospital B. That afternoon, Case A was admitted to a 6-bed capacity respiratory ward. Thereafter, 5 inpatients, 2 family caregivers and 1 professional caregiver were infected in the room where Case A stayed, and the MERS Case B was one of the inpatients. Case B who was an 82-yearold male admitted for bacterial pneumonia and asthma was exposed to Case A, and transferred to an isolated negative-pressure room in the surgical intensive care unit on May 30, 2015.\nExposure situation of healthcare worker participating in cardiopulmonary resuscitation\nOn June 1, 2015, Case B experienced fever. On June 3, Case B had an aggravation of pneumonia leading to hypoxia and underwent CPR in the isolated room. The isolated negative-pressure room was designed to allow air to flow from the hallway to the window side. A large amount of hemoptysis was released during intubation, and came into contact with the bed sheet and personal protective equipment (PPE) of the healthcare workers. Hemoptysis was continuously observed while suctioning the airways. Although 6 healthcare workers wearing Level D PPE performed CPR for about 1 hour, Case B finally died, and was confirmed as a case of MERS on June 4, 2015.\nCase C was a 39-year-old female nurse who participated in the above described CPR. In an interview with the Daejeon in-depth investigation team, she stated that she stayed in the isolated room for about 3 hours for CPR (1 hour) and to clean-up (2 hours), and that a large amount of body fluids splashed on her PPE during the CPR. According to a closed-circuit television (CCTV) video in the KCDC investigation team data, Case C was found to have stayed in the isolated room for about 3 hours, and touched the mask and goggle with her hands in contaminated gloves. In a press conference when returning to the hospital after complete recovery, Case C said, &quot;I know that I was infected by MERS within body fluids of the patient when I unconsciously wiped off my sweat,&quot; and also explained the situation of exposure during CPR, &quot;Since the goggle was heavy, I thought it slid down together with the mask.&quot;\nClinical progress of Case C\nCase C had no medical history that might have affected the onset of the infectious disease and its prognosis. On June 5, 2015, she experienced muscular pain at home after work, which intermittently appeared until June 10, 2015. On June 8, 2015, she experienced chills, but no fever. In the morning of June 11, 2015, Case C experienced abdominal pain while at work in the hospital; upon visiting the emergency room, her body temperature was 37.5 C. After being reported to the manager of the intensive care unit, Case C was isolated in a 1-bed ward in the afternoon of the same day. On June 11, 2015, a confirmatory test with a throat swab specimen yielded negative results, whereas a confirmatory test with sputum showed positive results on June 14, 2015. Case C was transferred to the national inpatient isolation units on the day of the confirmation. Finally, Case C completely recovered and was discharged on July 4, 2015.\nQuarantine of the contacted\nHaving been identified to have been in contact with Case C in the hospital, 169 people (51 patients and 118 hospital employees) were subjected to either cohort quarantine or home quarantine for 14 days. However, there were no more newly infected people.\nDISCUSSION\nThis case appears to be the first report of infection by MERS-CoV during CPR in the world including the Middle East. Although there were multiple cases of healthcare workers infected by MERS in hospitals, there was no case related with CPR. In case of SARS that is similar to MERS, there was a case suspected to be infected during CPR. In 2003, Christian et al. reported that a healthcare worker was infected during CPR for a patient with SARS.\nSince Case C was found to have no contact with other MERS patients in the hospital except the corresponding CPR situation, Case C was suspected to have been infected during CPR for Case B. When judged based on non-specific symptoms such as muscular pain and chills, the incubation period of Case C seemed to be 2 days, while it could be 8 days if calculated based on fever. In infection of healthcare workers, manifestation of symptoms is likely to be delayed, because their basal health conditions are generally good. However, Case C showed non-specific symptoms relatively early, which suggests that Case C was exposed to a high level of MERS-CoV during CPR.\nDespite the paucity of literature regarding the invasion route of MERS-CoV, potential infection routes of the present case can be speculated through the addition of literature for the invasion route of SARS, which are as follows (Table 1).\nRespiratory invasion of aerosols contaminated with MERS-CoV (potential infectious route 1): It is possible that there was sweat during CPR. While the upper body was moving, the mask and goggle could lose close contact with the face, and then slide down, which could create a gap that air could flow in. It seemed that Case C touched the goggle and mask to try to reposition them. In this case, it is possible to be exposed to droplets or aerosols that were contaminated with MERS-CoV. CPR is an aerosol-generating procedure, so air-borne precautions are required. During CPR, aerosols can be generated during intubation, suctioning of body fluids, chest compression, manual ventilation, and defibrillation.\nInvasion by MERS-CoV-contaminated sweat through mucous membranes (potential infectious route 2): It is also possible that body fluids of the MERS patient came into contact with the face of Case C, passed underneath the goggle or the mask in a mix with sweat, and then invaded through mucous membranes of the eyes, nose or the mouth. This route may include both cases in which body fluids of the CPR patient were splashed directly to the face of Case C and if contaminated gloves came into contact with the face.\nContamination with MERS-CoV while removing the PPE (potential infectious route 3): Contamination also frequently occurs while doffing the PPE. Areas including the neck, foot, and head are frequently contaminated during doffing. In the present case, it is also possible that Case C might have been contaminated with MERS-CoV whiles doffing.\nThe present case suggests the following implications for prevention of infection: First, it seemed that prolonged CPR mainly contributed to MERS infection in the present case. Considering the age, underlying disease and the large amount of continuous hemoptysis from the CPR subject, it was postulated that it exceeded the effective length of CPR time. Family consent is an important consideration to stop CPR in the Korean medical culture. In the present case, it seemed that CPR was prolonged due to delayed family consent. To address this issue, the length of CPR time should be limited for patients with highly infectious diseases from the medical standpoint. Regarding ethics, it should be discussed for how long CPR should be performed, as the performer might stand the risk of infection.\nSecond, healthcare workers who perform CPR for MERS patients as in the present case should wear Level C PPE (composed of chemically resistant clothing, powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR], chemically resistant gloves, and chemically resistant boots) rather than Level D PPE (composed of whole-body gowns, N95 equivalent mask, gloves, goggles or face shield, and shoe covers). During CPR for a MERS patient, it is possible that aerosols contaminated with MERS-CoV could be generated and excretion from the patient could be splashed on the performer's face. When wearing Level D PPE, the CPR performer may experience short-breath and sweat due to physical exertion. If the mask and goggle are not tightly adhered to the face, a gap may become a route of MERS-CoV infection. Level C PPE should be able to address most of such issues. If Level D PPE is used in the absence of Level C PPE, PAPR with a hood should be added instead of a mask and goggle. While these were not included in the 2015 KCDC guidelines for management of MERS, most of them were included in the 2016 guidelines. In the future MERS countermeasure revision process, preparation and application of Level C PPE for emergency situations such as CPR should be discussed.\nSince this in-depth epidemiological investigation failed to obtain the CCTV video, it was unable to secure objective evidence for a detailed situation of the exposure. However, information related to potential exposure routes were identified through interview and press report data. These data sources were useful for elaborating exposure situation that was described in the initial survey data, the KCDC investigation report.\nIn summary, the present case involved the infection of a healthcare worker by MERS-CoV during CPR, in which identified potential infection routes included respiratory invasion through aerosols, exposure of mucous membrane to contaminated sweat, and contamination during doffing. This case suggests the need to revise the guidelines for management of MERS in terms of performing CPR and wearing PPE.\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare for this study.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nSupplementary material (Korean version) is available at http://www.e-epih.org/.\nREFERENCES\nMERS: emergence of a novel human coronavirus\n2015 MERS outbreak in Korea: hospital-to-hospital transmission\nHigh fatality rates and associated factors in two hospital outbreaks of MERS in Daejeon, the Republic of Korea\n&quot;I was fine to be sick, but I was afraid to infect others&quot;.

of small cytokines and generally have low molecular weight ranging from 7 to 15kDa.\n Chemokines and their receptors are able to control the migration and residence of all immune cells.\n Some chemokines are considered pro-inflammatory, and their release can be induced during an immune response at a site of infection, while others are considered homeostatic and are involved in controlling of cells migration during tissue development or maintenance.\n The physiologic importance of this family of mediators is resulting from their specificity ? members of the chemokine family induce recruitment of well-defined leukocyte subsets.\n There are two major chemokine sub-families based upon cysteine residues position: CXC and CC.\n As a general rule, members of the CXC chemokines are chemotactic for neutrophils, and CC chemokines are chemotactic for monocytes and sub-set of lymphocytes, although there are some exceptions.\n This review discusses the potential role of chemokines in inflammation focusing on the two best-characterized chemokines: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, a CC chemokine, and interleukin-8, a member of the CXC chemokine

cases of infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus: a report of nosocomial transmission","abstract":"Background\nHuman infection with a novel coronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East in September, 2012, with 44 laboratory-confirmed cases as of May 23, 2013. We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nPatient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad.\n\n Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders.\n\n We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV.\n\n\nFindings\nInitial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea.\n\n Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\n Both patients developed acute renal failure.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22·9 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22·5 for upE and 23·9 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive.\n\n The two patients shared the same room for 3 days.\n\n The incubation period was estimated at 9–12 days for the second case.\n\n No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected.\n\n Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients with respiratory symptoms returning from the Middle East or exposed to a confirmed case should be isolated and investigated for MERS-CoV with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed incubation period of 12 days.\n\n Immunosuppression should also be taken into account as a risk factor.\n\n\nFunding\nFrench Institute for Public Health Surveillance, ANR grant Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious

host cells","abstract":"id='Par1'>In face of the everlasting battle toward COVID-19 and the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2, no specific and effective drugs for treating this disease have been reported until today.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, mediates the virus infection by binding to spike protein.\n Although ACE2 is expressed in the lung, kidney, and intestine, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung.\n Considering the great infectivity of COVID-19, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may depend on other routes to facilitate its infection.\n Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification.\n Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment.\n Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice.\n Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient.\n Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab.\n Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis.\n Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.","id":"PMC7714896","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

Thirteen studies were included of which nine included cardiac arrest patients (n = 3098) and four included patients with cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction (n = 235).\n\n Data were pooled by a Mantel-Haenzel random effects model and heterogeneity was examined by the I\n2 statistic.\n\n\nResults\nIn cardiac arrest, the use of ECLS was associated with an absolute increase of 30 days survival of 13 % compared with patients in which ECLS was not used [95 % CI 6–20 %; p &lt; 0.001; number needed to treat (NNT) 7.7] and a higher rate of favourable neurological outcome at 30 days (absolute risk difference 14 %; 95 % CI 7–20 %; p &lt; 0.0001; NNT 7.1).\n\n Propensity matched analysis, including 5 studies and 438 patients (219 in both groups), showed similar results.\n\n In cardiogenic shock, ECLS showed a 33 % higher 30-day survival compared with IABP (95 % CI, 14–52 %; p &lt; 0.001; NNT 13) but no difference when compared with TandemHeart/Impella (?3 %; 95 % CI ?21 to 14 %; p = 0.70; NNH 33).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn cardiac arrest, the use of ECLS was associated with an increased survival rate as well as an increase in favourable neurological outcome.\n\n In the setting of cardiogenic shock there was an increased survival with ECLS compared with IABP.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00134-016-4536-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5106498","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","authors":[{"firstname":"Dagmar M.","surname":"Ouweneel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jasper V.","surname":"Schotborgh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jacqueline","surname":"Limpens","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Krischan D.","surname":"Sjauw","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.

First, we determined the appropriate cut-off duration for CPR based on the discrimination of good and poor neurological outcomes in the patients who received only CCPR, and then we compared the outcome between the CCPR group and ECPR group by using propensity score matching.\n\n Second, we compared CPR related data according to the neurologic outcome in matched ECPR group.\n\n\nResults\nOf 499 patients suitable for inclusion, 444 and 55 patients were enrolled in the CCPR and ECPR group, respectively.\n\n The predicted duration for a favorable neurologic outcome (CPC1, 2) is?&lt;?21 minutes of CPR in only CCPR patients.\n\n The matched ECPR group with???21 minutes of CPR duration had a more favorable neurological outcome than the matched CCPR group at 3 months post-arrest.\n\n In matched ECPR group, younger age, witnessed arrest without initial asystole rhythm, early achievement of mean arterial pressure???60 mmHg, low rate of ECPR-related complications, and therapeutic hypothermia were significant factors for expecting good neurologic outcome.\n\n\nConclusions\nECPR should be considered as an alternative method for attaining good neurological outcomes in OHCA patients who required prolonged CPR, especially of???21 minutes.\n\n Younger or witnessed arrest patients without initial asystole were good candidates for ECPR.\n\n After implantation of ECPR, early hemodynamic stabilization, prevention of ECPR-related complications, and application of therapeutic hypothermia may improve the neurological outcome.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4189722","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Su Jin","surname":"Kim","email":"icarusksj@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jae Seung","surname":"Jung","email":"heartistcs@naver.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jae Hyoung","surname":"Park","email":"jhpark3992@naver.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jong Su","surname":"Park","email":"vince019@hanmail.net","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yun Sik","surname":"Hong","email":"yshong@korea.ac.kr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sung Woo","surname":"Lee","email":"kuedlee@korea.ac.kr","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.resuscitation.2014.06.022","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Improved outcome of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest-a comparison with that for extracorporeal rescue for in-hospital cardiac arrest","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.resuscitation.2011.10.013","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Favourable survival of in-hospital compared to out-of-hospital refractory cardiac arrest patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: an Italian tertiary care centre experience","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation outcome reports: update of the Utstein resuscitation registry templates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a statement for healthcare professionals from a task force of the international liaison committee on resuscitation (American Heart Association, European Resuscitation Council, Australian and New Zealand Council on Resuscitation, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, InterAmerican Heart Foundation, Resuscitation Council of Southern Africa, Resuscitation Council of Asia);

cardiopulmonary resuscitation","abstract":"Background\nExtracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) refers to use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\n Although ECPR can increase survival rates after cardiac arrest, it can also result in poor post-resuscitation neurological status.\n\n Thus, we investigated predictors of good neurological outcomes after successful ECPR.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 227 patients underwent ECPR from May 2004 to June 2013 at Samsung Medical Center.\n\n Successful ECPR was defined as survival more than 24 hours after ECPR.\n\n Neurological outcomes were assessed at discharge using the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories scale (CPC).\n\n CPC 1 and 2 were classified as good and CPC 3 to 5 were classified as poor neurological outcomes.\n\n Excluded were 22 patients who did not survive more than 24 hours after ECPR and 90 patients who died from unknown causes or causes other than brain death or whose neurological status could not be assessed at discharge.\n\n Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of neurological outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nIncluded were 115 patients with a mean age of 58 (range 45–66) years and 80 men (70%).\n\n Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed at non-hospital sites for 19 (17%) patients and bystander CPR was performed in 9 of 19 cases (47%).\n\n Cardiac etiology was verified in 74 (64%) patients and therapeutic hypothermia was performed in 9 patients (8%); 68 (59%) had good neurological outcomes and 47 (41%) did not and 24 patients died from brain death.\n\n Neurological outcomes were affected by hemoglobin levels before ECMO (P?=?0.02), serum lactic acid (P?&lt;?0.001) before ECMO insertion, and interval from cardiac arrest to ECMO (P?=?0.04).\n\n\nConclusions\nLow hemoglobin or high serum lactic acid levels before ECMO, and prolonged interval from cardiac arrest to ECMO predicted poor neurological outcomes after successful ECPR.\n\n Early institution of ECMO and a low threshold for blood transfusion might improve neurological outcomes for patients who survive ECPR.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4358703","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

We investigated a possible cluster of SARS-CoV infections in healthcare workers who used contact and droplet precautions during attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a SARS patient. Unlike previously reported instances of transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, the index case-patient was unresponsive, and the intubation procedure was performed quickly and without difficulty. However, before intubation, the patient was ventilated with a bag-valve-mask that may have contributed to aerosolization of SARS-CoV. On the basis of the results of this investigation and previous reports of SARS transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, a systematic approach to the problem is outlined, including the use of the following: 1) administrative controls, 2) environmental engineering controls, 3) personal protective equipment, and 4) quality control.\nDuring the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a great deal was discovered about the illness and the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV infection is thought to occur primarily by either contact or large respiratory droplet transmission. However, despite the use of infection control precautions and personal protective equipment designed to prevent contact and droplet transmission, episodes of SARS-CoV transmission to healthcare workers have continued to occur under certain circumstances.\nOf particular concern are procedures performed on SARS patients that may aerosolize SARS-CoV and lead to limited airborne transmission or enhanced contact and droplet transmission. Such procedures include noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP), intubation, and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. As a result, special infection control procedures have been recommended for aerosol-generating procedures. We present the results of an investigation of the first reported transmission of SARS-CoV to healthcare workers that occurred during attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a completely unresponsive SARS patient. On the basis of the results of this investigation, as well as previous reports of SARS transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, we used the continuous quality improvement framework to suggest interventions for preventing future episodes of transmission.\nMethods\nData were collected through interviews of healthcare workers present during the attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation where transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to have occurred. Interviews included a structured questionnaire component. Hospital and provincial policies in place at the time of the resuscitation were reviewed. The hospital patient-care environment was inspected by a team of environmental engineers and industrial hygienists. Laboratory specimens, collected with nasopharyngeal swabs, were obtained from healthcare workers with symptoms that fulfilled the SARS clinical case definition after exposure during the attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation. These were tested by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with primers specific for SARS-CoV. After participants gave informed consent, convalescent-phase serum was collected from all consenting healthcare workers exposed to the attempted resuscitation event as part of a larger seroprevalence study of hospital staff. For this, samples were analyzed with a commercially available indirect immunofluorescent assay (Euroimmune, Lubeck, Germany) according to the directions of the manufacturer.\nIn addition, a limited evaluation of the Stryker T4 Personal Protection System (Stryker Instruments, Kalamazoo, MI), worn by some of the healthcare workers involved in the resuscitation attempt, was conducted to estimate the operating parameters, including particle removal efficiency and air-flow rate. A Met One Model 227B Hand-Held Particle Counter (Met One, Inc., Grants Pass, OR) was used to count ambient particles outside and inside the hood; five replicates were collected for each condition over a 1-minute sampling period. All information was obtained as part of an ongoing joint investigation into the cause of the second phase of the Toronto SARS outbreak conducted by Toronto Public Health, Health Canada, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nCase Report\nA 67-year-old woman with a history of asthma was admitted to hospital A on May 24, 2003, with a 5 day history of fever, cough, malaise, headache, and myalgias. The patient's mother had recently been admitted to the same hospital and died of a nosocomial pneumonia after orthopedic surgery for a fractured hip. On the basis of clinical findings and the identification of secondary infections in exposed persons, the mother's death was retrospectively determined to be due to SARS. On admission, the patient was febrile and her chest radiograph showed left lower lobe and lingular infiltrates. Both acute-phase serologic tests and serum RT-PCR were positive for SARS-CoV (National Microbiology Laboratory, Health Canada, Toronto). She was admitted to the hospital and placed in respiratory isolation on the SARS unit. Progressive respiratory failure later developed in the patient, and within 72 hours of admission, she required 100% supplemental oxygen. On May 28, 2003, she was found to have no vital signs and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted.\nNine healthcare workers participated in the resuscitation attempt. Three ward nurses (RN1-3) were the initial responders (Table). RN1 performed chest compressions while RN2 and RN3 prepared suction, oxygen, and intubation equipment. Three intensive care unit nurses (ICU-RN1-3), two respiratory therapists (RT1 and 2), and a physician (MD) also participated in the resuscitation. ICU-RN1 took over chest compressions from ward-RN1. ICU-RN2 inserted a peripheral intravenous catheter (IV) in the left foot of the patient and administered medications via the IV during the resuscitation attempt. ICU-RN3 ventilated the patient with a bag-valve-mask, without a bacterial/viral filter. RT1 performed the endotracheal intubation, which was completed in &lt;30 seconds. No suctioning was required during or after the intubation and no respiratory secretions or other bodily substances were observed in the environment. A bacterial/viral filter was placed on the bag-valve-mask after the intubation.\nHealthcare worker exposures, personal protective equipment, and outcomea\nCode team member	Tasks : (duration of exposure)	Exposure time	Protective equipment	Symptoms : (onset)	SARS serologic findings	 	Ward RN1	Contact before code (120 min), compressions (&lt;5 min), assisted IV insertion (5 min), observed code (10 min), wrap body (10-15 min)	150-155 min	Gown x 2, gloves x 2, safety glasses, shoe covers, hair cover, N95 respirator	None	Refused testing	 	Ward RN2	Set up suction equip (5 min), charting arrest record (15 min), wrapped body (10-15 min)	30-35 min	Gown x 2, gloves x 2, safety glasses, face shield, shoe covers, hair cover, N95 respirator	None	Negative	 	Ward RN3	Set up oxygen equip (5 min), prepared intubation equipment (10 min), observed (5 min), : wrapped body (10-15 min)	30-35 min	Gown x 2, gloves x 2, safety glasses, face shield, shoe cover, hair cover, N95 respirator	Headache, myalgia, Tmax 37.8 C (June 1)	Negative	 	ICU RN1	Chest compressions : (10-15 min)	10-15 min	Gown x 2, gloves x 2, safety glasses, face shield, shoe cover, hair cover, N95 respirator	Headache, malise, myalgia, nausea, Tmax 38.0 C (May 31)	Indeterminate	 	ICU RN2	IV insertion in foot (&lt;5 min), medication administration (10 min), application of EKG leads (&lt;1 min)	10-15 min	Gown x 2, gloves x 2, safety glasses, face shield, shoe cover, hair cover, N95 respirator	Myalgia, malaise, SOA, Tmax 38.5 C (May 31)	Positive	 	ICU RN3	Ventilated patient with bag-valve-mask (5-10 min)	5-10 min	Gown x 2, gloves x 2, safety glasses, face shield, shoe cover, hair cover, N95 respirator	None	Negative	 	RT1	Intubated patient (&lt;30 s), ventilated patient with bag-valve-mask (10-15 min)	10-15 min	T4 Personal Protection System, N95 respirator	None	Refused testing	 	RT2	Put filter on ETT and assisted RT1 (5-7 min)	5-10 min	T4 Personal Protection System, N95 respirator	None	Refused testing	 	MD	Chest compressions (5-7 min)	5-10 min	T4 Personal Protection System, N95 respirator	None	Refused testing	 	\naSARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; RN1, ward nurse 1; RN2, ward nurse 2; RN3, ward nurse 3; ICU-RN1, intensive care unit nurse 1; ICU-RN2, intensive care unit nurse 2; ICU-RN3, intensive care unit nurse 3; RT1, respiratory therapist 1; RT2, respiratory therapist 2; MD, physician; IV, intravenous catheter; Tmax, maximum temperature; EKG, electrocardiogram; ETT, endotracheal tube\nAll nurses in the room during the resuscitation were wearing protection equipment that was considered standard for routine SARS patient care at this hospital. This equipment consisted of two gowns, two sets of gloves, goggles, a full-face shield (with the exception of RN1 and RN2), shoe covers, hair cover, and NIOSH-approved N95 disposable respirators that were not fit-tested. In addition, all nurses involved in the resuscitation were experienced in working on SARS units and thus familiar with the recommended infection control policies and procedures. In contrast to the nurses, both RTs and the MD were wearing T4 Personal Protection Systems during the resuscitation. All nurses left the room immediately after the intubation and removed their protection equipment following the standard hospital protocol. Approximate exposure times are outlined in Table.\nOn May 31, 2003, both ICU-RN1 and ICU-RN2 had a temperature &gt;38.0 C, myalgia, and malaise. In addition, ICU-RN1 complained of headache and nausea, and ICU-RN2 reported dyspnea. ICU-RN1 had a normal chest radiograph results, but the radiograph of ICU-RN2 showed a left lower lobe infiltrate that persisted for several days. Both RNs were admitted to the hospital for observation; their condition remained stable. RN3 reported a headache and myalgia on June 1, 2003, but her maximum temperature reached only 37.8 C. She remained in home quarantine, and her symptoms resolved without further progression. Results of RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal swabs from ICU-RN1 and ICU-RN2 were negative. At present, only one case (ICU-RN2) meets the World Health Organization criteria for probable SARS, one case (ICU-RN1) is under investigation, and the third (RN3) does not meet the case definition as her temperature remained &lt;38.0 C. A review of the 48-hour period before the resuscitation did not show any other likely transmission episodes. In particular, ICU-RN2 was the charge nurse in the ICU and had little or no direct patient contact in the 48 hours before the resuscitation. Five of the nine healthcare workers involved in the resuscitation agreed to participate in serologic testing. All convalescent-phase samples were collected &gt;30 days after the event (Table).\nEvaluation of the Stryker T4 Personal Protection System indicated an average removal efficiency of 68% for particles &gt;0.5 mum in diameter and 54% for particles &gt;5 mum. This equates to a reduction factor (i.e., particles outside of the hood would be reduced in number by this factor) of 3.1 and 2.2, respectively.\nDiscussion\nThis report describes the apparent transmission of SARS-CoV from a patient to healthcare workers during an attempted resuscitation. The similar symptom onset dates suggest a point source of exposure. In this case, SARS-CoV was transmitted despite healthcare workers' wearing protection equipment designed to protect against contact and droplet transmission; no breaches in droplet protection equipment were identified, and exposure times were fairly brief. Although SARS transmission that involved intubation and BiPAP have been reported, this episode is unique in that the patient was neither conscious nor breathing at the time of the intubation, and the intubation procedure was performed quickly and without difficulty. These factors make it less likely that transmission occurred as a direct result of the intubation procedure. Instead, it is more likely that transmission was related to events leading up to the intubation. In this case, just as in previous cases, either contact, droplet, or airborne transmission might have occurred.\nDirect and indirect contact are the most common forms of transmission for most nosocomial pathogens; transmission between patients or from patient to healthcare worker usually follows contamination of the healthcare workers' hands after touching either the patient or a fomite that came into direct contact with the patient. Large aerosol droplets (i.e., &gt;10 mum) can, in addition to contaminating both animate and inanimate surfaces in close range of the patient, travel short distances through the air and make direct contact with the exposed mucous membranes of healthcare workers or other patients.\nIn contrast, airborne transmission is mediated by respiratory aerosols. These aerosols of infectious organisms contain droplet nuclei &lt;10 mum in size and, depending upon their size within this range as well as ambient environmental conditions, can float on air currents and remain airborne for many hours. A large variety of viruses are transmissible through both contact and airborne modes. Often, investigation of the epidemiology of nosocomial viral infections, establishes the occurrence of airborne transmission.\nTwo explanations may account for the transmission observed in this case: 1) an unrecognized breach in contact and droplet precautions occurred, or 2) an airborne viral load was great enough to overwhelm the protection offered by droplet precautions, including non-fit-tested N95 disposable respirators. If the last form of transmission was responsible, airborne virus may have been generated by the coughing patient before her cardiopulmonary arrest or due to a &quot;cough-like&quot; force produced by the airway pressures created during asynchronous chest compressions and ventilations using the bag-valve-mask.\nRegardless of the exact mode of transmission in this case, several lessons were learned through our investigation that may help reduce the risk of transmission to healthcare workers. A systematic approach to this problem is outlined considering the following framework: 1) administrative controls, 2) environmental engineering, 3) protection equipment, and 4) quality control.\nAdministrative Controls\nPolicies and protocols for emergency resuscitation involving patients known to have or suspected of having SARS should include 1) description of the roles and responsibilities of healthcare workers responding to the emergency, 2) mechanisms to alert responders that the emergency involves a potentially contagious patient (e.g., announcing the code as an &quot;isolation code blue&quot;), 3) steps to limit the number of healthcare workers involved to minimize potential exposures, 4) plans for having auxiliary staff staged in a safe area where they can be easily called on if needed but otherwise preventing unnecessary exposure, 5) plans for safe disposal and cleaning of equipment used during the emergency response, and 6) procedures for disposition of the patient after the emergency, either to the ICU if resuscitation is successful or the morgue if unsuccessful.\nPolicies must be developed that consider all high-risk exposures or emergency situations and not just individual procedures. Policies that are too focused are of little value in dealing with the hundreds of unforeseeable possible situations that may arise. Conversely, policies that educate healthcare workers to assess the risks of a task and empower them to take appropriate protective action will be more effective. These policies should be crafted at each healthcare facility by a team that involves key stakeholders, including persons involved in the clinical response along with infection control practitioners and infectious disease experts.\nIt is also important to minimize the chance that a patient will suffer unwitnessed cardiopulmonary arrest or require emergency intubation on a SARS unit. Prevention of these events will involve two changes in policy. The first is to recognize that isolation wards cannot be staffed with the same nurse-to-patient ratio as a regular ward. Care of patients in isolation is more time intensive due to both the physical barriers (e.g., anterooms, doors kept closed at all times) and the required use of protection equipment. The nurse-to-patient ratio on the SARS ward at the time of the arrest was between 1:4 and 1:5; a more ideal ratio might be 1:2 or 1:3. It is also necessary to have a lower threshold for transferring patients to a higher acuity setting (i.e., ICU or stepdown unit) when they first begin to show signs of a clinical deterioration. To enable this, all patients on a SARS unit should have measurement of vital signs along with pulse oximetry at a minimum of every 4 hours. Should their oxygen saturation drop below 92% on room air one should administer oxygen through nasal prongs 1-4 L per minute to maintain saturation &gt;92%, and increase vital signs/pulse oximetry to every 2 hours. If the patient subsequently requires oxygen through nasal prongs at &gt;4 L per minute the responsible physician should be notified and increase vital signs or pulse oximetry to every 1 hour. Finally, if the patient requires supplemental oxygen of &gt;40% to maintain saturation &gt;92%, the patient should be transferred to the intensive care unit and undergo elective intubation in a controlled manner. This later policy has worked well in other SARS units, as well as in hospital A after it was implemented by one of the authors (M.L.) after this cluster.\nFinally, policies should be developed to address the appropriateness and application of advanced cardiac life support for patients suffering cardiopulmonary arrest on a SARS ward. Many considerations must enter into any such discussion, including the usefulness and outcome of resuscitation efforts, particularly in unwitnessed arrests. Despite even the most well-planned and well-written policies, if healthcare workers are not trained in proper infection control practices, SARS will continue to be transmitted. Staff must be trained in both the application of policies as well as the use of protection equipment. In addition to education, practice is also important; for example, consideration should be given to staging one or more &quot;mock SARS code blue&quot; events.\nEnvironmental Controls\nThe second line of defense against the transmission of SARS is environmental engineering controls. These consist of physical engineering elements such as negative pressure rooms, dilution ventilation, high-efficiency particulate air filtration, ultraviolet lights, and scavenging devices. The primary goal of environmental engineering processes is to contain the infectious agent in a limited area and to minimize or rapidly decrease the viral load in the environment so that in the event of a breach in infection control process or protection equipment, the chance of healthcare workers or other patients becoming infected is minimized. In this case, a breach occurred in source control; the initial bag-valve-mask used in the resuscitation did not have a viral/bacterial filter on the exhaust. This breach may have resulted in &quot;uncontrolled&quot; release of aerosolized virus into the environment. However, previous studies with coxsackie virus showed that little or no virus is detectable in expired air, only in respiratory aerosols and droplets from coughing or sneezing.\nPersonal Protective Equipment\nThe final line of protection against occupational exposure is protection equipment. The use of N95 respirators offers a level of protection against airborne transmission of SARS. However, for any form of respiratory protection to perform at the level of its full potential, it must be properly fitted to provide an adequate seal. The N95 disposable respirators used by healthcare workers in this instance were not fit-tested to ensure an adequate seal. Thus the exact level of protection afforded by the N95 respirators for each person in this case is unknown. Nonetheless, a higher level of respiratory protection should be considered in environments with a potentially very high SARS-CoV load, such as that associated with aerosol-generating procedures\nAs a result of the transmission of SARS Co-V during aerosol-generating procedures, some hospitals in Ontario, Canada, have adopted use of the T4 Personal Protective System (Stryker Instruments) (Figure 1). This system was originally designed to maintain a highly sterile field during surgery to prevent operative site infections.\nA, T4 Stryker suit being applied with aid of assistants. Healthcare worker in T4 Stryker suit. Photos provided by Randy Wax and Laurie Mazrik, Ontario Provincial SARS Biohazard Education Team.\nAs a form of protection equipment, this system has both advantages and disadvantages. The primary advantage is that the entire body of the healthcare worker is covered, providing a high level of droplet protection. The primary disadvantage of the T4 is the length of time required to put one on during an emergency. In the emergency resuscitation described in this report, the delay in certain rescuers responding was due to the time required to put on the T4. This resulted in the need for a second code blue to be announced for the same patient, which drew additional personnel to the code and thus increased the number of healthcare workers exposed to SARS.\nThe healthcare worker must also be attentive to avoid contamination when removing the T4. Moreover, the airborne reduction factors of 3.1, for particles &gt;0.5 mum in diameter, and 2.2 for particles &gt;5 mum were less than the protection factor of 10 that is assigned (i.e., minimum expected in practice) for a fit-tested, disposable N95 respirator. However, a disposable N95 is commonly worn under the T4 used in Ontario hospitals, suggesting the respiratory protection afforded healthcare workers using the T4 would be greater.\nThe powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) most commonly used in healthcare settings have a disposable full hood with face shield covering the healthcare worker's upper body (Figure 2). This device provides a higher level of protection against airborne infectious agents (any PAPR equipped with a hood or helmet with any type of particulate air filter has an assigned protection factor of 25), and it may be faster and easier to apply in an emergency situation. Finally, ensuring that a hospital has adequate protection against airborne diseases, even if not absolutely required for SARS, will ensure that staff are prepared to deal with future emerging infectious diseases or bioterrorism events that could involve airborne agents.\nHealthcare worker wearing powered air-purifying respirators for demonstration. Photos provided by Randy Wax and Laurie Mazrik, Ontario Provincial SARS Biohazard Education Team.\nRegardless of what device (T4 versus PAPR) is used in an institution for potentially aerosol generating procedures, it is essential that they are distributed throughout the hospital in areas where they are most likely to be required by primary responders in an emergency situation as opposed to a central area where teams must wait for them to be brought to the emergency. In addition, extra protection equipment should be included as part of any &quot;crash cart&quot; used by the responding code team.\nQuality Control\nAlthough there is a tendency to focus only on high-tech forms of protection equipment, it is important not to forget the basics of infection control procedures such as glove changing and hand hygiene. Healthcare workers must remain vigilant about not only protecting themselves from SARS transmission but also protecting against patient-to-patient transmission. As was found in the second phase of the SARS outbreak in Toronto, one of the best ways to prevent healthcare worker infections is to ensure that no sustained transmission of SARS occurs within the patient population, which may act as a reservoir of infection.\nAfter developing good policies and training staff who are rehearsed for emergencies and provided with appropriate protection equipment, the last step is to ensure ongoing adherence to the standards set. This adherence is achieved through quality control. Without an effective quality control program in place, lapses in infection control procedures will occur, particularly as healthcare workers become fatigued during a prolonged outbreak.\nA variety of quality control methods can be implemented, including administrative checks to ensure equipment is in good repair, policies are current, and training materials are up to date. Another quality control practice often used by emergency services personnel dealing with hazardous situations is the &quot;buddy system.&quot; In this system, healthcare workers always work in teams on SARS units with each person being responsible for double checking to make sure that their partner is wearing appropriate equipment and following correct infection control practices before entering a patient's room. Finally, a process should be in place to review responses to emergencies after they have occurred to learn from the experience and facilitate continuous quality improvement.\nConclusion\nSARS has increased the medical community's awareness of issues related to occupational health and safety. It has also highlighted the importance of infection control programs and practices. A systematic approach, including administrative controls, environmental engineering, protection equipment, and quality control, is advocated to prevent future SARS-CoV transmission to healthcare workers.\nSuggested citation for this article: Christian MD, Loutfy M, McDonald LC, Martinez KF, Ofner M, Wong T, et al.

accounts for psychological well-being through decreased rumination","abstract":"In the last few decades, mindfulness meditation has gained prominence as an adjunctive psychotherapeutic technique.\n In fact, a vast literature of controlled studies has found that mindfulness meditation is related to improved mental health across a variety of disorders.\n Elucidating the components involved in mindfulness meditation’s positive impact on psychological well-being is an important step in more precisely identifying the populations that would most benefit from its therapeutic utilization.\n Yet, a consensus regarding the particular underlying mechanisms that contribute to these outcomes is very much limited.\n There are many reasons for this, including the inconsistent operationalization and use of mindfulness meditation across research investigations.\n Despite the elusive mechanisms, many studies seem to indicate that cultivating different aspects of attention is a feasible, consistent, and parsimonious starting point bridging mindfulness practice and psychological well-being.\n Attention in itself is a complex construct.\n It comprises different networks, including alerting, orienting, and executive attention, and is also explained in terms of the way it is regulated.\n This paper supports a previously suggested idea that cultivating all aspects of attention through mindfulness meditation leads to greater psychological well-being through decreased ruminative processes.\n Ruminative processes are decreased by engaging in both focused and receptive attention, which foster the ability to distract and decenter.\n","id":"PMC4492627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Dove Medical Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Jennifer

arrest (OHCA) with an in-hospital mortality of about 70%.\n\n To identify predictors for the high mortality of OHCA patients and especially for women, that are considered at high risk for in-hospital mortality, we evaluated one specific setting of in-hospital treatment after OHCA: the emergency department (ED).\n\n\nMethods\nRetrospective analysis of consecutive ED admissions with OHCA at the Inselspital Bern, Switzerland from 1st June 2012 to 31th Mai 2015. Demographic, preclinical and ED medical data were compared for patient groups with return of circulation (ROSC) and on-going resuscitation (CPR) on admission, as well as for subgroups with and without ED mortality.\n\n Predictors for ED mortality were investigated using univariate analysis with logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nIn 354 patients (228 (64.4%) with ROSC; 126 (35.6%) with on-going CPR) we found an overall ED mortality of 28.5% (5.7% ROSC group; 69.8% on-going CPR group).\n\n Female gender (OR 7.053 (CI 95% 2.085; 24.853), p = 0.002) and greater age (OR 1.052 (95% CI 1.006–1.101), p = 0.029) were associated with ED mortality in the ROSC but not in the on-going CPR group.\n\n Ventricular fibrillation as initially monitored rhythm (OR 0.126 (95% CI 0.027–0.582), p = 0.008) and shorter CPR duration (OR 1.055 (95% CI 1.024;1.088), p = 0.001) were associated with ED survival in patients with ROSC but not in patients with on-going CPR on admission.\n\n In ROSC patients a higher lactate and lower pH were associated with mortality (pH: OR 0.009 (CI95% 0.000;0.420), p = 0.016; lactate: OR 1.183 (95% CI 1.037; 1.349), p = 0.013); similar in on-going CPR patients (pH 0.061 (95% CI 0.007, 0.558), p = 0.013, lactate: 1.146 (95% CI 1.041;1.261), p = 0.005).\n\n\nConclusion\nPatients with ROSC who died during ED care were predominantly women and older patients, as well as patients with non-shockable initial heart rhythm and long CPR durations.\n\n In patients with on-going CPR on admission, no clinical or demographic predictors for ED mortality were found.\n\n Higher lactate and lower pH were predictors in both OHCA groups.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5690603","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas C.","surname":"Sauter","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nora","surname":"Iten","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nora","surname":"Iten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrik R.","surname":"Schwab","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wolf E.","surname":"Hautz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Meret E.","surname":"Ricklin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aristomenis K.","surname":"Exadaktylos","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Schäfer","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Schäfer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00101-017-0401-6","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Out-of-Hospital Airway Management during Manual Compression or Automated Chest Compression Devices","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/s13054-017-1893-9","date":"2017-11-20","title":"Initial blood pH during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients: a multicenter observational registry-based study","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>When an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patient receives cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the emergency department (ED), blood laboratory test results can be obtained by using point-of-care testing during CPR.\n\n In the present study, the relationship between blood laboratory test results during CPR and outcomes of OHCA patients was investigated.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>This study was a multicenter retrospective analysis of prospective registered data that included 2716 OHCA patients.\n\n Data from the EDs of three university hospitals in different areas were collected from January 2009 to December 2014.

Airborne spread of the virus also accounted for certain community outbreaks of SARS (Yu et al. 2004). Healthcare workers (HCW) were at the highest risk of having the disease, accounting for one fifth of the global total (World Health Organization 2003). In Hong Kong, 23% of the cases of SARS were healthcare workers. In Canada and Singapore, the proportions were higher (40% and 41%, respectively), as they had fewer SARS cases in the community than Hong Kong. Risk factors for infection in HCWs have been studied extensively, and a review on SARS infection and healthcare workers disclosed a number of risk and protective factors (Chan-Yeung &amp; Yu 2003; Lau et al. 2004). For example, lack of awareness and pre-paredness when the disease first struck, poor institutional infection control measures, lack of training in infection control procedures, poor compliance with the use of personal protection equipment (PPE), exposure to high-risk procedures such as intubation and nebulisation, and exposure to unsuspected SARS patients were associated with SARS infection. Measures to prevent nosocomial infection included establishing isolation wards for triage SARS patients; training and monitoring hospital staff in infection-control procedures; active and passive screening of HCWs; enforcement of droplet and contact precautions; and compliance with the use of PPE.\nIn mainland China, 1 021 HCWs became infected, accounting for 19.2% of the 5 327 SARS cases in the whole country (Feng et al. 2009, this issue). Several hospitals in Beijing reported that nosocomial transmission occurred among HCWs, one of which (referred to hereafter as AFH (Armed Forces Hospital)) suffered one of the most serious outbreaks: 67 confirmed cases and 16 deaths among HCWs. Several studies were conducted during the outbreak. One case control study was designed to understand how HCWs contracted the disease and how to prevent their infection (Ma et al. 2004). It was conducted shortly after the epidemic, but the data have never been prepared for an English language publication. We therefore made a systematic analysis based on the data to investigate possible risk and protective factors associated with infection of SARS among the HCWs in AFH.\nMaterials and methods\nCases and controls\nThe retrospective case control study was conducted in AFH hospital in Beijing where the nosocomial outbreak was reported. The case group were all HCWs who were diagnosed as probable SARS cases admitted between 5 March and 17 May 2003, were recruited as cases. Diagnosis was based on WHO's criteria of documented fever (temperature &gt;38  C), presence of cough, shortness of breath or breathing difficulty, and a significant history of exposure to a SARS patient not more than 10 days prior to onset of symptoms, plus radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) on chest X-ray (CXR) (World Health Organization 2003). Two cases that were suspected of contracting the infection outside their hospital stay were excluded.\nEligible uninfected HCWs who worked in the same hospital and had self-reported exposure to SARS patients between March and May 2003 were identified as controls. They were subsequently confirmed following WHO vigorous criteria for close contacts: the exposure was only deemed to be definite, where there was a history of being within close physical proximity (1 m) of a patient subsequently confirmed with SARS (World Health Organization 2003). All cases and controls included were subsequently tested for Ig G antibody against SARS-CoV using ELISA method as previously described (Liu et al. 2006). For the case group, only one SARS patient was detected as IgG antibody negative, which was thereafter excluded from the analysis. For the control group, none of them was detected as serologically positive, thereby supporting that they had not been infected with SARS.\nEpidemiological investigation and data collection\nInterviews with cases and controls were carried out using a pre-tested questionnaire by a trained epidemiological group between June and July 2003. Information collected included demographic data (age, gender and ethnic group), personal medical history, coexisting conditions, work unit and ward, job description, SARS-related work behaviours, protection measures and training activities. All study participants gave oral informed consent before the interviews were conducted. Between 14 June and 19 June, the completed questionnaires were retrieved from all participants, after which they were immediately checked for validity and completeness.\nStatistical analysis\nData were analysed using spss (version 13.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) and S-plus software (version 6.0. Insightful Corp., Seattle, WA, USA). Logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Univariate analyses were conducted to determine the effect of each variable separately. For variables with missing value of &gt;5%, we performed logistic regression with being missing as binary outcome and age, sex and occupation as predictors to test their non-deviance of the possibility of having missing values against the important background variables.\nA multivariate logistic regression was fitted using a stepwise-forward procedure with all variables that were marginally significant (P &lt; 0.10) in the univariate analyses as candidates for selection. For the multivariate analysis we performed a stepwise-forward selection procedure and took care that at each step to select a new variable we only removed observations with missing values for the variables in the model. As a result, in the final model, cases were removed with missing values for selected variables only instead of missing values for all variables that were investigated. A stepwise-forward (or backward) procedure has a disadvantage that it does not show in how far predictors are chosen at random. Thereafter we calculated all correlations between predictors and selected from the significant pairs the ones with one predictor in the final multivariate model and one not in the model. If swapping of the chosen predictor by its correlated counterpart does not seriously deteriorate the model, we conclude that we cannot tell whether one or the other predictor played a role. For all the analyses, statistical tests were based on two-tailed probability. A P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nDescriptive epidemiology\nAltogether 477 completed questionnaires were successfully retrieved from infected staff (51) and uninfected controls (426). The cases represent 76% (51/67) of all infected survived staff in the hospital. Sixteen infected HCWs could not be accessed or refused to be studied. The control group represents over 90% of all employees who were exposed to SARS in the hospital. The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the two groups are listed in Table 1. The mean age was 29.5 +- 9.6 years for the cases, and 31.4 +- 8.8 years for the control group. The statistical analysis showed that the two groups were comparable in almost all of the demographic information we obtained, including age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, co-morbidity, occupation, educational level, job category, smoking and drinking habit, etc. The factor of close contact with SARS patients before2 April was over-represented in the case group compared to the control group (74%vs. 45%, P &lt; 0.001). Work load was expected to be an important factor for infection occurrence and was measured by the maximum (or average) number of contacts with SARS patients per day, and the maximum (or average) working hours in the SARS-designated isolation/contagious area per day. Statistical analysis showed that none of the factors mentioned above was significantly different between the two groups (Table 1).\n Demographic and epidemiological characteristics in cases and controls\nCharacteristics	Cases (%) n = 51	Controls (%) n = 426	P-value	 	Age (mean +- SD, range)	29.5 +- 9.6 (range: 17-69)	31.4 +- 8.8 (range: 19-74)	0.15	 	Gender	0.98	 	 Male	16 (31.4)	134 (31.5)		 	 Female	35 (68.6)	291 (68.5)		 	Marital status	0.42	 	 Single	24 (47.1)	164 (38.5)		 	 Married	26 (51.0)	257 (60.3)		 	 Divorced or widowed	1 (2.0)	5 (1.2)		 	Ethnic group	0.34	 	 Han	48 (94.1)	412 (96.7)		 	 Non-Han	3 (5.9)	14 (3.3)		 	Educational level	0.10	 	 Doctor and master	10 (19.6)	75 (17.6)		 	 College and equal	35 (68.6)	333 (78.2)		 	 High school or lower	6 (11.8)	18 (4.2)		 	Staff Category	0.33	 	 Registered	32 (64.0)	301 (70.7)		 	 Non-registered	18 (36.0)	125 (29.3)		 	Co-morbidity	0.38	 	 Yes	3 (5.9)	41 (9.6)		 	 No	48 (94.1)	385 (90.4)		 	Smoking	0.32	 	 No	40 (78.4)	366 (86.7)		 	 &lt;5/day	7 (13.7)	26 (6.2)		 	 5-10/day	3 (5.9)	25 (5.9)		 	 11-20/day	1 (2.0)	4 (0.9)		 	 &gt;20/day	0 (0)	1 (0.2)		 	Drinking alcohol	0.52	 	 Never	23 (52.3)	169 (46.2)		 	 Occasionally	21 (47.7)	190 (51.9)		 	 Frequently	0 (0.0)	7 (1.9)		 	Contact date	&lt;0.001	 	 Before 2 April	37 (74.0)	173 (44.9)		 	 After 2 April	13 (26.0)	212 (55.1)		 	Employment duration in years (mean +- SD)	7.91 +- 8.94	9.09 +- 8.41	0.38	 	Occupation	0.29	 	 Medical staff	16 (31.4)	155 (36.4)		 	 Nursing staff	25 (49.0)	220 (51.6)		 	 Other occupation	10 (19.6)	51 (12.0)		 	Working department		 	 Medical ward	37 (74.0)	303 (75.9)		 	 Emergency department	9 (18.0)	78 (19.5)		 	 Outpatient clinic	3 (6.0)	14 (3.5)		 	 Other location	1 (2.0)	4 (1.0)		 	Average number of contacts with SARS patients per day (mean +- SD)	5.0 +- 5.9	4.5 +- 6.3	0.67	 	Maximum number of contacts with SARS patients per day (mean +- SD)	8.5 +- 9.0	8.2 +- 10.9	0.91	 	Average hours working in isolation wards for SARS patients per day (mean +- SD)	6.0 +- 3.0	6.1 +- 2.8	0.88	 	Maximum hours working in isolation wards for SARS patients per day (mean +- SD)	7.8 +- 5.0	9.4 +- 7.6	0.26	 	Number of beds (mean +- SD)	9.4 +- 9.1	12.4 +- 10.1	0.17	 	\nSARS, Severe acute respiratory syndrome.\nUnivariate analysis\nAltogether we included 28 variables to test their association with disease occurrence, of which 17 gave significant results (P &lt; 0.10), including seven risk factors and 10 protective factors. For example, among the healthcare workers who reported emergency care experience (i.e. over a mean of 1 h) 21% got SARS infection, while only 8% of those without emergency care experience acquired SARS, reflecting a highly significant difference between both groups. Detailed information on the contact with SARS patients were identified. Contact with respiratory secretions, sputum, pathological specimens and deceased significantly increased the ORs of SARS infection. But this was not seen for other types of contact, i.e. with faeces, blood, urine, pulmonary lavage, medical waste, nursing contact or equipment contacts (Table 2).\n Univariate analysis of factors associated with SARS infection in healthcare workers\n Variable 	Number yes (number observed)	% SARS cases for yes-no group	P-value for difference	 	Contact: nursing	176 (477)	10.6-10.8	0.96	 	Contact: physical contact	341 (474)	11.3-10.3	0.75	 	Contact: injection	193 (476)	10.8-11.4	0.82	 	Contact: intubation	12 (477)	50.0-9.7	&lt;0.001	 	Contact: chest compression	15 (477)	33.3-11.1	0.02	 	Contact: respiratory secretion	115 (477)	18.3-9.0	0.004	 	Contact: sputum	122 (477)	18.0-8.2	0.004	 	Contact: faeces	102 (477)	12.7-10.1	0.45	 	Contact: urine	110 (477)	11.8-10.4	0.66	 	Contact: pulmonary lavage	2 (431)	0.0-11.9	1	 	Contact: equipment	61 (477)	13.0-10.6	0.83	 	Contact: pathological specimens	8 (477)	37.5-10.2	0.04	 	Contact: deceased	18 (477)	27.8-10.0	0.04	 	Contact: medical waste	113 (477)	11.5-10.4	0.75	 	Emergency care experience	90 (471)	21.1-8.4	0.001	 	Wearing 12-layer cotton surgical mask	123 (477)	6.5-12.1	0.07	 	Wearing 16-layer cotton surgical mask	274 (477)	5.5-17.7	&lt;0.001	 	Wearing N95 mask	33 (477)	6.1-11.0	0.37	 	Wearing disposable mask	95 (477)	11.6-10.5	0.76	 	Layers of masks	-	-	0.002	 	 One layer of masks	22 (477)	27.3-14.8	-	 	 Multiple layers of masks	286 (477)	7.0-14.8	-	 	Wearing glasses	212 (432)	7.5-15.9	0.006	 	Multiple layers of protective clothes	221 (306)	6.8-14.1	0.052	 	Wearing gloves	364 (376)	7.4-33.3	0.011	 	Protective eyewear (goggle)	221 (477)	7.7-13.3	0.046	 	Taking prophylactic medicine	384 (473)	8.6-20.2	0.003	 	Performing nose wash	193 (477)	4.7-14.8	&lt;0.001	 	Total number of sleeping hours per day	-	-	0.12	 	 No change	222 (407)	11.3-11.4	-	 	 Increase	52 (407)	7.7-11.4	-	 	Taking training	267 (400)	5.6-19.5	&lt;0.001	 	\nThe previously reported high-risk activities were also identified in the studied subjects: Endotracheal intubation and chest compression were behaviours significantly associated with high risk for infection. The other activities, including post-mortem, intensive care unit (ICU) nursing, sample collection and chest physiotherapy, patient transferring etc. did not achieve significant results, all with P &gt; 0.10.\nTwo kinds of personal protective equipment were studied, face protection and body protection. Six categories of most often used masks were identified from the participating staff: disposable mask, surgical mask, 12-layer cotton surgical mask, 16-layer cotton surgical mask, N95, and higher-level protective respirator. When evaluated individually, 12-layer cotton surgical mask and 16-layer cotton surgical mask displayed significant difference of distribution between the two groups. Healthcare workers who wore glasses had about half the risk of SARS compared to those not wearing glasses (P = 0.006) (Table 2). A similar reduction in ORs was achieved by wearing a protective goggle when attending to patients (P = 0.046), and washing the nose after attending to patients showed an even stronger effect (P = 0.0002) (the nose wash was performed as a nasopharyngeal rinse for cleansing). Wearing gloves and multiple layers of protective gowns also each reduced the ORs of infection significantly (P = 0.011 and P = 0.052, respectively). Among the administrative factors, taking training in infection control before contact with patients and taking prophylactic medicine (including anti-viral medicine and supplemental nutrition to enhance immunity) were shown to be protective (P &lt; 0.001 and 0.003, respectively).\nFive significant univariate variables (contact date, wearing glasses, layers of protective clothes, wearing gloves and taking training) had missing values of &gt;5%. The only significant difference between individuals with and without missing values is that the probability for not answering the question about wearing gloves is smaller for nurses (data not shown). So it is not very likely that missing of values will have caused important bias.\nMultivariate analysis\nThe final multivariate model (Table 3) contains a total of nine variables, three variables concerning masks and none concerning glasses, gloves etc. We have tried to exchange the mask-variables for the other protection variables, but this dramatically worsened the model, so we conclude that wearing masks, of whatever design, is of the utmost importance to prevent infection. Also, emergency care experience and not taking training were selected as important predictors of getting SARS infection. Nose wash and taking prophylactic medicine turned out to be useful. Regarding contacts with patients, we found respiratory secretion and performing chest compression as important predictors.\n Multivariate analysis of factors significantly associated with SARS infection in healthcare workers\nVariable	OR	95% CI	P-value	 	Not wearing 16-layer cotton surgical mask	6.04	2.43-15.00	&lt;0.001	 	Not wearing 12-layer cotton surgical mask	4.54	1.62-12.74	0.004	 	Emergency care experience	2.97	1.26-6.96	0.013	 	Not performing nose wash	2.41	0.98-5.93	0.056	 	Contact: respiratory secretion	3.27	1.41-7.57	0.006	 	Not taking prophylactic medicine	2.77	1.10-6.98	0.031	 	Not taking training	2.40	1.08-5.31	0.039	 	Not wearing multiple layers of masks	2.44	1.03-5.77	0.026	 	Contact: chest compression	4.52	1.08-18.81	0.031	 	\nThe variables are shown in order of selection. No variables were excluded after selection, which means that a variable like '(Not) performing nose wash' is in the table, although it has a P-value &gt; 0.05 (it was &lt;0.05 when it was selected).\nThe correlations between seven predictor pairs are listed in Table 4. Training and contact date were shown to be correlated. Supplementary analysis showed that given taking training, contact date is not significant (P = 0.11), and given contact date, taking training is not significant. We therefore conclude that we cannot distinguish between these two variables. Contact with respiratory secretion was correlated with contact with sputum, but here we found that given secretion, sputum is not significant (P = 0.63), but given sputum, contact with secretion is clearly significant (P = 0.027). We therefore conclude that these variables are non-interchangeable: contact with respiratory secretion is the dangerous event. Chest compression and intubation were also highly correlated and we found that distinction between those two is not possible.\n Correlation analysis of significant factors in the univariate analyses of 1, 2. Only the significant correlations are shown\nVariable 1	Variable 2	Correlation coefficient	P-value	 	Contact: intubation 	Contact: chest compression 	0.201	&lt;0.001	 	Contact: respiratory secretion	Contact: sputum 	0.512	&lt;0.001	 	Contact: pathological specimens	Contact: deceased	0.091	0.047	 	Contact date 	Taking training 	0.167	0.001	 	Performing nose wash	Taking training	0.144	0.004	 	Wearing 12-layer cotton surgical mask	Wearing 16-layer cotton surgical mask	-0.510	&lt;0.001	 	Wearing glasses	Protective eyewear (goggle)	0.101	0.036	 	\n Factors that cannot be distinguished within the model.\n Factor excluded from the multivariate model, due to insignificant contribution in the presence of the correlating factor.\nDiscussion\nThe investigation was carried out in a hospital with a nosocomial outbreak of SARS. A total of 477 staff was recruited into the study, representing about 90% of HCWs exposed to SARS patients. The multivariate logistic regression finally disclosed three factors to be significantly associated with disease occurrence (i.e. performing chest compression or intubation, contact with respiratory secretion, emergency care experience), whereas six actions turned out to be protective (i.e. wearing 16-layer cotton surgical mask, wearing 12-layer cotton surgical mask, wearing multiple layers of masks, taking prophylactic medicine, nose wash and taking training). However, the effect of taking training cannot be distinguished from having been in contact with SARS patients late in the epidemic (after 2 April). Similarly, contact through performing chest compression and contact through intubation are interchangeable.\nOur study was subjected to a number of limitations. First, as in all retrospective surveys, recall bias was a concern. However, it is unlikely that ORs of this magnitude could result primarily from recall bias, since the associations shown are clear. The study was conducted shortly after the outbreak, thus minimising the information bias to which retrospective studies are otherwise susceptible. Another possible bias is that the case group attributed their infection to some high risky performance (e.g. performing intubation) and less efficient protection (wearing only one layer of mask while attending patients), while the control group did the opposite.\nDuring SARS epidemic in mainland China, all healthcare staff working in hospitals had been required to follow the recommended personal protection procedures. However, the risk of SARS infection, the level of precaution taken and the compliance with the standard largely depended on multiple factors, including the different time phases of patient contacts, different working areas and the various types of procedures performed. The outbreak in the hospital could be divided into two phases. In the early phase, there was a general lack of familiarity and training regarding infection-control measures among hospital staff. Medical wards and equipment were not adequately set up for the strict infection control standard. While in the later phase, after a super spreading event (SSE) occurred in the hospital, HCWs became more vigilant about protecting themselves from SARS transmission, which together with adequate training and infection control measures led to significant differences in the infection rate between subjects from before and after 2 April 2003, when the institutional infection control measures were established and enforced. We defined two phases of contact with SARS using the date of 2 April as the divide. As found in univariate analysis, early contact with SARS patients increased the ORs of SARS infection significantly. For the different working areas the univariate analysis did not show significant difference of the distributions between the case and control group.\nIn multivariate analysis, history of contact with respiratory secretion from an infected patient was associated with 3.27-fold increased ORs of infection for the attending HCWs. This is consistent with previous findings (Teleman et al. 2004), thus adding to the evidence that contact with respiratory secretions is an important risk factor. Certain types of procedures have been shown to be high-risk because they can lead to extensive spreading of droplets from the patient, for example, the use of the jet nebulizer and intubation and assisted ventilation (CDC 2003a; Ofner et al. 2003; Fowler et al. 2004). Our study found a significant association of infection with performing chest compression; while performing intubation showed significant correlation with the former, we cannot distinguish between these two variables given multivariate logistic regression, so both might act as factors that enhance the probability of SARS infection. However, Lau et al. (2004) showed that performing particular high-risk procedures on SARS patients was not considered to increase the disease risk. This might be due to the different types of procedures considered and inadequate sample size.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV infection is thought to occur primarily by either contact or large respiratory droplet transmission (CDC 2003b; Ruan et al. 2003). The effectiveness of protective measures of using masks, gloves, gowns, and hand-washing, recommended under 'droplet precautions' when caring for SARS patients, was also investigated for their protection effect. Some studies show that use of any mask was associated with lower ORs of infection in healthcare-related clusters (Ruan et al. 2003; Seto et al. 2003; Nishiura et al. 2005). One study showed that consistent use of an N95 mask was more protective than not wearing a mask or consistent use of a surgical mask (Loeb et al. 2004). In our study, wearing a 16-layer cotton surgical mask or 12-layer surgical mask, as well as multiple layers of masks, reduced the risk of infection. However, this does not mean that the higher-level protective masks, e.g. the N95 mask, cannot cause effective protection. The counting of N95 mask use was not large enough to give a significant P-value. This might pose an important limitation leading to the failure to detect an effect, even though it may be there. The factor using more than one layer of masks was shown to be more protective than a single layer, which presents strong evidence that necessary and appropriate face protection should be advised to diminish the risk of droplet infection. The adoption of 16-layer and 12-layer cotton surgical masks individually was shown to be highly effective on risk reduction and therefore should be recommended accordingly.\nWearing glasses is not intended as protection, yet it indeed showed significant protective effect in univariate analysis. This, together with the significant results of wearing goggles as shown in univariate analysis, might confirm the crucial role of eye protection, although both factors were not confirmed in the subsequent multivariate analysis. These findings fit well with droplets transmission because droplets are generated at the face level, making the mask and eye protection necessary for protection.\nThe finding that wearing of gowns and gloves achieved statistical significance in univariate, but not in multivariate analysis, differs from the previous studies, where neither gloves nor gowns were found to be protective (Varia et al. 2003; Teleman et al. 2004). In the study by Seto et al. (2003) in Hong Kong, however, gowns were found to be protective, although protection from gloves also failed to achieve statistical significance. In our final multivariate model, we explicitly tested the hypothesis that inclusion of mask over gowns and gloves was due to change but were strengthened in confidence by the fact that exchange of one set of predictors for the other seriously distorted the model. So the failure of inclusion of gowns and gloves was due to their insufficient contribution to the multivariate logistic model. However, wearing of gloves or gowns should never be downplayed because of the insignificant P-value in multivariate analysis. It should be noted that the effect of protective measures might be enhanced by beforehand training on infection control knowledge. In both univariate and multivariate analysis, the infection control training was significantly associated with lower risk of infection and also showed significant interaction with wearing multiple layers of masks. The latter finding had also been suggested in a previous study (Lau et al. 2004).\nAlthough several risk factors and protective measures have been identified, we should judge them in relation to the two exposure phases. During the early phase, HCWs in the hospital did not fully acknowledge the risk of the exposure to patients, and adequate personal protective equipments were not applied. The performance of endotracheal intubation and chest compression also helped to disseminate infected aerosol widely to a large number of patients and staff on the ward. This happened a lot during emergency care. During the latter phase, when the workers realised that they were dealing with a high risk infectious disease, they started to use personal protective equipment; however, due to general lack of familiarity and training regarding infection-control measures among the working staff, the protective measures were not administered adequately while dealing with SARS patients. This might explain to some extent that even after protective measures were implemented, there remained hospital workers that contracted the infection.\nThe high degree of correlation in the risky and protective procedures makes it difficult to ascertain which type of activity is most important for SARS infection, e.g. performing chest compression and performing intubation cannot be distinguished for their contribution to the multivariate model. The same applies to taking training and contact data (after 2 April). Thus, we should be aware that these types of personal risk and protective activities definitely played role in the disease occurrence, although they could not be identified as such in the stepwise multivariate model. We also believe that, whereas this study accepted the current factors as significant using a P-value &lt; 0.05, other risk and protective factors for disease infection exist, which we failed to elucidate in this study.\nIn summary, this study identified exposure to high-risk procedures (such as chest compression), and contact with respiratory secretions to be significant risk factors for SARS infection among HCWs in a hospital in Beijing. These results also provide confirmation that personal protective measures against droplet spread, such as wearing multiple layers of mask, are effective against the nosocomial spread of SARS. This knowledge may help prepare public health officials and clinicians for a reappearance of SARS, should it occur, or for the emergence of another comparable infectious disease. All HCWs should remain vigilant to evaluate and improve their infection-control practices to limit possible future outbreaks of SARS and SARS-like other nosocomial outbreaks). From the administrative point of the hospital, teaching and training of the medical profession in infectious diseases and the capacity of the public health sector to deal with these diseases must be strengthened.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors have declared no conflicts of interest.\n Correction added after online publication &lt;July 13 2009&gt;: Reference Ma et al reference added.\nReferences\nCluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome cases among protected health-care workers:Toronto, Canada, April 2003\nOutbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome:worldwide\nOutbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: case report\nThe SARS epidemic in mainland China: bringing together all epidemiological data Tropical Medicine of International Health\nTransmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome during intubation and mechanical ventilation\nSARS transmission among hospital workers in Hong Kong\nTwo-year prospective study of the humoral immune response of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome\nSARS among critical care nurses, Toronto\nA case-control study on the risk factors of severe acute respiratory syndromes among health care workers\nRapid awareness and transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hanoi French Hospital, Vietnam\nCluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome cases among protected health care workers-Toronto 2003\nComparative full-length genome sequence analysis of 14 SARS coronavirus isolates and common mutations associated with putative origins of infection\nEffectiveness of precautions against droplets and contact in prevention of nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nFactors associated with transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome among health-care workers in Singapore\nInvestigation of a nosocomial outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto, Canada\nCase definitions for surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) \nEvidence of airborne transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome cases among protected health-care workers:Toronto, Canada, April 2003","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome:worldwide","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome:worldwide, 2003","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) updated interim case definition","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cumulative number of reported cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Case definitions for surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A cluster of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.

Eight of 32 nurses who entered a SARS patient's room were infected. The probability of SARS infection was 6% per shift worked. Assisting during intubation, suctioning before intubation, and manipulating the oxygen mask were high-risk activities. Consistently wearing a mask (either surgical or particulate respirator type N95) while caring for a SARS patient was protective for the nurses, and consistent use of the N95 mask was more protective than not wearing a mask. Risk was reduced by consistent use of a surgical mask, but not significantly. Risk was lower with consistent use of a N95 mask than with consistent use of a surgical mask. We conclude that activities related to intubation increase SARS risk and use of a mask (particularly a N95 mask) is protective.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first recognized in Canada in early March 2003. Caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, the disease was reported in more than 8,400 people globally, with cases in Asia, Europe, and North America in 2003. SARS is associated with substantial illness and death. The case-fatality rate has been estimated at 13% for patients &lt;60 years and 43% for those &gt;60 years. In Canada, disease transmission has occurred predominantly among healthcare workers within the healthcare setting. Preventing SARS transmission to healthcare workers is therefore an important priority.\nLittle is known about SARS risk factors for healthcare workers. Determining patient care activities that pose a high risk for infection and possible protective measures for healthcare workers may inform strategies for prevention and may elucidate SARS transmission. Recommended protective equipment for healthcare workers caring for patients with SARS includes a particulate respirator mask (N95) and a goggle or face shield, gown, and gloves. One report from Hong Kong has suggested that surgical and N95 masks are protective (9), but few data exist to support the recommendations.\nSARS poses a special challenge for healthcare workers who care for the critically ill. Many SARS patients are in critical care units. In a Toronto case series, 29 (20%) of 144 SARS patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 20 (69%) of these 29 received mechanical ventilation. The close interaction of staff and patients and the nature of invasive patient care activities, such as intubation and other procedures that involve potential exposure to respiratory secretions, raise important questions about the risk for healthcare workers working in critical care units.\nTo determine risk factors for SARS, we conducted a retrospective cohort study among nurses who worked in two critical care units in a Toronto hospital. We hypothesized that patient care activities (e.g., intubating, suctioning of endotracheal tubes, and administering nebulizers) that increase exposure to respiratory droplets are associated with an increased risk for SARS transmission and that masks protect against infection.\nMethods\nStudy Setting and Population\nHospital A is a 256-bed community hospital that provides medical, surgical, obstetric, and pediatric care in the Greater Toronto Area. On March 7, 2003, the 42-year-old son (patient A) of the index patient in the Toronto SARS outbreak was seen in the emergency department. He was admitted to the hospital's 10-bed ICU on March 8. Patient A stayed in the ICU until March 13, the date of his death due to SARS. On March 17, a 77-year-old man (patient B) who had been exposed to patient A in the emergency room on March 7 was admitted to the ICU. He stayed there until his death due to SARS on March 21. Patient C, another emergency room contact of Patient A, was admitted to the hospital's 15-bed coronary care unit (CCU) on March 13. On March 16, he was transferred to another hospital's ICU, where he stayed until his death from SARS on March 29. Nurses who worked one or more shifts in hospital A's ICU from March 8 to 13 and from March 17 to 21 (i.e., when a SARS patient was in the unit) were included in the cohort. Similarly, nurses who worked one or more shifts from March 14 to March 16 in hospital A's CCU were included.\nMeasurements\nWe recorded the age, sex, and medical history of the nursing staff, including history of any respiratory illness, smoking, conditions that might result in immunosuppression, and use of immunosuppressive medications. Using a standardized data collection form, trained research nurses abstracted information regarding the patient care activities administered by the critical care nurses. To link particular nurses to activities performed in SARS patients' rooms, we identified nurses' signatures on patient charts by using a master list of signatures provided by the CCUs. Data collection included type and duration of patient care activities performed. The types of personal protection equipment (goggles, face shield, surgical mask, glove, gown, N95 mask) and the duration and frequency of using the equipment when caring for SARS patients were recorded. Information from the charts was then used to interview nurses about the specific care provided during their shifts. Information provided by the nurses was corroborated whenever possible by data from the charts.\nCase Definition\nWe used Health Canada's case definition for suspected or probable SARS cases. A suspected case was described as fever (&gt;38  C), cough or breathing difficulty, and one or more of the following exposures during the 10 days before onset of symptoms: close contact with a person with suspected or probable SARS, recent travel to an area with recent local SARS transmission outside Canada, recent travel or visit to an identified setting in Canada where SARS exposure might have occurred. A probable case was defined as a suspected SARS case with radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome or a suspected SARS case with autopsy findings consistent with pathologic features of respiratory distress syndrome without identifiable cause. The case definitions are in accordance with the World Health Organization's clinical case definitions. All three source patients met the definition for probable SARS cases. For this study, we assessed outcomes for each nurse from the first exposure to a source patient until 10 days (one incubation period) after the last exposure (March 8-April 3 for nurses in ICU and March 14-26 for nurses in CCU). Nurses who met the suspected or probable case definition and the three SARS source patients (patients A, B, and C) were tested for antibodies against SARS-associated coronavirus by immunofluorescence (EUROIMMUN, Luebeck, Germany).\nStatistical Analysis\nFischer's exact two-sided tests were used to assess risk factors. Exact confidence intervals (CI) were reported. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was constructed. Data were analyzed by using EpiInfo 2000 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) and SAS version 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\nResults\nForty-three nurses worked at least one shift in a critical care unit where there was a patient with SARS; 37 worked in ICU and 6 in CCU. Eight nurses were infected with SARS, four who worked only in the ICU, three who worked only in the CCU, and one ICU nurse who worked one shift in the CCU. All cohort nurses were female; the mean age was 41 years (range 27-65 years). Only two nurses had a history of respiratory illness (one asthma, one bronchitis). Illness onset for the eight nurses was March 16-21. The most common symptoms included fever (8 [100%] of 8), myalgia (7 [87.5%] of 8), cough (6 [75%] of 8) and chills (6 [75%] of 8). Five nurses (62.5%) had headaches, and four (50%) had shortness of breath. Of the eight nurses, four (probable SARS case-patients) had unilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph and four (suspected SARS case-patients) had normal chest radiographs. SARS diagnosis in these eight nurses and in the three SARS source patients was confirmed by serology.\nPatient Care Activities\nRelative infection risk for 23 patient care activities is shown in Table 1. None of the 11 nurses who did not enter a SARS patient's room became ill. Our analysis was thus limited to the 32 nurses who entered a SARS patient's room at least once. Three patient care activities were associated with SARS infection: intubating (relative risk [RR] 4.20, 95% CI 1.58 to 11.14, p = 0.04); suctioning before intubation (4.20 RR, 95% CI 1.58 to 11.14, p = 0.04); and manipulating an oxygen mask (9.0 RR, 95% CI 1.25 to 64. 9, p &lt;= 0.01).\nRelative risk of critical care nurses acquiring SARS by patient care activitya\nPatient care activity	SARS attack rate : (No. cases/No. exposed or unexposed) (%)	Relative risk (95% CI)	p value	 	Exposed	Unexposed	 	Intubation	3/4 (75)	5/28 (18)	4.20 (1.58 to 11.14)	0.04	 	Suctioning before intubation	3/4 (75)	5/28 (18)	4.20 (1.58 to 11.14)	0.04	 	Suctioning after intubation	4/19(21)	4/13(31)	0.68 (0.21 to 2.26)	0.04	 	Nebulizer treatment	3/5(20)	5/27 (8)	3.24 (1.11 to 9.42)	0.09	 	Manipulation of oxygen mask	7/14 (50)	1/18 (6)	9.00 (1.25 to 64.89)	0.01	 	Manual ventilation	2/7 (29)	6/25 (24)	1.19 (0.30 to 4.65)	1.00	 	Mouth or dental care	5/21 (24)	3/11(27)	0.87 (0.25 to 2.99)	1.00	 	Insertion of a nasogastric tube	2/6 (33)	6/26 (23)	1.44 (0.38 to 5.47)	0.62	 	Insertion of an indwelling urinary catheter	2/2 (100)	6/30(0.20)	5.00 (2.44 to 10.23)	0.06	 	Insertion of a peripheral intravenous catheter	3/5 (60)	5/27 (19)	3.24 (1.11 to 9.42)	0.09	 	Chest tube insertion or removal	0 (0)	0 (0)			 	Insertion of a central venous catheter	2/6 (33)	6/26 (23)	1.44 (0.38 to 5.47)	0.62	 	Bathing or patient transfer	7/26 (27)	1/6 (17)	1.62 (0.24 to 10.78)	1.00	 	Manipulation of BiPAP mask	3/6 (50)	5/26 (19)	2.60 (0.8 to 7.99)	0.15	 	Administration of medication	5/23 (22)	3/ 9 (33)	0.65 (0.20 to 2.18)	0.65	 	Performing an electrocardiogram	4/12 (33)	4/20 (20)	1.67 (0.51 to 5.46)	0.43	 	Venipuncture	6/17 (35)	2/ 15 (13)	2.65 (0.63 to 11.19)	0.23	 	Manipulation of commodes or bedpans	3/5 (60)	5/ 27 (19)	3.24 (1.11 to 9.42)	0.09	 	Feeding	2/10 (20)	6/22 (27)	0.73 (0.18 to 3.02)	1.00	 	Debrillation	0/2 (0)	8/ 30 (0.27)		1.00	 	Cardiopulmonary resuscitation	0/3 (0)	8/29 (28)		0.55	 	Chest physiotherapy	2/7 (29)	6/25 (0.24)	1.19 (0.30 to 4.65)	1.00	 	Assessment of patient	6/ 23 (26)	2/ 9 (22)	1.17 (0.29 to 4.77)	1.00	 	Insertion of peripheral intravenous line	1/1 (100)	7/31 (23)	4.43 (2.31 to 8.50)	0.25	 	Endotracheal aspirate	3/12 (25)	5/ 20 (25)	1.00 (0.29 to 3.45)	1.00	 	Bronchoscopy	1/2 (50)	7/ 30 (23)	2.14 (0.46 to 9.90)	0.44	 	Radiology procedures	4/15(26)	4/17 (24)	1.13 (0.34 to 3.76)	1.00	 	Dressing change	1/6 (17)	7/26 (27)	0.62 (0.09 to 4.13)	1.00	 	Urine specimen collected	1/2 (50)	7/30 (23)	2.14 (0.46 to 9.90)	0.44	 	Fecal specimen collected	0/1 (0)	8/31(26)		1.00	 	Rectal swab obtained	0/1 (0)	8/31 (26)		1.00	 	Nasopharyngeal swab obtained	0/2 (0)	8/30 (27)		1.00	 	Other	2/5 (40)	6/27 (22)	1.80 (0.50 to 6.50)	0.58	 	\naSARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; CI, confidence interval\nPersonal Protective Equipment\nUse of personal protective equipment and history of high-risk patient care activities among SARS-infected nurses are summarized in Table 2. Relative risk for SARS infection and use of personal protective equipment is summarized in Table 3. Three (13%) of 23 nurses who consistently wore a mask (either surgical or N95) acquired SARS compared to 5 (56%) of 9 nurses who did not consistently wear a mask (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.78, p = 0.02). The RR for infection was 0.22 (95%CI 0.05 to 0.93, p = 0.06) when nurses who always wore an N95 mask (2 SARS-infected and 14 noninfected nurses) were compared with nurses who did not wear any mask (N95 or surgical mask) consistently (5 SARS-infected and 4 noninfected nurses). The RR for infection was 0.45 (95%CI 0.07 to 2.71, p = 0.56) when nurses who always wore a surgical mask (one SARS-infected and three noninfected nurses) were compared with nurses who did not wear any mask (N95 or surgical mask) consistently (five SARS-infected and four for non-SARS nurses). The difference in RR for SARS infection for nurses who consistently wore N95 masks and those who consistently wore surgical masks was not significant (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.23, p = 0.5).\nSummary of exposure, personal protective equipment, and participation in high-risk activities of the nurses in whom SARS developeda\nNurse	No. of shifts	Location of shift	Total duration of exposure to index patientb (min)	Personal protection used when inside SARS patient's room	Participation in high risk activitiesc	 	1	3	ICU	60	Gown : Gloves : Surgical mask		 	2	3	ICU	385	Gown : Gloves : N95 : Gogglesd	Intubation, suctioning before intubation	 	3	3	ICUe	190	Gownd : Glovesd : N95d	Suctioning before intubation	 	4	5	ICU	935	Gloves : Gownd : Gogglesd : N95d	Intubation, suctioning before intubation	 	5	3	ICU	555	Gloves : Gown : N95 : Gogglesd	Intubation	 	6	2	CCU	510	None		 	7	2	CCU	40	None		 	8	2	CCU	510	Glovesd		 	\naSARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; ICU, intensive care unit; CCU, coronary care unit. : bDuration of exposure is defined as time spent in a SARS patient's room. : cIntubation, suctioning before intubation. : dIndicates that use of this precaution was inconsistent (was not used on one or more occasions). : eNurse 3 worked one shift in coronary care unit.\nNurses' risk of acquiring SARS based on use of personal protective equipmenta\nType of personal protective equipment	Attack rate (%) according to personal protective equipment used	Relative risk (95% CI)	2-Tailed Fisher exact p value	 	Consistent	Inconsistent	 	Gown	3/20 (15)	5/12 (42)	0.36 (0.10 to 1.24)	0.12	 	Gloves	4/22 (18)	4/10 (40)	0.45 (0.14 to 1.46)	0.22	 	N95 or surgical mask	3/23 (13)	5/9 (56)	0.23 (0.07 to 0.78)	0.02	 	N95a	2/16 (13)	5/9 (56)	0.22 (0.05 to 0.93)	0.06	 	Surgical maskb	1/4 (25)	5/9 (56)	0.45 (0.07 to 2.71)	0.56	 	N95 versus surgical maskc	2/16 (13)	1/4 (25)	0.50 (0.06 to 4.23)	0.51	 	\naSARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; CI, confidence interval. : bThe comparator is use of no mask.

The figure demonstrates onset of symptoms by number of shifts worked. It shows that if all nurses had worked eight shifts, 53% of them would become infected with SARS. The probability of SARS infection was 6% (8/143) per shift worked.\nOnset of symptoms for severe acute respiratory syndrome by number of shifts worked (dashed lines represent 95% confidence limits).\nDiscussion\nWe found that critical care nurses who assisted with suctioning before intubation and intubation of SARS patients were four times more likely to become infected than nurses who did not. Manipulation of a SARS patient's oxygen mask was also a high-risk factor. Our findings support reports that exposure to respiratory secretions or activities that generate aerosols can result in SARS transmission to healthcare workers.\nThe 11 nurses in our study who did not enter a SARS patient's room did not become infected. This finding, along with the finding that respiratory care activities pose high risk, implicates either droplet or limited aerosol generation as a means of transmission to healthcare workers. The finding is compatible with the relative high risk (6% per shift worked) of critical care nurses. Our results did not implicate environmental transmission (i.e., contact through gowns) as a major risk factor. These data are in keeping with the report by Scales and colleagues, in which activities associated with droplet or limited aerosol spread were implicated as important sources of transmission.\nWe found a near 80% reduction in risk for infection for nurses who consistently wore masks (either surgical or N95). This finding is similar to that of Seto and colleagues, who found that both surgical masks and N95 masks were protective against SARS among healthcare workers in Hong Kong hospitals. When we compared use of N95 to use of surgical masks, the relative SARS risk associated with the N95 mask was half that for the surgical mask; however, because of the small sample size, the result was not statistically significant. Our data suggest that the N95 mask offers more protection than a surgical mask.\nThis study focused on critical care nurses working at the first SARS hospital outbreak in Toronto. Since use of personal protective equipment was not standardized during the study period, it was possible to assess the effect of personal protective equipment. The use of personal protective equipment was highly variable because the nurses were often unaware that their patients had SARS. Our results highlight the importance of using personal protective equipment when caring for SARS patients. We estimate that if the entire cohort had used masks consistently, SARS risk would have been reduced from 6% to 1.4% per shift.\nA limitation of this study is that it is retrospective. Recall bias on the part of the critical care nurses is a possibility. We believe that by verifying the information provided (e.g., patient care activities) using medical records, and using the medical records to cue the interviewed nurses, we minimized recall bias. Any prospective evaluation (e.g., using an observer in ICU) after the initial outbreak would have been limited by uniformity in use of personal protective equipment (i.e., use of N95 masks, gowns, gloves, goggles). We acknowledge that the study cohort was small, and this limits inferences that can be made. Nevertheless, these data support current recommendations for use of N95 masks and for special precautions when performing intubations on SARS patients.\nSuggested citation for this article: Loeb M, McGeer A, Henry B, Ofner M, Rose D, Hlywka T, et al.

Considerable controversy resulted regarding which procedures and behaviours were associated with the greatest risk of SARS-CoV transmission.\nMethods\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV during intubation from laboratory confirmed SARS patients to HCWs involved in their care. All SARS patients requiring intubation during the Toronto outbreak were identified. All HCWs who provided care to intubated SARS patients during treatment or transportation and who entered a patient room or had direct patient contact from 24 hours before to 4 hours after intubation were eligible for this study. Data was collected on patients by chart review and on HCWs by interviewer-administered questionnaire. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression models and classification and regression trees (CART) were used to identify risk factors for SARS transmission.\nResults\n45 laboratory-confirmed intubated SARS patients were identified. Of the 697 HCWs involved in their care, 624 (90%) participated in the study. SARS-CoV was transmitted to 26 HCWs from 7 patients; 21 HCWs were infected by 3 patients. In multivariate GEE logistic regression models, presence in the room during fiberoptic intubation (OR = 2.79, p = .004) or ECG (OR = 3.52, p = .002), unprotected eye contact with secretions (OR = 7.34, p = .001), patient APACHE II score &gt;=20 (OR = 17.05, p = .009) and patient Pa02/Fi02 ratio &lt;=59 (OR = 8.65, p = .001) were associated with increased risk of transmission of SARS-CoV. In CART analyses, the four covariates which explained the greatest amount of variation in SARS-CoV transmission were covariates representing individual patients.\nConclusion\nClose contact with the airway of severely ill patients and failure of infection control practices to prevent exposure to respiratory secretions were associated with transmission of SARS-CoV. Rates of transmission of SARS-CoV varied widely among patients.\nIntroduction\nOn March 7, 2003, a son of Canada's index SARS case was admitted to a hospital in Toronto with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Because he and other family members were not identified as infected with SARS CoV until March 13, infection was transmitted to patients, volunteers, visitors and health care workers in this community hospital, and subsequently in other hospitals and the community throughout Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Over the next three months, SARS-CoV would be transmitted to 375 persons in Toronto, 271 (72%) of whom acquired their infections in health care settings. The healthcare workers at greatest risk of acquiring SARS were those caring for critically ill SARS patients, and transmission was documented despite the use of recommended personal protective equipment.  \nDuring and after the outbreak, considerable controversy evolved regarding how HCWs using precautions became infected, and what care activities and/or behaviours posed the greatest risk of transmission. We conducted a retrospective cohort study designed to identify risk factors associated with transmission of SARS-CoV from patients requiring intubation to HCWs involved in their care. In particular, we wanted to assess the risk of SARS-CoV transmission associated with adherence to infection control precautions and with performance of &quot;high-risk&quot; procedures in a setting in which adjustment for potential patient-related characteristics was possible.\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nPatient clinical details were obtained through review of health records which was conducted for a study of clinical presentation and management of SARS. The study was approved by the IRB of each hospital where patients were treated. Individual consents were not obtained which is the practice for chart review studies in which individual patient identifying information is not required. All patients in the SARS outbreak were given a unique identifying number and all data were coded with this unique number. There was no information collected that could identify the patient personally.\nHCWs blood samples were obtained through a seroprevalence study, which was part of the public health investigation and received IRB approval at each hospital where HCWs were enrolled. HCWs provided consent for blood samples.\nApprovals for both studies were obtained from The Mount Sinai Hospital Research Ethics Board as well as the Research Ethics Boards/Committees of the following institutions: Sunnybrook Health Center. North York General Hospital, The Scarborough Hospital, Rouge Valley Health Care, Humber River Regional Hospital, Markham Stuffily Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital, St. Joseph's Health Center, Southlake Regional Health Center, Toronto East General Hospital, University Health Center, and Lakeridge Health Center.\nHCWs were interviewed as part of a public health investigation into the transmission of SARS-CoV. HCWs were invited to participate and consent was implied by willingness of HCWs to be interviewed about their experiences. No IRB approval was required as these interviews occurred as part of the public health outbreak investigation which is a legislated responsibility of the Ontario public health units.\nIdentification and Classification of Patients and HCWs\nPatients\nSARS patients requiring intubation were identified by reviewing outbreak line lists from the Province of Ontario, local public health units, and hospitals. All cases in the Toronto outbreak who met the clinical and epidemiologic criteria for SARS and who required intubation were included. Clinical criteria for SARS included fever &gt;38 C, one or more respiratory symptoms, radiological evidence of pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome and no alternative diagnosis; or having an unexplained acute respiratory illness resulting in death between March 5, 2003 and June 12, 2003. Epidemiological criteria included: visiting a setting that was associated with a SARS cluster or having cared for, lived with or had face-to-face contact with a person known to have SARS in the 10 days prior to onset of symptoms.\nAll patients in whom SARS was suspected had multiple clinical specimens tested by culture and PCR for SARS-CoV, including nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, sputum/endotracheal secretions, conjunctival swabs, stool, urine and, if available, bronchoalveolar lavage and post-mortem lung and other tissue samples. If possible, acute and convalescent serum were also obtained. Patients were classified as laboratory confirmed, probable, unclassifiable or not a case of SARS-associated coronavirus (CoV) disease, based on laboratory testing. Laboratory confirmed cases were those with SARS-CoV antibodies detected in serum obtained after the onset of symptoms by tests conducted in two different reference laboratories, SARS CoV isolated by cell culture from a clinical and/or autopsy specimen, SARS-CoV RNA detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from an autopsy specimen with compatible histological findings, or SARS-CoV RNA detected by RT-PCR from at least two different specimens by two different reference laboratories. Probable cases were those in whom a convalescent serum specimen was not available for testing and other laboratory criteria for SARS were not met, but who had clinically compatible disease and at least one household contact who was a laboratory confirmed case of SARS. Cases were unclassifiable if they did not meet criteria for laboratory confirmed disease, and either had no household contacts, or contacts without laboratory confirmed disease. Patients were classified as not having SARS if antibodies to SARS-CoV could not be detected in serum obtained more than 28 days after symptom onset.\nHCWs\nAll HCWs who provided care to intubated SARS patients during treatment or transportation, or who entered the room of such patients from 24 hours prior to intubation until 4 hours after intubation were eligible for this study, and approached for consent to participate. They were identified by review of patient charts, work schedules, assignments and on-call schedules, and by asking individuals being interviewed to recall which other staff members were present.\nWe reviewed outbreak line lists and interviewed HCWs to identify those with fever or respiratory symptoms with onset from 1 to 14 days after each work shift with identified patients. Participating HCWs were also asked to submit a convalescent serum sample for SARS-CoV antibody testing. HCWs were classified as SARS if they had antibodies to SARS-CoV detected in their convalescent serum, or if they met the SARS outbreak case definition and did not have serology performed. They were classified as not having SARS if they had negative serology or if they did not have serology done and had no fever or respiratory symptoms. They were deemed unclassifiable if they had SARS compatible symptoms that did not meet the case definition and convalescent serology was not available.\nStaff were asked about their history of travel to areas affected by SARS, care provided to any possible SARS patients, and household and other contact with potential SARS cases, including other HCWs. For symptomatic HCWs, we recorded potential exposures in the period from 24 hours to 12 days before onset of illness using outbreak contact tracing data, interviews and work assignments. For HCWs who were SARS-CoV seropositive without symptoms, we reviewed all potential exposures which occurred during the outbreak period.\nA high risk exposure to SARS was defined as being in the same room as or involved in the transport of a SARS patient either during the 24 hours prior to the patient requiring intubation, or at any time when adequate precautions had not been implemented. Adequate precautions were defined as the patient being in a negative pressure room and gown, gloves, mask (surgical mask or, N95 or higher respirator) and eye protection (goggles, safety glasses or face shield) being worn.\nCohorts for analysis\nThe primary analysis was restricted to patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS, and HCWs who were either asymptomatic or had laboratory confirmed disease and whose only high risk exposure was contact with intubated patients. A secondary analysis included probable and laboratory confirmed SARS patients and all infected HCWs. Because there were no significant differences between the two analyses, only the results of the primary analysis are presented here.\nMeasurements\nPatients\nA standardized data collection form was used for chart review, and included: age, sex, underlying chronic conditions, date of symptom onset, duration of illness at the time of intubation, date of hospital and ICU admission, date of discharge, outcome; documented vomiting, diarrhea, incontinence, agitation, and combativeness during the 24 hours prior to intubation, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score during the same period (APACHE II), lowest PaO2 to FiO2 (P/F ratio) ratio during the first 24 hours in the ICU and maximum inspired oxygen requirement (FiO2) on the second day of hospital admission. We also recorded whether attending physicians suspected that the patient had SARS at the time of intubation.\nDetails of the intubation procedures were obtained from medical records and interviews with the staff member who performed the intubation. These included: method of intubation (fiber optic, laryngoscopic, nasopharyngeal, or tracheotomy), patient combativeness, number of attempts required, experience of person performing the procedure, and whether manual intubation was required before and/or after intubation. Intubations were classified as difficult if more than one attempt was required, if fiber optic visualization or any adjuvant device for difficult airway was required, or if the patient was combative. HCWs performing intubations were considered experienced if they had more than three years of experience and performed more than one intubation per month, or if they had more than one year of experience and performed more than one intubation per week.\nProcedures and activities performed during the defined exposure period were documented. These included: airway management procedures (oxygen therapy, bronchoscopy, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, manual ventilation, suctioning, type of mechanical ventilation, nebulizer treatment) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation and other care activities (chest x-ray; electrocardiogram; chest tube insertion; insertion of central venous, peripheral or arterial catheters; insertion of urinary catheter or nasogastric tube; collection of blood, urine, stool, or sputum samples).\nHCWs\nA structured questionnaire was administered to HCWs through a face-to-face interview or by telephone interview if a respondent was in quarantine or had left their job. HCWs were asked about occupation, years of experience in their current occupation, age, sex, history of smoking and underlying chronic conditions.\nAll non-demographic variables were assessed separately for each eligible shift. An eligible shift was defined as one in which a HCW provided care for one patient during that patient's defined exposure period. When HCWs worked two shifts during one exposure period, data from these two shifts were combined for the analysis.\nFor each shift, questions were asked about the number of room entries, cumulative time spent in a patient room, and type and duration of contact with a patient. We also assessed level of involvement (performed, assisted or observed) in and the amount of time the HCW spent in the patient's room during 34 patient care activities, as well as the HCW's presence in the patient's room while the patient was receiving non-invasive ventilation, oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation. Copies of charts were provided to interviewees to assist in recall.\nType of personal protection equipment (PPE) -gloves, gown, goggles or face shield, surgical mask, N95 or higher respirator, and frequency of its use (never, sometimes, most of the time and always) during the shift were assessed. We also asked about PPE use separately during involvement in patient care activities and categorized HCWs' sequence of removal of PPE based on the potential risk of self-contamination of mucous membranes.  \nParticipants were asked whether they had received SARS-specific infection control training prior to their eligible shift. Infection control training was categorized as active (face-to-face teaching) or passive (written instructions only). Exposure incidents that occurred during the eligible shift were recorded, including needle stick injuries and exposure of skin or mucous membranes to patient's body fluids, blood, secretions or mucous membranes.\nLaboratory tests\nLaboratory testing was conducted in collaboration with the Ontario Laboratory Working Group for the Rapid Diagnosis of Emerging Diseases, the Central Ontario Public Health Laboratory, the SARS autopsy investigation, the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, and the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory. Detection of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV was performed by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescent assay (IFA) as previously described.  \nStatistical Methods\nDemographic and clinical characteristics were summarized with counts and percentages for categorical variables and with medians and interquartile ranges for ordinal and continuous variables. These characteristics were compared between patients who did and did not transmit SARS-CoV and between HCWs who did and did not develop SARS with chi square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for ordinal and continuous variables.\nTwo statistical methods were used to identify factors associated with SARS-CoV transmission: Classification and regression trees (CART) and Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models. CART is a non-parametric method of identifying predictor variables by using binary recursive partitioning: subsets of patients are formed by examining each possible cut point of each variable to identify the cut point that resulted in maximum discrimination between subgroups of patients with respect to the probability of acquiring SARS. CART analyses were conducted twice: with and without allowing patient specific covariates to be predictor variables.\nGEE logistic regression models were used to identify predictor variables while adjusting for correlation among responses from HCWs caring for the same patient. Correlation within HCW shifts caring for a single patient was assumed to follow the exchangeable correlation structure. Correlation among shifts worked by the same HCW was not modeled. Covariates which had a p value &lt;0.10 in univariate GEE logistic regression models were considered as candidates for entry into the multivariable GEE model.\nResults\nFifty-six (15%) of 360 SARS patients who received treatment in one of 20 Ontario hospitals required intubation. Eleven patients were excluded from the primary analysis: seven had probable SARS, one patient was unclassifiable and three patients had at least one specimen positive by PCR, but did not have detectable antibodies to SARS CoV at &gt;=28 days after symptom onset. Thus, 45 patients were classified as having laboratory confirmed SARS and were included in the primary analysis as potential index cases for the exposed HCWs.\nOverall, 624 (90%) of 697 HCWs who were identified as having provided care to the 45 laboratory confirmed SARS patients consented to participate, could be classified as having had SARS or not, and had no other high risk exposures. They worked a total of 786 eligible shifts. Interviews were completed at a median of 4.2 months (range 0.2-10 months) after the eligible shift. 111 (17.8%) HCWs were involved in the care of more than one intubated SARS patient, with a maximum of 8 eligible patients cared for by the same HCW. The median number of participating HCWs involved in the care of each SARS patient during the relevant time period (24 hours prior to intubation until 4 hours post-intubation) was 15 (range 6 to 30).\nOf the 624 participating HCWs, 26 contracted SARS; all survived and none required intubation. SARS-CoV transmission to HCWs was attributable to 7 of the 45 laboratory confirmed SARS patients. Transmission to 22 HCWs could be definitively attributed to a single patient, with 6 patients transmitting to 1, 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 HCWs respectively. The remaining four HCWs who acquired SARS had cared for more than one SARS patient during the high risk period, making it difficult to precisely identify which patient was the source of infection. For the primary analysis, we assumed a 'most likely scenario' for assigning transmission to one patient. Three of the infected staff members cared for two patients whose intubations were a few hours apart. Since one patient was the source of infection for five other individuals; we assumed in the primary analysis that this patient had also transmitted SARS-CoV to these 3 HCWs. The fourth HCW was involved in the care of two intubated patients; transmission was assumed to have occurred on the shift that involved emergency intubation and cardiac resuscitation.\nNo patient characteristics were statistically significantly different between patients who did and did not transmit SARS-CoV (Table 1). HCWs who contracted SARS were more likely to be paramedics (p&lt;.01) and had less infection control training (p&lt;.009) than other workers (Table 2). They were less likely to always wear goggles (p&lt;0.01) or a gown (p = .02) while in the patient's room, and more likely to have used less effective methods of respiratory protection while in a patient's room (p = .04). They were more likely to have participated in administering non-invasive ventilation (p&lt;0.01), and to have performed ECGs (p&lt;0.01), fiber optic intubation (p&lt;0.01) or manual ventilation before intubation (p&lt;0.01) than HCWs who did not develop SARS (Table 3).\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of SARS patients requiring intubation in the Toronto outbreak by presence or

workers were considered exposed if they reported being in the room while the patient was receiving the therapy.\nFisher's exact test.\nIn the CART analysis allowing individual patients to be entered as covariates, patient covariates were the top four splitting variables according to the deviance at each node (Figure 1). Twenty-three of the 26 HCWs who acquired SARS were involved in the care of one of these four patients. The results of this analysis did not change when only HCWs with exposures to single patients were considered, or when we altered the assumptions regarding which patient infected the four HCWs with exposures to two patients. If patients were not included as predictor variables (Figure 2), then the first splitting variable was whether the patient P/F ratio was &gt;35.5 or &lt;35.5 (3% vs 42% contracted SARS). Among the 605 HCWs involved in the care of patients with P/F ratio &gt;35.5, the most predictive variable was whether or not the HCW wore eye protection (1% of HCWs infected wearing eye protection vs 8% infected not using eye protection). It should be noted that the single patient with P/F ratio &lt;35.5 was the patient who was the first splitting variable in the CART analysis with individual patients included.\nClassification and regression tree analysis of risk factors for SARS transmission, allowing patient-specific covariates.\nClassification and regression tree analysis of risk factors for SARS transmission, not allowing patient specific covariates.\nIn univariate GEE models (Table S1), patient characteristics associated with transmitting SARS-CoV were: P/F ratio &lt;=59, gender, death due to SARS, APACHE II score &gt;=20, presence of diarrhea within 24 hours of intubation, any chronic underlying illness disease, and diabetes mellitus (when underlying illnesses were considered separately). HCW characteristics associated with acquiring SARS included eye/mucous membrane exposure to blood/body fluids, performing intubation, and presence in the room for any of cardiac compressions, defibrillation, ECG, intubation, manual ventilation, manipulation of oxygen mask or tubing, collection of sputum or stool samples, or transporting the patient. In the multivariate GEE logistic regression model (Table 4), the independent predictors were eye or mucous membrane exposure to body fluids (OR = 7.34, p = .001), patient APACHE II score &gt;=20 (OR = 17.05, p = .0009), patient P/F ratio &lt;=59 (OR = 8.65, p = .001), presence during ECG (OR = 3.52, p = .002), and presence during intubation OR = 2.79, p = .004).\nMultivariate Generalized Estimating Equation logistic regression model of the probability of transmitting SARS from patient to health care worker.\nParameter	OR	95% CI	p value	 	HCW's eye/mucous membranes exposed to body fluids	7.34	(2.19, 24.52)	.001	 	Patient APACHE II score &gt;=20	17.05	(3.20, 90.75)	.009	 	HCW present during ECG	3.52	(1.58, 7.86)	.002	 	HCW present during intubation	2.79	(1.40, 5.58)	.004	 	Patient PaO2 to FiO2 ratio &lt;=59	8.65	(2.31, 32.36)	.001	 	\nHCW = health care worker.\nDiscussion\nThis study is the most detailed assessment to date of the risks of SARS acquisition associated with HCW involvement in medical procedures, their infection control practices and the demographic and clinical characteristics of SARS patients. Amongst this group of HCWs caring for SARS patients immediately prior to and during intubation, the strongest predictor of SARS transmission from patient to HCW was whether or not the patient under care was a &quot;superspreader&quot;. Twenty-three of the 26 HCWs who became infected with SARS were infected by four of 45 patients. Lack of adherence to infection control procedures was also associated with transmission of SARS-CoV; however, individual patient characteristics beyond superspreader status were not.\nThe substantial heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections created by each case for many sexually transmitted and vector-borne diseases has led to the general rule that 20% of patients are associated with 80% of new cases. Although heterogeneity in individual patient transmission in diseases spread by direct contact and respiratory droplets is less well recognized, it has been clearly described for measles, rubella, Staphylococcus aureus , and tuberculosis, as well as for SARS-CoV in previous publications. Understanding this heterogeneity is important, because modeling studies demonstrate that the models incorporating variability in transmission differ substantially from standard outbreak models, and, in these models, individually-targeted interventions are much more effective than untargeted interventions. &quot;Superspreading&quot; appears to be a normal feature of disease transmission, and one that must be understood if we are to effectively prevent the spread of respiratory infection. The presence of heterogeneity in transmission also makes the interpretation of observational cohort data about risk factors for transmission difficult: our analysis illustrates the substantial potential impact of confounding in such cohorts. Observational cohort data may have very limited value for assessing transmission of influenza unless patient transmission heterogeneity can be taken into account.\nOur findings with respect to HCW activity risk factors are similar to those of other studies assessing HCW risks unadjusted for patient factors, but illustrate the complexity of analyses of cohort studies in these settings. The factors associated with SARS in other analyses are somewhat different, but essentially all are related to procedures that bring workers into proximity with a patient's airway for prolonged periods of time, or with unprotected faces. In keeping with data from Teleman et al. our highest estimated HCW risk in GEE models was eye or mucous membrane exposure to body fluids (OR = 7.3), while in CART analysis, the primary HCW related risk factor was whether or not eye protection was worn. This should not be interpreted as meaning that conjunctival contact in particular is a primary mode of spread of SARS CoV: when exposure to droplet spray occurs, is it generally not possible to distinguish exposure to eyes versus other mucous membranes. Absence of eye protection results in exposure of facial skin, and transmission could subsequently be from facial skin to hand to other mucous membrane. It is also possible that absence of eye protection is a marker for reduced adherence to other precautionary measures for which adherence is not adequately captured by self-report.\nThe range of different types of healthcare providers infected emphasizes that healthcare worker safety is not an issue limited to one profession, or to those workers with less education or control over their workplace situation. The finding in our study and those of others that a relatively small amount of education was associated with significant increases in adherence to precautions and reductions in infection also highlights the fact that, at least in some situations, education alone is enough to provide significant safety benefits. Where possible, hospital planners should consider building plans for &quot;just-in-time&quot; training into pandemic and outbreak responses.\nCART and GEE logistic regression were complementary techniques for identifying HCW and patient characteristics most associated with transmission of SARS-CoV. Advantages of CART include the ability to identify interactions between variables by identifying specific combinations of variables which place HCWs at higher risk of acquiring SARS, modeling of nonlinear relationships between the dependent and independent variables, ability to handle numerical data that is highly skewed and categorical data with either ordinal or non-ordinal structures and its ease of interpretation. While logistic regression models are not as flexible in handling this variety of data, they yield odds ratios and p values, which are useful for quantifying risk and measuring the statistical significance of relationships between variables. The CART analyses were comparable with logistic regression GEE models with respect to sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.\nThere are several limitations to this study. Although we used patient charts to enhance recall, and validated our questionnaire, HCW recall of various exposures may have been imperfect due to the stress of caring for SARS patients and the time from exposure to interview, may have been biased by HCW outcomes, or may themselves have introduced biases if some were more accurate or complete than others. While our assumption that patients who were known to have infected other HCWs also infected the three HCWs whose source of infection was unclear had the potential to overestimate the superspreader phenomenon, secondary analyses confirmed our findings. While we might speculate that presence in the room during an ECG identified as a risk factor because other variables incompletely adjusted for duration of time in the room when a patient is deteriorating rapidly, we do not have a satisfactory explanation for why this variable is associated with SARS-CoV transmission. Finally, since the greatest risk of transmission of SARS-CoV occurred in the cohort of HCWs caring for the patient with the lowest PaO2 to FiO2 (P/F) ratio, the superspreader effect was confounded with the P/F ratio effect, and it is not possible to conclude that low patient P/F ratio is associated with SARS-CoV transmission.\nAlthough some authors have assumed that all viral respiratory infections have the same relative modes of transmission, such that identified risk factors and/or interventions that prevent transmission for one can be assumed to be true for others, it is not clear that knowledge about risk factors for SARS coronavirus infection can be directly applied to other diseases such as influenza. It is clear, however, that, during the SARS outbreak, HCW exposures to body fluids occurred frequently and adherence to recommended precautions was often incomplete, putting HCWs at significant risk of infection. Thus, research into the incidence of and risk factors for influenza transmission in acute care hospital settings, and into interventions effective in minimizing transmission, is urgently needed.\nSupporting Information\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nFunding: This research was funded by a contract from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care.

An integrated database was constructed from several sources containing information on epidemiological, demographic, and clinical variables.\n\n We estimated the key epidemiological distributions: infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death, and admission to discharge.\n\n We measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patients’age and the time from onset to admission.\n\n\nFindings\nAfter the initial phase of exponential growth, the rate of confirmed cases fell to less than 20 per day by April 28. Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts.\n\n The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6.4 days (95% Cl 5.2–7.7).\n\n The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic.\n\n The estimated case fatality rate was 13.2% (9.8–16.8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43.3% (35.2–52.4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric ? distribution.\n\n A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6.8% (4.0–9.6) and 55.0% (45.3–64.7), respectively.\n\n Case clusters have played an important part in the course of the epidemic.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients’age was strongly associated with outcome.\n\n The time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital did not alter outcome, but shorter intervals will be important to the wider population by restricting the infectious period before patients are placed in quarantine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112380","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Christl A","surname":"Donnelly","email":"c.donnelly@imperial.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Azra C","surname":"Ghani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anthony J","surname":"Hedley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Fraser","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Steven","surname":"Riley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laith J","surname":"Abu-Raddad","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lai-Ming","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thuan-Quoc","surname":"Thach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patsy","surname":"Chau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"King-Pan","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tai-Hing","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lai-Yin","surname":"Tse","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Tsang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-Haei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James HB","surname":"Kong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edith MC","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neil M","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roy M","surname":"Anderson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Investigation of a nosocomial outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto, Canada.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Infection control guidance for healthcare workers in healthcare facilities and other institutional settings.

weight prediction from digital images","abstract":"Monitoring, recording, and predicting livestock body weight (BW) allows for timely intervention in diets and health, greater efficiency in genetic selection, and identification of optimal times to market animals because animals that have already reached the point of slaughter represent a burden for the feedlot.\n There are currently two main approaches (direct and indirect) to measure the BW in livestock.\n Direct approaches include partial-weight or full-weight industrial scales placed in designated locations on large farms that measure passively or dynamically the weight of livestock.\n While these devices are very accurate, their acquisition, intended purpose and operation size, repeated calibration and maintenance costs associated with their placement in high-temperature variability, and corrosive environments are significant and beyond the affordability and sustainability limits of small and medium size farms and even of commercial operators.\n As a more affordable alternative to direct weighing approaches, indirect approaches have been developed based on observed or inferred relationships between biometric and morphometric measurements of livestock and their BW.\n Initial indirect approaches involved manual measurements of animals using measuring tapes and tubes and the use of regression equations able to correlate such measurements with BW.\n While such approaches have good BW prediction accuracies, they are time consuming, require trained and skilled farm laborers, and can be stressful for both animals and handlers especially when repeated daily.\n With the concomitant advancement of contactless electro-optical sensors (e.\ng.\n, 2D, 3D, infrared cameras), computer vision (CV) technologies, and artificial intelligence fields such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), 2D and 3D images have started to be used as biometric and morphometric proxies for BW estimations.\n This manuscript provides a review of CV-based and ML/DL-based BW prediction methods and discusses their strengths, weaknesses, and industry applicability potential.\n","id":"PMC7904040","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

issue.\n However such solutions are not desired when the number of samples in the small class is limited.\n Moreover the use of inadequate performance metrics, such as accuracy, lead to poor generalization results because the classifiers tend to predict the largest size class.\n One of the good approaches to deal with this issue is to optimize performance metrics that are designed to handle data imbalance.\n Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is widely used in Bioinformatics as a performance metric.\n We are interested in developing a new classifier based on the MCC metric to handle imbalanced data.\n We derive an optimal Bayes classifier for the MCC metric using an approach based on Frechet derivative.\n We show that the proposed algorithm has the nice theoretical property of consistency.\n Using simulated data, we verify the correctness of our optimality result by searching in the space of all possible binary classifiers.\n The proposed classifier is evaluated on 64 datasets from a wide range data imbalance.\n We compare both classification performance and CPU efficiency for three classifiers: 1) the proposed algorithm (MCC-classifier), the Bayes classifier

learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet.\n\n Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks.\n\n However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced

all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par3'>In this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario.\n\n We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6941312","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Maternal Performance Traits in Commercially Farmed New Zealand Beef Cattle","abstract":"Simple Summary\nEnhancing maternal performance in a beef cattle enterprise can increase overall profitability.\n\n Knowledge of the degree of genetic variation in relevant traits is required to inform breeding decisions in commercial environments.\n\n The objective of this research was to examine the inheritance of maternal performance traits and to evaluate the trait complementarity among reproduction, live weight, hip height, body condition score and maternal weaning weight in 15-month-old heifers, 2-year-old cows and mature cows using data collected on commercial New Zealand hill country farms.\n\n Results from this study indicate that almost no genetic variation exists for pregnancy outcomes in 15-month-old heifers and mature cows under New Zealand farming conditions but there is potential to improve reproductive performance in 2-year-old cows through genetic selection.\n\n Cows with greater genetic potential for rebreeding performance after their first calving season were more likely to have greater live weight, hip height and body condition score as heifers but were unlikely to become larger cows at maturity.\n\n Cows with genetics for greater maternal weaning weight were more likely to carry lower body condition and those animals tended to show greater reproductive performance.\n\n\nAbstract\nMaternal performance is a major driver of profitability in cow-calf beef cattle enterprises.\n\n The aim of this research was to evaluate the inheritance of maternal performance traits and examine the intercorrelation among reproduction, live weight, hip height, body condition and maternal contribution to calf weaning weight in 15-month-old heifers, 2-year-old cows and mature cows in New Zealand beef herds.\n\n Data were collected on a total of 14,241 cows and their progeny on five commercial New Zealand hill country farms.\n\n Heritabilities were low for reproductive traits in heifers and mature cows (0–0.06) but were greater in 2-year-old cows (0.12–0.21).\n\n Body condition scores were lowly (0.15–0.26) and live weights (0.42–0.48) and hip heights (0.47–0.65) highly heritable in heifers, 2-year-old cows and mature cows.\n\n Results indicate that 2-year-old cows with higher genetic potential for rebreeding ability may have greater genetic merit for live weight, hip height and body condition as heifers (rg = 0.19–0.54) but are unlikely to be larger cows at maturity (rg = ?0.27–?0.10).\n\n The maternal genetic effect on weaning weight had a heritability of 0.20 and was negatively genetically correlated with body condition score in lactating cows (rg = ?0.55–?0.40) but positively genetically correlated with rebreeding performance (rg = 0.48).\n\n\n","id":"PMC8467944","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Franziska","surname":"Weik","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rebecca

techniques to investigate disease risk classification as a proxy for compromised biosecurity of cattle herds in Wales","abstract":"Background\nBiosecurity is at the forefront of the fight against infectious diseases in animal populations.\n\n Few research studies have attempted to identify and quantify the effectiveness of biosecurity against disease introduction or presence in cattle farms and, when done, they have relied on the collection of on-farm data.\n\n Data on environmental, animal movement, demographic/husbandry systems and density disease determinants can be collated without requiring additional specific on-farm data collection activities, since they have already been collected for some other purposes.\n\n The aim of this study was to classify cattle herds according to their risk of disease presence as a proxy for compromised biosecurity in the cattle population of Wales in 2004 for risk-based surveillance purposes.\n\n\nResults\nThree data mining methods have been applied: logistic regression, classification trees and factor analysis.\n\n Using the cattle holding population in Wales, a holding was considered positive if at least bovine TB or one of the ten most frequently diagnosed infectious or transmissible non-notifiable diseases in England and Wales, according to the Veterinary Investigation Surveillance Report (VIDA) had been diagnosed in 2004. High-risk holdings can be described as open large cattle herds located in high-density cattle areas with frequent movements off to many locations within Wales.\n\n Additional risks are associated with the holding being a dairy enterprise and with a large farming area.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis work has demonstrated the potential of mining various livestock-relevant databases to obtain generic criteria for individual cattle herd biosecurity risk classification.\n\n Despite the data and analytical constraints the described risk profiles are highly specific and present variable sensitivity depending on the model specifications.\n\n Risk profiling of farms provides a tool for designing targeted surveillance activities for endemic or emerging diseases, regardless of the prior amount of information available on biosecurity at farm level.\n\n As the delivery of practical evidence-based information and advice is one of the priorities of Defra's new Animal Health and Welfare Strategy (AHWS), data-driven models, derived from existing databases, need to be developed that can then be used to inform activities during outbreaks of endemic diseases and to help design surveillance activities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2488331","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Ángel","surname":"Ortiz-Pelaez","email":"apelaez@rvc.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dirk U","surname":"Pfeiffer","email":"pfeiffer@rvc.ac.uk","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3168/jds.2013-6693","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prediction of Insemination Outcomes in Holstein Dairy Cattle Using Alternative Machine Learning Algorithms","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A Comparison of Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression for the Prediction of Coliform Mastitis in Dairy Cows","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.4141/A98-100","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Investigation into the Production and Conformation Traits Associated with Clinical Mastitis Using Artificial Neural Networks","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2527/1993.7161372x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Efficacy of Predicting Dystocia in Yearling Beef Heifers: II.

The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in week 2 is unrelated to uncontrolled viral replication but may be related to immunopathological damage.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112410","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"JSM","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"CM","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"VCC","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KS","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"IFN","surname":"Hung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"LLM","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KI","surname":"Law","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"BSF","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"TYW","surname":"Hon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"CS","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KH","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"JSC","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"BJ","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"WL","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"RWM","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KY","surname":"Yuen","email":"kyyuen@hkucc.hku.hk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa030685","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome cases among protected health-care workers:Toronto, Canada, April 2003.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Saturday night fever: a common-source outbreak of rubella among adults in Hawaii.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"An explosive point-source measles outbreak in a highly vaccinated poulation.

heterogeneous.\n Traditional “compartmental” modeling in epidemiology, however, assumes that population groups are fully mixed, that is, every individual has an equal chance of spreading the disease to every other.\n Applications of compartmental models to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) resulted in estimates of the fundamental quantity called the basic reproductive number R0—the number of new cases of SARS resulting from a single initial case—above one, implying that, without public health intervention, most outbreaks should spark large-scale epidemics.\n Here we compare these predictions to the early epidemiology of SARS.\n We apply the methods of contact network epidemiology to illustrate that for a single value of R0, any two outbreaks, even in the same setting, may have very different epidemiological outcomes.\n We offer quantitative insight into the heterogeneity of SARS outbreaks worldwide, and illustrate the utility of this approach for assessing public health

Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada in 2003. The effective reproduction numbers revealed that epidemics in the various affected regions were characterized by markedly similar disease transmission potentials and similar levels of effectiveness of control measures.\n In controlling SARS outbreaks, timely alerts have been essential: Delaying the institution of control measures by 1 week would have nearly tripled the epidemic size and would have increased the expected epidemic duration by 4 weeks.\n","id":"PMC7110200","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Jacco","surname":"Wallinga","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Teunis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1002.030707","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Lack of SARS Transmission among Public Hospital Workers, Vietnam","abstract":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Vietnam was amplified by nosocomial spread within hospital A, but no transmission was reported in hospital B, the second of two designated SARS hospitals.\n Our study documents lack of SARS-associated coronavirus transmission to hospital B workers, despite variable infection control measures and the use of personal protective equipment.\n","id":"PMC3322918","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","authors":[{"firstname":"Le Dang","surname":"Ha","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sharon A.","surname":"Bloom","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nguyen Quang","surname":"Hien","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susan A.","surname":"Maloney","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Le Quynh","surname":"Mai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katrin C.","surname":"Leitmeyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bach Huy","surname":"Anh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mary G.","surname":"Reynolds","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joel M.","surname":"Montgomery","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James A.","surname":"Comer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"PeterW.","surname":"Horby","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aileen J.","surname":"Plant","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Lack of SARS transmission among healthcare workers, United States","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.1096898","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Public health risk from the avian H5N1 influenza epidemic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.2.279","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Branching process models for surveillance of infectious diseases controlled by mass vaccination","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Toronto SARS Hospital Investigation Team.
