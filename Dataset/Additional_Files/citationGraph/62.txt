Symptoms are more frequently encountered during the winter &quot;flu season.&quot; More than 200 different viruses can cause common colds in adults, including rhinovirus (the most frequent cause), coronavirus, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses. In the United States, on average, adults develop 2 to 4 colds and children 6 to 8 colds each year.  \nHerbal preparations of the leaves and root of the plant Echinacea purpurea increase phagocytic cells in the spleen and bone marrow, acting as phytoimmune modulators or immune system enhancers. In vitro studies support claims of immune modulation and indicate that this effect may be mediated by a modification of the activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages. Echinacea-containing preparations are extensively used for the treatment and prevention of infections and, apart from allergic reactions and an increased incidence of rash, are reported to be generally safe.  \nClinical trials testing the ability of echinacea to prevent colds and ameliorate symptoms have had mixed results. A Cochrane Review found that most available studies reported benefits from echinacea use, but variations in the preparations of echinacea used and methodological quality limited the conclusions. A recent meta-analysis found that standardized echinacea extracts were effective in the prevention of symptoms of the common cold after clinical inoculation. Methodological shortcomings in studies of herbal medicines, including echinacea, have been noted by other researchers as well. A meta-analysis of studies published since 1997 suggested that echinacea was more effective at treating colds than at preventing them.\nAlthough the efficacy of echinacea has not been conclusively demonstrated, there were more than 2.5 million prescriptions for echinacea preparations in Germany in 1993. Use of nonprescription herbal remedies is undoubtedly higher, as almost 40% of patients in a US health maintenance organization indicated using herbal remedies, and echinacea ranks fifth in herbal medicine sales. To address the methodological shortcomings identified in previous echinacea studies, we used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to answer the following question: Does a commonly used echinacea preparation prevent or reduce upper respiratory tract infection symptoms?\nMETHODS\nSampling\nThis study was approved by the University of California San Francisco Institutional Review Board. This research was completed as part of the requirements for completion of the Family Medicine Residency Program at the University of California San Francisco-Fresno. For this reason, a convenience sample of healthy adults working in the University Medical Center Family Health Center, including residents, staff, faculty, and nursing staff, served as the participants in this study. This population was expected to have more equitable exposure to cold/influenza. Recruitment consisted of flyers distributed at the University Medical Center and the Family Health Center. Participation was voluntary, and participants were not reimbursed.\nNinety volunteers aged 18 to 65 years were recruited from hospital personnel in November and December 1998. The project was described, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Persons with known immune dysfunction, those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, pregnant or lactating women, and persons with allergies to echinacea or parsley were excluded. Individual characteristics, such as age, race/ethnicity, tobacco use, presence of allergic rhinitis, use of other upper respiratory tract infection preventive measures (herbs, vitamins, or medications), and administration of the influenza vaccine, were recorded. Individuals currently using echinacea were not considered for the study, whereas those using other upper respiratory tract infection preventive measures were allowed to continue their use. Each participant was given an 8-week supply of medicine on enrollment.\nProcedure\nParticipants were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control group from a list generated using the random-number generator in a spreadsheet program (Microsoft Excel; Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Washington). Participants were asked to take 3 capsules 2 times daily for 8 weeks of either E purpurea, 300 mg per capsule, or parsley, 300 mg per capsule. This dose of echinacea was similar to that recommended by the manufacturer. Both types of capsules were provided by the same company and were indistinguishable in size, color, and smell. Capsules were provided in containers marked &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B.&quot; Participants, the main investigator, and all persons involved in the study remained blinded to the identity of each group until data analyses were completed.\nParticipants were contacted by telephone once a week by a trained research assistant and asked to report the number of days during that week in which they experienced sore throat, runny nose, headache, hoarseness, nasal congestion, muscle aches, cough, and fever. Participants with symptoms were also asked about the number of days missed from work and any medications used to treat symptoms, (eg, aspirin, acetaminophen, vitamins, and cold formulas). The number of capsules missed that week and the perceived adverse effects were also recorded. Participants were defined as nonadherent and were excluded from data analysis if they missed more than one-third of the recommended dosage for 2 or more weeks. None of the persons in this study experienced serious adverse effects requiring disclosure of group assignment. Participants were told at the completion of data analyses whether they were in the experimental or placebo group.\nStatistical Analysis\nData were entered into a database program (Microsoft Access; Microsoft Corp) and were analyzed using statistical analysis software (SAS for Windows, release 6.12; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). A prospective power analysis was calculated. Based on the assumption of an effect size of 14%, a sample size of 80 was calculated to provide sufficient power (0.80) to detect a difference of 30% (cold frequency SD = 0.5) to 60% (cold frequency SD = 1.0) between the 2 groups at alpha = .05.\nMissing data from dropped participants precluded an intention-to-treat analysis. A per-protocol analysis was performed. Means and proportions were calculated for individual characteristics. chi2 and t tests were used to test for differences between the groups after randomization. The median number of days with each individual symptom was reported owing to the nonnormal distribution of this information. The total number of days with symptoms was calculated by summing the maximum number of days reported with the most prevalent symptom in each week. Thus, the maximum possible total number of symptom days was 56. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the treatment and placebo groups for each of the 8 symptoms and the total symptom days. We also compared the 2 groups each week separately for persons reporting symptoms of any kind vs no symptoms at all. chi2 or Fisher exact tests were used to compare these data.\nRESULTS\nRandomization and participation results.\nDemographic Characteristics of the 90 Study Participants\n	 	\nNinety individuals were recruited for this study and randomly assigned to either the placebo or the echinacea group. Fifteen individuals in the echinacea group and 13 in the placebo group chose to leave the study, a 31% dropout rate (Fig 1) . Six individuals leaving the study (3 from each group) reported adverse effects that contributed to their study discontinuation. Each group also had 2 nonadherent individuals. There were no significant differences in individual characteristics, reason for dropout, or adherence between the 2 groups after randomization (data not shown). Fifty-eight individuals were included in the final analyses, 28 in the echinacea group and 30 in the placebo group. Table 1 has the individual characteristics for these groups and for individuals randomized but not analyzed. There were no significant differences between the echinacea and placebo groups in their demographic characteristics. There were significant differences between individuals who dropped out or were nonadherent and those who completed the study. Persons not included in the final analysis used fewer vitamins and herbs (P &lt; .01) and reported fewer allergies (P = .03).\nIncidence of Upper Respiratory Tract Symptoms in 8 Weeks by Treatment Group\n	 	\n Table 2 summarizes the symptom information for the 2 groups during the 8-week period. Each of the 8 symptoms was compared separately for the 2 groups. No significant differences were found. The median total number of sick days was 9.0 for the echinacea group and 14.0 for the placebo group (z = -0.42; P = .67). Mild adverse effects were noted by 8% of the echinacea group and 7% of the placebo group (P = .24) (data not shown).\nParticipants with any respiratory problems.\nWe compared the 2 groups each week for those reporting symptoms of any kind. Approximately 40% of the participants reported having symptoms most weeks, with no differences between the 2 groups (Fig 2) . Of individuals in either group who reported symptoms, less than half treated those symptoms, and even fewer missed work because of them. The placebo group consistently reported symptoms during any given week more than the echinacea group and treated themselves more often. However, none of these differences were statistically significant.\nDISCUSSION\nWe found no difference in total symptom days or individual respiratory symptoms for patients taking prophylactic echinacea for 8 weeks compared with those taking parsley capsules. These findings are consistent with other recent studies that do not demonstrate the effectiveness of echinacea in preventing upper respiratory tract infections.\nIt is conceivable that echinacea actually reduces the total number of symptom days and that this study was simply too small to detect the underlying difference. Assuming the same variance as we observed, at a significance level of 5% and 80% power, group sizes of 28 and 30 participants provided numbers sufficient to detect only a prophylactic echinacea effect of 10 total symptom days. If we had retained and analyzed all the enrolled individuals, this detectable difference would have been reduced to 8 total symptom days. We saw an actual difference of 5 days in the median total number of symptom days. The total number of symptom days ranged from 0 to 49 (of 56) in the echinacea group and from 0 to 41 in the placebo group. Assuming an actual reduction of 5 total symptom days with echinacea use, a per-group sample size of 111 would be required to detect this reduction at the same 80% power and 5% significance.\nThe relatively large number of unanalyzed individuals who dropped out or took less than one-third of the scheduled doses (32 of 90) may have biased the results. Excluded individuals were also different from study participants because they reported less herbal remedy use and fewer allergy symptoms. These differences suggest that the dropouts are people who are less afflicted with respiratory symptoms and less preoccupied with prevention. One might speculate that the burden of adherence to the protocol was excessive for this group. Dropouts and nonadherent participants were evenly distributed between the control and intervention groups.\nAnother limitation of this study is the use of health care professionals as participants, which makes it difficult to generalize these findings to other groups. We did not record participant sex or characterize the findings by this variable. Neither did we control for preventive measures that may have been taken by study participants and possibly biased the findings. Outcomes were not collected from those who dropped out, precluding an intention-to-treat analysis. However, the equal number of dropouts in both arms, coupled with the finding of no effect on symptom days in those taking echinacea, suggests that an intention-to-treat analysis would likely not have changed the conclusions.\nBecause this study used a dried plant extract, it can be argued that another echinacea formulation might have been more efficacious, but systematic reviews have failed to identify therapeutic distinctions between echinacea preparations. This study involved the use of readily available over-the-counter products widely used by the public. Although none are suspected, if parsley has effects on respiratory symptoms, we could expect that findings might be different for the use of a truly inert placebo. A MEDLINE search of parsley and respiratory tract infections yielded no results.\nAllopathic medicine has much to learn about alternative therapies. However, until further research is conducted that has greater power to detect differences in outcomes, that accounts for dropout rates, and that standardizes dose effects, the findings from this randomized controlled trial suggest that echinacea does not have a meaningful effect on respiratory tract infection symptoms.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Sean Schafer, MD, research director of the University of California San Francisco Fresno Family Medicine Residency while this research was conducted, for his valuable contributions in the revision process of the manuscript.\nREFERENCES\nZinc gluconate lozenges for treating the common cold: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study\nRhinovirus infections in an industrial population, I: the occurrence of illness\nThe American coneflower: a prophylactic role involving nonspecific immunity\nEfficacy and mode of action of an immunomodulator herbal preparation containing Echinacea, wild indigo, and white cedar\nUse of echinacea in medicine\nMacrophage activation by the polysaccharide arabinogalactan isolated from plant cell cultures of Echinacea purpurea\nApplication of purified polysaccharides from cell cultures of the plant Echinacea purpurea to test subjects mediates activation of the phagocyte system\nResults of five randomized studies on the immunomodulatory activity of preparations of Echinacea\nA proprietary extract from the echinacea plant (Echinacea purpurea) enhances systemic immune response during a common cold\nEvaluation of echinacea for treatment of the common cold\nToxicity of Echinacea purpurea: acute, subacute and genotoxicity studies\nCan herbal products be used safely during pregnancy? focus on echinacea\nThe risk-benefit profile of commonly used herbal therapies: ginkgo, St. John's wort, ginseng, echinacea, saw palmetto, and kava\nEfficacy and safety of echinacea in treating upper respiratory tract infections in children: a randomized controlled trial\nThe efficacy of echinacea compound herbal tea preparation on the severity and duration of upper respiratory and flu symptoms: a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study\nEfficacy and safety of a fixed combination phytomedicine in the treatment of the common cold (acute viral respiratory tract infection): results of a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre study\nIneffectiveness of echinacea for prevention of experimental rhinovirus colds\nEfficacy of Echinacea purpurea in patients with a common cold: a placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind clinical trial\nA randomized controlled trial of the effect of fluid extract of Echinacea purpurea on the incidence and severity of colds and respiratory infections\nEchinacea for prevention and treatment of upper respiratory infections\nEchinacea purpurea for prevention of upper respiratory tract infections in children\nTreatment of the common cold with unrefined Echinacea: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial\nEfficacy of a standardized echinacea preparation (Echinilin) for the treatment of the common cold: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial\nEchinacea purpurea therapy for the treatment of the common cold: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial\nEchinacea purpurea for prevention of experimental rhinovirus colds\nEchinacea for preventing and treating the common cold\nEchinacea in the prevention of induced rhinovirus colds: a meta-analysis\nThe methodological quality of randomized controlled trials of homeopathy, herbal medicines and acupuncture\nUse of herbal remedies by patients in a health maintenance organization\nInclusion of patients in clinical trial analysis: the intention-to-treat principle\nDisclosures: Authors have nothing to disclose.\nFunding Sources: This study was supported by grant 5 D39 HP 00023-09 from the .

Introduction\nThe common cold is recognized as the most frequent disease in Western civilization and the number one cause of primary health care consultations. The costs of illness associated with noninfluenza infections are estimated at 40 billion USD, including direct and indirect costs. With the additional costs of illness caused by influenza, upper respiratory tract infections present a serious burden to humanity and to the economy. \nColds comprise a syndrome of symptoms, typically with nasal complaints, cough, sore throat, and sometimes constitutional complaints, like headache, malaise, and fever. The symptoms are typically self-limiting, and they represent a reaction to infection by Rhino-, Corona-, Adeno-, Respiratory Syncytial and (Para-) influenza virus. \nThe development of effective cold preventives is hampered by the multiplicity of viruses and the complex interplay between host and virus. For decades, intense research has focused on applications of broad-spectrum antivirals like interferons (alpha, beta, or gamma), capsid binding proteins, or soluble receptors directed against rhinoviral infection and/or replication. Some therapies showed efficacy in clinically induced infections but failed to significantly prevent colds in larger field studies that included multiple types of respiratory viruses. Nasal applications of interferons showed good preventative efficacy but were typically accompanied by adverse reactions like nasal bleeding. \nVaccination presents an effective method for managing seasonal influenza and respiratory, syncytial virus (RSV) in children. However, the efficacy of vaccination depends on the immunological fitness of the recipient and primarily in older individuals or those with chronic heart disease only insufficient immunity can be built up, resulting in a reduced immunity in this vulnerable population. \nAnother method for preventing cold infections is to modulate the immune system. In this context, Echinacea plays an important therapeutic role. For several decades, Echinacea has been used to prevent colds and the flu. Despite its worldwide acceptance, only limited data are available on its prophylactic efficacy. Long-term clinical trials that studied spontaneous colds, conducted by Schoeneberger, Schmidt and Schenk, Cohen et al., and Melchart et al., reported mixed results. Three studies on artificially induced rhinovirus infections showed a trend toward preventing symptomatic cold episodes by Echinacea. Generally, the prophylactic benefits reached significance when data were pooled in a meta-analysis, because single studies tended to have small sample sizes and undefined or low statistical power. \nOn the other hand, a good safety profile is mandatory for therapies that are designed to be taken over several months. Considering the mild-to-moderate nature of the common cold, a potential preventive therapy by itself must induce only a minimal safety risk to produce a positive risk benefit ratio. In the predominant absence of side effects a sufficiently important difference of 20-32% is expected from cold treatments like vitamins and herbal extracts.\nThe present study aimed to examine safety parameters of E. purpurea during long-term treatment. The study was designed to also investigate the efficacy profile with predefined, primary variables of efficacy and with an appropriate sample size based on power calculations. Overall, this study represented the largest clinical trial ever performed to test the safety and efficacy of Echinacea extract, and it was the first study to employ virus screening techniques.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Design\nThis study was a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at the Common Cold Center in Cardiff University (United Kingdom). The study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki (2000), the international conference on harmonization, good clinical practice regulations, the association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, and the human tissue authority. The trial received ethical approval from the local ethics committee by 28th July 2009 and, finally, from the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (MHRA) on the 2nd July 2009. The study was registered under the Eudra-CT number, 2009-012297-12. From October to November 2009, healthy participants were included in the study and were randomly allocated to receive either E. purpurea extract or placebo. At the inclusion visit, every participant received medication to cover 1 month of treatment and a diary for daily recordings of adverse reactions (&quot;did you have any unusual or unexpected symptoms today?&quot;), the presence and severity of cold-related symptoms and the use of any concurrent medication. Participants returned each month to the study center, and they returned any unused medication and the completed diaries. After checking compliance and the completion of the returned diary, a new treatment and diary were issued for another month. After the acceptance of an amendment to the study protocol, we also handed out three kits for self-collection of nasal secretions during acute cold episodes. Each kit contained a mid-turbinate nasal swab, suitable for self-collection, a vial that contained universal transport medium for storage at room temperature (COPAN, Brescia, Italy), and a bag for safe transport of the samples (DaklaPack, Oberhausen, Germany).\n2.2. Treatment\nThe Echinacea product was the commercially available Echinaforce drops produced by A. Vogel Bioforce AG, Switzerland. Echinaforce was prepared by alcoholic (57.3% m/m) extraction from freshly harvested E. purpurea with a combination of 95% herba (DER = 1 : 12) and 5% roots (DER = 1 : 11). The sample was microbiologically tested and proven to be free of endotoxins. The batch used in this study (027643) was standardized to contain 5 mg/100 g of dodecatetraenoic acid isobutylamide, based on high-performance liquid chromatography measurements. Placebo drops were similar in shape, color, consistency, odor, flavor, and they contained the same amount of alcohol. The liquids were aliquoted into amber bottles and closed with a screw cap attached to an integrated, calibrated syringe for accurate dosing (0.9 mL/dose). Primary and secondary packaging was identical for the verum and placebo. \n2.3. Dosing\nThe therapy regimen was in accordance with the recommendation by the manufacturer. Participants swallowed 3 x 0.9 mL per day for illness prevention. This corresponded to 2400 mg of extract per day. During acute stages of colds, the participants were instructed to increase the dose to 5 x 0.9 mL per day; this totaled a daily dose of 4000 mg of extract. Each single dose was diluted in water and retained in the mouth for 10 s. This application method was expected to provide maximum local antiviral effects. Compliance was assessed at the monthly visits by weighing the returned bottles. Adherence to the recommended dosing was calculated based on the total prophylactic and acute dosing recorded in the diary. Overall, the method of administration reflected the traditional use of E. purpurea, and it provided accurate Echinaforce dosing.\n2.4. Study Participants and Randomization\nParticipants were recruited via advertisements around the university campus. At first contact, respondents received an info-leaflet describing the trial. The study inclusion criteria were adults (&gt;=18 years old) of good physical condition, that experienced &gt;=2 colds per year. The exclusion criteria were ineffective contraception; participation in another study; women that were pregnant or breast feeding; current cold infection; currently taking antimicrobial or antiviral medication; alcohol or drug abuse; psychiatric disorders; epilepsy; attempted suicide; planned surgical intervention; serious chronic disease that could influence absorption, metabolism, or elimination of the medication; known AIDS or other autoimmune diseases; diabetes type 1; corticosteroid-treated asthma; medicinally treated atopy or allergy; a known allergy to plants of the composite family (Asteraceae). Volunteers with clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities were dropped out after inclusion. All participants provided signed, informed consent.\nA total of 755 subjects were included. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive treatment or placebo. The randomization code was prepared in block-sizes of 6 with the &quot;RANCODE Professional 3.6&quot; program. Each participant received treatment based on his/her identification number, which was allocated according to the time point of inclusion. Drugs were personally dispensed by the investigator or personnel authorized by the investigator. The randomization procedure was prepared by a statistician. The original randomization code was retained by the statistician in a sealed envelope, and one copy was conveyed to the investigator. Only in a case of emergency the investigator was permitted to open the envelope that contained the identification of a treatment.\nThe blinding of the study treatment was found to be adequate, when pretested in 79 test persons. In both treatment groups, nearly half of the participants believed that they were given the Echinaforce preparation (17 of 38 subjects (45%) with placebo and 19 of 41 subjects (46%) with verum). A total of 15 recipients of placebo (39%) and 17 (42%) with verum stated that they did not know which preparation they were given.\n2.5. Sample Size Calculation\nWith at least 300 evaluable subjects in each group, assuming a 0.2 proportion of individuals with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) within each group, the upper limit of the observed one-sided 97.5% confidence interval of the difference between the placebo proportion, piP, and the Echinaforce proportion, piE, was expected to be less than 0.1 with 86% power. Assuming a 20% drop-out rate, where 20% of participants would not follow the study per protocol for the entire 4 months of treatment, we estimated that 750 subjects would be required for inclusion into the study. With 700 cumulated episode days in the Echinaforce group, an anticipated prophylactic effect of 25%, resulting in 875 episode days for the placebo group, the study had sufficient statistical power to show prophylactic benefits with P &lt; 0.05.\n2.6. Clinical Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis\nOver the entire study period, all participants retained a diary to record AEs by answering the question &quot;Did you have any unusual or unexpected symptoms today?&quot; Moreover, at the monthly study visits, participants were interviewed about acute or experienced events by the study physician. The AE analysis included all AEs with a date/time of onset on or after the start date of the study treatment. The analysis excluded AEs with a date/time of onset that occurred before the start date or when information on the date/time of onset was missing. All AEs were coded with the lowest level terms from the latest installed version of the MedDRA Dictionary (V. 13.1). \nFor AEs described by a physician(s), the lowest level term was chosen that best matched the physician's actual description. These lowest level terms were translated into preferred terms (PTs) and classified into a system organ class (SOC) employing the latest installed version of the MedDRA Dictionary (V. 13.1). Primary analysis was performed on the basis of the per protocol population.\nAt inclusion and exclusion visits, participants provided blood samples. These were processed to determine clinical chemistry, hematology parameters, and differential blood cell counts. Clinically relevant abnormalities that deviated from the normal range were flagged by the laboratory. The final safety criterion was the assessment, by participants and physicians, of therapy tolerability.\nCausal relationship between recorded AEs and the study medication was rated by the physician as either &quot;not related,&quot; &quot;unlikely,&quot; &quot;possible,&quot; &quot;probable/likely,&quot; &quot;certain,&quot; &quot;not assessable/unclassifiable,&quot; &quot;unknown,&quot; or &quot;not applicable.&quot; AEs that were at least &quot;possibly&quot; related to the medication were considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs); these were included in the primary analysis of the per protocol collective (PP). With this respect, the proportion of patients with any ADRs was compared between groups to determine the non-inferiority of the treatment. To prove safety, there should be less than a 10% (non-inferiority limit) difference between the proportions of patients with ADRs in the Echinaforce and placebo groups. The alternative hypothesis (HA) of interest was to show non-inferiority by determining that the proportion of patients with ADRs in the Echinaforce group (piE) would be lower than the proportion of patients with ADRs in the placebo group (piP) plus delta (i.e., HA: piE &lt; piP + delta). The alternative hypothesis was accepted when the upper 95% confidence limit (two-sided) of the difference in proportions between Echinaforce and placebo was lower than delta. For this study, delta (delta) was 0.1, corresponding to 10%. The occurrence of AEs was a secondary safety variable and was deduced from the safety collective.\nThe second question the participant answered in the diary, &quot;Do you believe you have a cold today?&quot; was answered yes or no. During acute colds, the symptoms &quot;headache,&quot; &quot;chilliness,&quot; &quot;sneezing,&quot; &quot;nasal obstruction,&quot; &quot;nasal discharge,&quot; &quot;sore throat,&quot; &quot;cough,&quot; and &quot;malaise&quot; were rated on a 4-point Likert scale with 0 or no entry = absence, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe symptoms. In addition, the participant indicated in the diary the daily intake of concomitant medication and/or therapy. This matrix was based on the work by Jackson and colleagues, who described the clinical features and symptoms of a virally induced common cold. Their definition is currently accepted as the most valid method for differentiating a cold from isolated symptoms (like hay fever or allergies) that do not develop into the clinical picture of a cold. Thus, a cold episode was defined as a minimal total symptom score of 14 (summed over 6 consecutive days), and the participants believed they had a cold and/or reported rhinorrhea that lasted for &gt;=3 days. A set of three predefined prophylactic variables were analyzed in a confirmatory manner: (1) the total number of cold episodes, (2) cumulative episode days, and (3) comedicated cold episodes. The three parameters were analyzed individually with a chi-square test to determine whether the ratio of cumulated events (i.e., cold episodes) in the treatment groups corresponded to the ratio of the underlying group samples. The primary efficacy analysis focused on episodes with durations &lt;9 days that occurred in the intention to treat (ITT) population. The null-hypothesis was rejected when the chi-square statistic was &gt;3.84, resulting in a P value &lt;0.05. Likewise, the incidence of recurrent infections in the whole group was compared to the underlying group samples with a chi-square statistic analysis. The primary analysis of the preventive efficacy was in agreement with earlier work by Schmidt and Schenk or Tiralongo.\nNasal secretions were collected during acute stages of colds. Samples were inserted into a transport vial and stored at the study site at -70 C. At the end of the clinical trial, the samples were analyzed for the presence of respiratory viruses (Provincial Health Services Authorities, PHSA; BC Center for Disease Control, Vancouver Canada). Briefly, RNA was isolated from the nasal secretions using MagMax Express 96 Nucleic Acid Extractor (Applied BioSystems, Foster City CA) and screened with a Respiratory Virus Panel. The FAST Multiplex panel (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) could detect the following viruses (Virus Type/Subtype): Influenza A H1/H3, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Coronavirus 229E/OC43/NL63/HKU1, Parainfluenza virus 1-4, human Metapneumovirus, Entero-rhinovirus, Adenovirus, and human Bocavirus. Frequency ratios of every virus and of membranous virus infections between treatment groups were compared to the underlying group sizes using a chi-square test. \nAll statistical analyses were performed with the SAS system (Version 9.2) and Testimate 6.4 (IDV, Datenanalyse und Versuchsplanung, Gauting/Munchen). \n3. Results\nA total of 755 study subjects were screened and allocated into one of the treatment groups between October and November 2009. Of these, 673 subjects completed the study; the last patient visit was conducted in late April 2010. Eighty-two (10.9%) subjects discontinued the trial prematurely; of these, 38 were out of contact after randomization, 16 withdrew consent, 3 terminated the study due to technical reasons, 3 terminated due to intolerable AEs or deterioration of the participant's health, and 22 withdrew for no documented reason. A complete flow diagram of participant disposition is shown in Figure 1.\n3.1. Demographic Data and Other Baseline Characteristics\nThe two groups were comparable with regard of age, gender, body weight, height, and body mass index (BMI). There was no noticeable difference between groups in anamnestic variables, including blood pressure or heart rate. The only variable that was significantly different between groups was the susceptibility to colds, measured as the number of colds experienced in the past. Participants in the placebo group were significantly less susceptible to infections than those in the Echinacea group (P &lt; 0.05, Fisher's exact test) (see Table 1).\n3.2. Analysis of Safety Variables\nA total of 25 subjects in the Echinaforce group (9.0%) and 30 subjects in the placebo group (10.0%) experienced 27 and 30 ADRs, respectively. The percentage difference was -0.97%, with an upper limit of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval of 3.6%, which is less than 10%. Consequently, Echinaforce was demonstrated to be noninferior to placebo in the incidence of ADRs as per protocol population.\nA total of 293 AEs were reported by 177 subjects treated with Echinaforce and 306 AEs were reported by 172 subjects in the placebo group (safety collective). Four AEs in the Echinaforce group and 3 in the placebo group led to discontinuation of treatment (Table 2). No severe AE was observed with Echinaforce. One severe AE (glandular fever) occurred with placebo, and this required hospitalization.\nOverall, no significant difference could be identified in the occurrence of AEs between groups, whether related or unrelated to the study drug (Fisher's exact test). This did not change when considering the total numbers, the system organ class, or the preferred terms (data not shown). \nIn the hematological or biochemical measures no significant or clinically relevant changes from before to after Echinaforce treatment and in comparison to placebo were detected. No abnormalities were found after the 4-month exposure to Echinaforce. Previously reported safety concerns like induction of allergic reactions, leucopenia, or autoimmune diseases were not observed under Echinacea treatment.\nAbout 64% of participants in the Echinaforce group and 71% in the placebo group assessed the tolerability of the medicine to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;very good.&quot; There was no significant difference between groups.\n3.3. Analysis of Prophylactic Efficacy\nEfficacy was assessed concurrent with the safety variables during the long-term treatment with Echinaforce. A priori case definitions were made for sample size (calculation), statistical methodology, and measurements of probability or clinical end point.\nThe placebo group had a total of 188 cold episodes, with a collective duration of 850 episode days; in comparison, the Echinaforce group had 149 episodes with a collective duration of 672 episode days (ITT population). The difference of cumulated events (episodes and episode days) between the treatment groups each of 26% reached statistical significance for episode days (P &lt; 0.05, chi-square test). A total of 65 recurring infections were observed in 28 participants with Echinacea and 100 episodes in 43 subjects under placebo treatment. The difference of 59% reached statistical significance as well (P &lt; 0.05, chi-square test).\nConcurrent medication was a significant factor in the present study. In the Echinacea and placebo groups, 58 and 88 episodes, respectively, were treated with aspirin, paracetamol, or ibuprofen. Thus, significantly more (+52%) cold episodes in the placebo group were additionally treated with pain medication (P &lt; 0.05, chi-square test). The median of painkiller medicated cold episodes was 0 in the Echinaforce group and 1 in the placebo group.\nA total of 201 nasal secretion samples were collected in the study; 86 in the Echinacea group and 115 in the placebo group, a difference with borderline significance (P = 0.0663, chi-square test). In 128 samples, the presence of a respiratory virus was confirmed. Throughout the whole study period, 54 viral infections were detected in the Echinaforce treated group and 74 were detected in the placebo group. Intriguingly, the strongest effect was seen with membranous viruses, like Corona-, Influenza-, Parainfluenza-, Respiratory Syncytial- and Metapneumovirus with 24 and 47 detected infections in the two groups (P &lt; 0.05, chi-square test). In total, 14 recurring viral infections occurred under Echinacea, i.c. to 34 under placebo. \nIn long-term studies (here, 4 months), compliance represents a sensible factor. Therefore, we specifically examined a population that took &gt;=100% of the recommended study medication for the entire study period. Eighty-eight compliant subjects in the Echinacea group reported 36 infections and 155 episode days; in comparison, in the placebo group, 58 episodes were reported with 268 episode days. This represented a 53% difference in the number of episode days. Despite the low denominators, this difference was highly statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001, chi-square test). Similar effects were observed in a group that was compliant in documentation (i.e., they reported at least one AE and/or one cold symptom in the diary during 4 months). However, these analyses were of explorative nature and served to substantiate the preventive effects of Echinacea in a compliant group. Moreover, the compliant group was less affected by confounders. \n4. Discussion\nPrevention of mild-to-moderate diseases, like the common cold, requires therapies with satisfactory safety and efficacy profiles. The common cold is particularly in need of preventive treatments, due to its high frequency and high associated costs of illness. It is assumed that the typical adult spends up to 2 years over a lifetime with cold symptoms. Despite its prevalence and substantial research effort in the past, no specific preventive treatment has been developed to date that has a tolerable safety profile for use over the long term. \nIn the present study, safety and efficacy variables were analyzed over a collective total of 11,472 weeks or 2,868 months of prophylaxis from 717 subjects. We used a highly sensitive method to detect AEs, and we included the physician's experience to assess causality (ADRs). In addition, extensive laboratory tests were conducted to examine hematologic and metabolic parameters. \nThe overall safety profile of Echinaforce was very good, based on the total AEs, the ADRs, and the laboratory measurements, within the treatment group and in comparison with placebo. In addition, the global tolerability assessments by the physicians and participants were quite positive. The fact that more than 75% mentioned that they would take the medicine again indicated that a 4-month treatment with Echinaforce was well accepted. Although the present data did not indicate any safety concern with Echinacea in a large population and over an extended period of time, we cannot fully exclude the possibility of rare and very rare adverse events with our data.\nThe study also assessed cold episodes using a highly accepted method developed by Jackson et al.. The study was designed and large enough to show preventive efficacy with sufficient power. We employed a predefined and validated case definition, sample size calculations, statistical methodology, and measurements of probability according to a confirmatory approach. Statistically significant differences between Echinacea and placebo were found for cumulative cold episode days and for comedicated episodes. Overall, we had expected about 1000 cold episodes, but we observed only 337 cold episodes. Although the treatment effect on the number of cold episodes was the same as for cumulated episode days, the statistical power was insufficient to detect a significant difference between groups for this parameter. \nA difference of 26% between groups in an open-field, long-term prevention study was comparable with a previous study on the effects of nasally administered interferons, and this difference can be considered clinically relevant. In the present study, two covariates confounded the reported outcome significantly. First, participants in the Echinacea group had a higher susceptibility to colds than those in the placebo group. Second, participants in the Echinacea group reported less frequent use of classical pain medications and also of chlorphenamine, a codeine/cocodamol or pseudoephedrine. Adjusting for these covariates would most likely have resulted in an even higher effect, closer to the results reported from viral analyses and subgroups which shared similar anamnestic conditions. \nPrevious studies have described the problems associated with assessing cold infections purely on subjective symptomatic grounds. Therefore, we aimed to substantiate our data with virus analyses in nasal secretions. Viruses were successfully detected via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in about 60% of samples. It was difficult to draw conclusions about specific viruses, due to the low overall number of samples. Therefore, we aimed to confirm our previous in vitro data, which showed that Echinacea had strong antiviral effects against membranous viruses. Indeed, upon pooling the incidences of Influenza, Parainfluenza, RSV, Metapneumovirus, or Coronaviruses, we found 47 total infections in the placebo group and only 24 infections in the Echinacea group (P = 0.0114, chi-square test). The individual reduction on infection depended of the respective virus type. These results were fully consistent with previous studies by Pleschka et al. that demonstrated similar antiviral effects with the same preparation used in the present study. \n5. Conclusion\nThe present work described the largest clinical trial to date that tested the safety and efficacy of Echinacea and investigated its risk/benefit in a long-term treatment. Prophylactic treatment with Echinaforce over 4 months appeared to be beneficial for many reasons. First, Echinaforce showed an advantageous safety profile; it did not induce any health risk above that reported with the placebo treatment. Second, prolonged treatment with Echinaforce was associated with significant therapeutic benefits.\nOverall, the risk/benefit results from this clinical study suggested that long-term treatment with E. purpurea over 4 months can be recommended. \nTransmission of the common cold to volunteers under controlled conditions.

which is abundantly expressed after activation of T cells.\n Eta- 1 encodes a highly acidic secreted product having structural features of proteins that bind to cellular adhesion receptors.\n The Eta-1 gene maps to a locus on murine chromosome 5 termed Ric that confers resistance to infection by Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (RT), an obligate intracellular bacterium that is the etiological agent for human scrub typhus.\n With one exception, inbred mouse strains that expressed the Eta- 1a allele were resistant to RT infection (RicR), and inbred strains expressing the Eta-1b allele were susceptible (RicS).\n These findings suggest that Eta-1 is the gene inferred from previous studies of the Ric locus (5).\n Genetic resistance to RT infection is associated with a strong Eta-1 response in vivo and inhibition of early bacterial replication.\n Eta-1 gene expression appears to be part of a surprisingly rapid T cell-dependent response to bacterial infection that may precede classical

Immunomodulation","abstract":"Simple Summary\nAnti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4-based immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy have recently emerged as a breakthrough in human cancer treatment.\n\n Durable efficacy has been achieved in many types of human cancers.\n\n However, not all human cancers respond to current ICB immunotherapy and only a fraction of the responsive cancers exhibit efficacy.\n\n Osteopontin (OPN) expression is highly elevated in human cancers and functions as a tumor promoter.\n\n Emerging data suggest that OPN may also regulate immune cell function in the tumor microenvironment.\n\n This review aims at OPN function in human cancer progression and new findings of OPN as a new immune checkpoint.\n\n We propose that OPN compensates PD-L1 function to promote tumor immune evasion, which may underlie human cancer non-response to current ICB immunotherapy.\n\n\nAbstract\nOPN is a multifunctional phosphoglycoprotein expressed in a wide range of cells, including osteoclasts, osteoblasts, neurons, epithelial cells, T, B, NK, NK T, myeloid, and innate lymphoid cells.\n\n OPN plays an important role in diverse biological processes and is implicated in multiple diseases such as cardiovascular, diabetes, kidney, proinflammatory, fibrosis, nephrolithiasis, wound healing, and cancer.\n\n In cancer patients, overexpressed OPN is often detected in the tumor microenvironment and elevated serum OPN level is correlated with poor prognosis.\n\n Initially identified in activated T cells and termed as early T cell activation gene, OPN links innate cells to adaptive cells in immune response to infection and cancer.\n\n Recent single cell RNA sequencing revealed that OPN is primarily expressed in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in human cancer patients.\n\n Emerging experimental data reveal a key role of OPN is tumor immune evasion through regulating macrophage polarization, recruitment, and inhibition of T cell activation in the tumor microenvironment.\n\n Therefore, in addition to its well-established direct tumor cell promotion function, OPN also acts as an immune checkpoint to negatively regulate T cell activation.\n\n The OPN protein level is highly elevated in peripheral blood of human cancer patients.\n\n OPN blockade immunotherapy with OPN neutralization monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) thus represents an attractive approach in human cancer immunotherapy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7698217","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Hannah

ulcerative colitis (UC), and n?=?1505 healthy unrelated controls) was analyzed for nine OPN SNPs (rs2728127, rs2853744, rs11730582, rs11739060, rs28357094, rs4754?=?p.\n\nAsp80Asp, rs1126616?=?p.\n\nAla236Ala, rs1126772 and rs9138).\n\n Considering the important role of osteopontin in Th17-mediated diseases, we performed analysis for epistasis with IBD-associated IL23R variants and analyzed serum levels of the Th17 cytokine IL-22. For four OPN SNPs (rs4754, rs1126616, rs1126772 and rs9138), we observed significantly different distributions between male and female CD patients.\n\n rs4754 was protective in male CD patients (p?=?0.0004, OR?=?0.69).\n\n None of the other investigated OPN SNPs was associated with CD or UC susceptibility.\n\n However, several OPN haplotypes showed significant associations with CD susceptibility.\n\n The strongest association was found for a haplotype consisting of the 8 OPN SNPs rs2728127-rs2853744-rs11730582-rs11439060-rs28357094-rs112661-rs1126772-rs9138 (omnibus p-value?=?2.07×10?8).\n\n Overall, the mean IL-22 secretion in the combined group of OPN minor allele carriers with CD was significantly lower than that of CD patients with OPN wildtype alleles (p?=?3.66×10?5).\n\n There was evidence for weak epistasis between the OPN SNP rs28357094 with the IL23R SNP rs10489629 (p?=?4.18×10?2) and between OPN SNP rs1126616 and IL23R SNP rs2201841 (p?=?4.18×10?2) but none of these associations remained significant after Bonferroni correction.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nOur study identified OPN haplotypes as modifiers of CD susceptibility, while the combined effects of certain OPN variants may modulate IL-22 secretion.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3248444","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

contribution of genetic factors.\n\n Pakistan, which resides within the Afro-Asian stone belt, has a high reported prevalence (12%) of urolithiasis.\n\n Osteopontin (SPP1) is a urinary macromolecule with a suggested critical role in modulating renal stone formation, genetic polymorphisms of which may determine individual risk of developing urolithiasis.\n\n However, results of previous studies regarding SPP1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to urolithiasis have apparent inconsistencies with no data available for local population.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>A total of 235 urolithiasis patients

consequences of the presence of a disordered mineral layer to their functionality.\n In this work, the regulatory effect of recombinant osteopontin on biomimetic apatite is shown to produce platelet-shaped apatite crystallites with disordered layers coating them.\n The protein is also shown to regulate the content and properties of the disordered mineral phase (and sublayers within it).\n Through solid-state NMR atomic carbon-phosphorous distance measurements, the protein is shown to be located in the disordered phases, reaching out to interact with the surfaces of the crystals only through very few sidechains.\n These observations suggest that non-phosphorylated osteopontin acts as regulator of the coating mineral layers and exerts its effect on apatite crystal growth processes mostly from afar with a limited number of contact points with the crystal.\n","id":"PMC7518277","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

Basis of Recognition of Human Osteopontin by 23C3, a Potential Therapeutic Antibody for Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis","abstract":"Osteopontin plays an important role in the development and perpetuation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n Antibodies targeting osteopontin have shown promising therapeutic benefits against this disease.\n We have previously reported a novel anti-RA monoclonal antibody, namely, 23C3, and shown it capable of alleviating the symptoms of RA in a murine collagen-induced arthritis model, restoring the cytokine production profile in joint tissues, and reducing T-cell recall responses to collagen type II.\n We describe here the crystal structure of 23C3 in complex with its epitope peptide.\n Analyses of the complex structure reveal the molecular mechanism of osteopontin recognition by 23C3. The peptide folds into two tandem ?-turns, and two key residues of the peptide are identified to be critical for the recognition by 23C3: TrpP43 is deeply embedded into a hydrophobic pocket formed by AlaL34, TyrL36, LeuL46, TyrL49, PheL91, and MetH102 and therefore has extensive hydrophobic interactions with 23C3, while AspP47 has a network of hydrophilic interactions with residues ArgH50, ArgH52, SerH53, and AsnH56 of the antibody.\n Besides the complementarity-determining region loops, the framework region L2 of 23C3 is also shown to interact with the epitope peptide, which is not common in the antibody–antigen interactions and thus could be exploited in the engineering of 23C3. These results not only provide valuable information for further improvement of 23C3 such as chimerization or humanization for its therapeutic application, but also reveal the features of this specific epitope of osteopontin that may be useful for the development of new antibody drugs against RA.\n","id":"PMC2793339","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Jiamu","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sheng","surname":"Hou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianxin","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dapeng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yajun","surname":"Guo","email":"yjguo@smmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Ding","email":"jpding@sibs.ac.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1006/bbrc.1999.0412","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection

Resistance","abstract":"Simple Summary\nGrowth factors are hormone-like molecules able to promote division and migration of normal cells, but cancer captured the underlying mechanisms to unleash tumor growth and metastasis.\n\n Here we review the epidermal growth factor (EGF), which controls epithelial cells, the precursors of all carcinomas, and the cognate cell surface receptor, called EGFR.\n\n In addition to over-production of EGF and its family members in tumors, EGFR is similarly over-produced, and mutant hyper-active forms of EGFR are uniquely found in some brain, lung, and other cancers.\n\n After describing the biochemical mechanisms underlying the cancer-promoting actions of EGFR, we review some of the latest research discoveries and list all anti-cancer drugs specifically designed to block the EGFR’s biochemical pathway.\n\n We conclude by explaining why some patients with lung or colorectal cancer do not respond to the anti-EGFR therapies and why still other patients, who initially respond, become tolerant to the drugs.\n\n\nAbstract\nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has served as the founding member of the large family of growth factor receptors harboring intrinsic tyrosine kinase function.\n\n High abundance of EGFR and large internal deletions are frequently observed in brain tumors, whereas point mutations and small insertions within the kinase domain are common in lung cancer.\n\n For these reasons EGFR and its preferred heterodimer partner, HER2/ERBB2, became popular targets of anti-cancer therapies.\n\n Nevertheless, EGFR research keeps revealing unexpected observations, which are reviewed herein.\n\n Once activated by a ligand, EGFR initiates a time-dependent series of molecular switches comprising downregulation of a large cohort of microRNAs, up-regulation of newly synthesized mRNAs, and covalent protein modifications, collectively controlling phenotype-determining genes.\n\n In addition to microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs play critical roles in EGFR signaling.\n\n Along with driver mutations, EGFR drives metastasis in many ways.\n\n Paracrine loops comprising tumor and stromal cells enable EGFR to fuel invasion across tissue barriers, survival of clusters of circulating tumor cells, as well as colonization of distant organs.\n\n We conclude by listing all clinically approved anti-cancer drugs targeting either EGFR or HER2. Because emergence of drug resistance is nearly inevitable, we discuss the major evasion mechanisms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8197917","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Mary

Regulation of Osteopontin Production by Dendritic Cells Through the Bidirectional Interaction With Mesenchymal Stromal Cells","abstract":"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) exert immunosuppressive effects on immune cells including dendritic cells (DCs).\n However, many details of the bidirectional interaction of MSCs with DCs are still unsolved and information on key molecules by which DCs can modulate MSC functions is limited.\n Here, we report that osteopontin (OPN), a cytokine involved in homeostatic and pathophysiologic responses, is constitutively expressed by DCs and regulated in the DC/MSC cocultures depending on the activation state of MSCs.\n Resting MSCs promoted OPN production, whereas the production of OPN was suppressed when MSCs were activated by proinflammatory cytokines (i.\ne.\n, TNF-?, IL-6, and IL-1?).\n OPN induction required cell-to-cell contact, mediated at least in part, by ?1 integrin (CD29).\n Conversely, activated MSCs inhibited the release of OPN via the production of soluble factors with a major role played by Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).\n Accordingly, pretreatment with indomethacin significantly abrogated the MSC-mediated suppression of OPN while the direct addition of exogenous PGE2 inhibited OPN production by DCs.\n Furthermore, DC-conditioned medium promoted osteogenic differentiation of MSCs with a concomitant inhibition of adipogenesis.\n These effects were paralleled by the repression of the adipogenic markers PPAR?, adiponectin, and FABP4, and induction of the osteogenic markers alkaline phosphatase, RUNX2, and of the bone-anabolic chemokine CCL5. Notably, blocking OPN activity with RGD peptides or with an antibody against CD29, one of the OPN receptors, prevented the effects of DC-conditioned medium on MSC differentiation and CCL5 induction.\n Because MSCs have a key role in maintenance of bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cell niche through reciprocal regulation with immune cells, we investigated the possible MSC/DC interaction in human BM by immunohistochemistry.\n Although DCs (CD1c+) are a small percentage of BM cells, we demonstrated colocalization of CD271+ MSCs with CD1c+ DCs in normal and myelodysplastic BM.\n OPN reactivity was observed in occasional CD1c+ cells in the proximity of CD271+ MSCs.\n Altogether, these results candidate OPN as a signal modulated by MSCs according to their activation status and involved in DC regulation of MSC differentiation.\n","id":"PMC5992779","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

osteoblast differentiation","abstract":"Background\nSonic hedgehog (Shh) and components of its signalling pathway have been identified in human prostate carcinoma and increased levels of their expression appear to correlate with disease progression and metastasis.\n\n The mechanism through which Shh signalling could promote metastasis in bone, the most common site for prostate carcinoma metastasis, has not yet been investigated.\n\n The present study determined the effect of Shh signalling between prostate cancer cells and pre-osteoblasts on osteoblast differentiation, a requisite process for new bone formation that characterizes prostate carcinoma metastasis.\n\n\nResults\nLNCaP human prostate cancer cells modified to overexpress Shh (designated LNShh cells) and MC3T3 mouse pre-osteoblasts were maintained as mixed populations within the same culture chamber.\n\n In this non-conventional mixed culture system, LNShh cells upregulated the expression of Shh target genes Gli1 and Patched 1 (Ptc1) in MC3T3 cells and this was inhibited by cyclopamine, a specific chemical inhibitor of hedgehog signalling.\n\n Concomitantly, MC3T3 cells exhibited time-dependent decreased cell proliferation, upregulated alkaline phosphatase Akp2 gene expression, and increased alkaline phosphatase activity indicative of early phase osteoblast differentiation.\n\n LNShh cell-induced differentiation was inhibited in MC3T3 cells stably transfected with a dominant negative form of Gli1, a transcription factor that mediates Shh signalling.\n\n Interestingly, LNShh cells did not significantly increase the endogenous expression of the osteoblast differentiation transcription factor Runx2 and its target genes osteocalcin and osteopontin.\n\n Consistent with these results, exogenous Shh peptide did not upregulate Runx2 expression in MC3T3 cells.\n\n However, Runx2 levels were increased in MC3T3 cells by ascorbic acid, a known stimulator of osteoblast differentiation.\n\n\nConclusion\nAltogether, these data demonstrate that Shh-expressing prostate cancer cells can directly and specifically induce differentiation in pre-osteoblasts via a Gli1-dependent mechanism that does not require transcriptional upregulation of Runx2.\n\n Paracrine activation of the Shh pathway in osteoblast progenitors and subsequent induction of osteoblast differentiation could be a mechanism through which high levels of Shh expression in prostate carcinoma contribute to bone metastasis.\n\n Targeting of paracrine Shh signalling may provide an effective therapeutic strategy against prostate carcinoma metastasis in bone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2654862","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Samantha

microsatellite instable colorectal cancer (MSI, ~4% total cases), is one of the few human cancers that does not respond to current immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) immunotherapy.\n\n CTLs are present in both MSI and microsatellite stable (MSS) human colon carcinoma, suggesting that PD-L1-independent mechanisms may exist and suppress CTL activation in the colon tumor microenvironment.\n\n We

for anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements is important because of the dramatically favorable therapy response to ALK inhibitor.\n However, the exact mechanism of poor

fusion by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\n As results, there were no cases of coexisting EGFR and ALK mutations identified.\n Fourteen cases (2.7%) harbored ALK fusion, including eight solid adenocarcinomas with signet ring cell features, four acinar adenocarcinomas with cribriform pattern containing mucin, one adenosquamous carcinoma and one micropapillary adenocarcinoma with mucin.\n Six (42.9%) of fourteen patients with ALK-positive lung cancer had stage IV disease, and five ALK-positive patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy had poor outcome (all patients were dead and the mean survival time was 12 months), compared to 72 months for patients with ALK inhibitor therapy.\n Furthermore, Five ALK-positive cases were analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES) and via direct transcript counting using a digital probe-base (NanoString) to explore the driver genes.\n Deregulation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in ALK-positive lung cancer was demonstrated by WES analysis, and significantly increased mRNA of ALK, ROS1, MET, SPP1 and PI3K signaling pathway was identified by NanoString assay.\n The concordance between NanoString, IHC and FISH methodologies for detecting ALK fusion was 100%.\n Significant overexpression of SPP1 protein in ALK-positive lung cancer was confirmed by IHC compared to paired

breast cancer (BC), but the molecular mechanisms behind this risk is yet undetermined and prevention strategies for these women are lacking.\n The anti-estrogen tamoxifen may reduce the risk of BC but

which is key in carcinogenesis.\n OPN may be cleaved by proteases in the tissue and cleaved OPN may in turn induce an inflammatory cascade in the extracellular microenvironment.\n We aimed to determine if extracellular OPN was altered in BC and in normal breast tissue with different densities and if tamoxifen or a diet of flaxseed could modify OPN levels.\n The study comprised 103 women; 13 diagnosed with BC, 42 healthy post-menopausal women with different breast densities at their mammography screen, and 34 post-menopausal women who added 25 g of ground flaxseed/day or were treated with tamoxifen 20 mg/day and were investigated before and after 6 weeks of exposure.\n Additionally, 10 premenopausal women who added flaxseed for one menstrual cycle and four who were investigated in two unexposed consecutive luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.\n Microdialysis was used to sample extracellular proteins in vivo in breast tissue and proteins were quantified using a multiplex

biomarkers for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer.\n\n Objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic test characteristics of plasma osteopontin (OPN) in detecting ovarian malignancy and comparing its performance with CA125.\nMaterials and Methods:\nThis is a prospective cross-sectional diagnostic test evaluation.\n\n Women with adnexal mass detected by clinical or radiological examination were

Alterations Associated with Acquired Drug Resistance during Combined Treatment with Encorafenib and Binimetinib in Melanoma Cell Lines","abstract":"Simple Summary\nMelanoma is the most aggressive, deadliest form of skin cancer.\n\n Combined BRAF-MEK inhibitor (BRAFi/MEKi) therapy was a breakthrough in the treatment of melanoma with BRAFV600-mutations.\n\n However, many patients frequently develop drug resistance to the combinatory treatment.\n\n The aim of our study was to characterize the molecular background behind acquired resistance to BRAFi/MEKi-s.\n\n After the successful development of resistant cell lines, we investigated the invasion properties, changes in gene and protein expressions, as well as the effect of the “drug holiday” of the resistant cell lines.\n\n Drug-resistant melanoma cells had a higher invasive potential and acquired a spindle-like structure, and many cancer-related proteins were overexpressed in the resistant cells.\n\n Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes are functionally linked to a variety of biological functions that may lead to resistance to the inhibitors.\n\n These results may offer valuable insight into further understanding of BRAFi/MEKi resistance, as well as to the development of therapeutic tools to overcome drug resistance.\n\n\nAbstract\nCombination treatment using BRAF/MEK inhibitors is a promising therapy for patients with advanced BRAFV600E/K mutant melanoma.\n\n However, acquired resistance largely limits the clinical efficacy of this drug combination.\n\n Identifying resistance mechanisms is essential to reach long-term, durable responses.\n\n During this study, we developed six melanoma cell lines with acquired resistance for BRAFi/MEKi treatment and defined the molecular alterations associated with drug resistance.\n\n We observed that the invasion of three resistant cell lines increased significantly compared to the sensitive cells.\n\n RNA-sequencing analysis revealed differentially expressed genes that were functionally linked to a variety of biological functions including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, the ROS pathway, and KRAS-signalling.\n\n Using proteome profiler array, several differentially expressed proteins were detected, which clustered into a unique pattern.\n\n Galectin showed increased expression in four resistant cell lines, being the highest in the WM1617E+BRes cells.\n\n We also observed that the resistant cells behaved differently after the withdrawal of the inhibitors, five were not drug addicted at all and did not exhibit significantly increased lethality; however, the viability of one resistant cell line (WM1617E+BRes) decreased significantly.\n\n We have selected three resistant cell lines to investigate the protein expression changes after drug withdrawal.\n\n The expression patterns of CapG, Enolase 2, and osteopontin were similar in the resistant cells after ten days of “drug holiday”, but the Snail protein was only expressed in the WM1617E+BRes cells, which showed a drug-dependent phenotype, and this might be associated with drug addiction.\n\n Our results highlight that melanoma cells use several types of resistance mechanisms involving the altered expression of different proteins to bypass drug treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8656772","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Vikas","surname":"Patel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"István","surname":"Szász","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Viktória","surname":"Koroknai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tímea","surname":"Kiss","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Margit","surname":"Balázs","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Dumaz","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Dumaz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Dumaz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.wneu.2019.06.219","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Identification

interactions among various cell types and soluble factors present in prostate tissue.\n We found upregulation of Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells c1 (NFATc1) in human PCa and cultured PCa cells, but not in normal prostates and non-tumorigenic prostate cells.\n To understand the role of NFATc1 in prostate tumorigenesis in situ, we temporally and spatially controlled the activation of NFATc1 in mouse prostate and showed that such activation resulted in prostatic adenocarcinoma with features similar to those seen in human PCa.\n Our results indicate that the activation of a single transcription factor, NFATc1 in prostatic luminal epithelium to PCa can affect expression of diverse factors in both cells harboring the genetic changes and in neighboring cells through microenvironmental alterations.\n In addition to the activation of oncogenes c-MYC and STAT3 in tumor cells, a number of cytokines and growth factors, such as IL1?, IL6, and SPP1 (Osteopontin, a key biomarker for PCa), were upregulated in NFATc1-induced PCa, establishing a tumorigenic microenvironment involving both NFATc1 positive and negative cells for prostate tumorigenesis.\n To further characterize interactions between genes involved in prostate tumorigenesis, we generated mice with both NFATc1 activation and Pten inactivation in prostate.\n We showed that NFATc1 activation led to acceleration of Pten-null–driven prostate tumorigenesis by overcoming the PTEN loss–induced cellular senescence through inhibition of p21 activation.\n This study provides direct in vivo evidence of an oncogenic role of NFATc1 in prostate tumorigenesis and reveals multiple functions of NFATc1 in activating oncogenes, in inducing proinflammatory cytokines, in oncogene addiction, and in overcoming cellular senescence, which suggests calcineurin-NFAT signaling as a potential target in preventing PCa.\n","id":"PMC5012433","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"NULL","authors":[{"firstname":"Kalyan

malignant ductal cells were identified through calculating copy number variation (CNV) scores.\n The robust markers of malignant ductal cells in PDAC were found.\n Five immune-related signatures, including SPP1, LINC00683, SNHG10, LINC00237, and CASC19, were used to develop a risk score formula to predict the overall survival of PDAC patients.\n We also constructed an easy-to-use nomogram, combining risk score, N stage, and margin status.\n The expression level of SPP1 was related to the prognosis and immune regulators.\n We found that SPP1 was mainly expressed in ductal cells and macrophages in PDAC.\n In conclusion, we constructed a promising prognostic model based on immune-related signatures for PDAC using scRNA-seq and TCGA_PAAD

morbidity and mortality, which has sex-related differences in prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy.\n However, the difference in the mechanisms remains unclear.\n Macrophages, characterized by high plasticity and heterogeneity, act as one of the key cells that exert anti-tumor effects in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and play a complicated role in the process of tumor progression.\n To elucidate the subtype composition and functional heterogeneity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in NSCLC and further compare the sex-mediated differences, we conducted a single-cell level analysis in early-stage smoking NSCLC patients, combined with ssGSEA analysis, pseudotime ordering, and SCENIC analysis.\n We found two universally presented immune-suppressive TAMs with different functional and metabolic characteristics in the TME of NSCLC.\n Specifically, CCL18+ macrophages exerted immune-suppressive effects by inhibiting the production of inflammatory factors and manifested high levels of fatty acid oxidative phosphorylation metabolism.\n Conversely, the main metabolism pathway for SPP1+ macrophage was glycolysis which contributed to tumor metastasis by promoting angiogenesis and matrix remodeling.\n In terms of the differentially expressed genes, the complement gene C1QC and the matrix remodeling relevant genes FN1 and SPP1 were differentially expressed in the TAMs between sexes, of which the male upregulated SPP1 showed the potential as an ideal target for adjuvant immunotherapy and improving the efficacy of immunotherapy.\n According to the early-stage TCGA-NSCLC cohort, high expression of the above three genes in immune cells were associated with poor prognosis and acted as independent prognostic factors.\n Moreover, through verification at the transcription factor, transcriptome, and protein levels, we found that TAMs from women showed stronger immunogenicity with higher interferon-producing and antigen-presenting ability, while men-derived TAMs upregulated the PPARs and matrix remodeling related pathways, thus were more inclined to be immunosuppressive.\n Deconstruction of the TAMs at the single-cell level deepens our understanding of the mechanism for tumor occurrence and progress, which could be helpful to achieve the precise sex-specific tumor treatment sooner.\n","id":"PMC8602907","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

This study aimed to explore new molecular biomarker for early lymph node metastasis in LUAD using transcriptome sequencing and experimental validation.\n Here, we performed transcriptome sequencing on tissues from 16 matched patients with Stage-T1 LUAD (eight cases of lymph node metastasis and eight cases of non-metastasis), and verified the transcriptome profiles in TCGA, GSE68465, and GSE43580 cohorts.\n With the bioinformatics analysis, we identified a higher abundance of M0 macrophages in the metastatic group using the CIBERSORT algorithm and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis and the enrichment of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway was identified in patients with higher M0 infiltration levels.\n Subsequently, the EMT hallmark gene SPP1, encoding secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), was identified to be significantly correlated with macrophage infiltration and M2 polarization, and was determined to be a key risk indicator for early lymph node metastasis.\n Notably, SPP1 in the blood, as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed a superior predictive capability for early lymph node metastasis [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.74].\n Furthermore, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA, AC037441), negatively correlated with SPP1 and macrophage infiltration, had also been identified and validated to be involved in the regulation of early lymph node metastasis.\n In conclusion, we revealed the potential role of macrophages in lymph node metastasis and identified the macrophage-related gene SPP1 as a potential biomarker for early

Integrin-linked kinase and PI3-kinase are integral proteins in OPN/AKT pathway in PC3 cells.\n\n To investigate the role of the extracellular receptors in OPN signaling, we have examined the spatio-temporal regulation of CD44 and integrin ?v?3 receptor in OPN-induced Akt activation in PC3 cells.\n\n\nResults\nHere, our studies demonstrate that OPN can activate Akt either through the ?V?3 integrin or the CD44 cell surface receptor.\n\n Members of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) family have been shown to be up-regulated in a variety of human cancers and have been implicated in the metastatic behavior.\n\n Our studies have demonstrated an increase in the phosphorylation of c-Raf at Ser259 and Ser338 in PC3 cells over-expressing OPN.\n\n This increase matches up with the Erk1/2 phosphorylation at Thr202/204 and activation.\n\n However, the inhibition of Akt activity augments the phosphorylation state of ERK1/2 to two to three fold with a concomitant reduction in the

dual effects in the activation of Erk1/2. We propose this based on the observations that while OPN activates c-Raf and Erk1/2; it also acts to inhibit c-Raf and Erk1/2 activation through Akt pathway.\n\n Our observations suggest that the activation of c-Raf-ERK cascade may promote cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells and OPN signaling has a role in the anti-apoptotic

siSPP1 was used to knock down SSP1 in afatinib-resistant lung cancer cells.\n Then sensitivity to afatinib and invasive ability were studied.\n We found that knockdown of SPP1 increased sensitivity of lung cancer cells to afatinib and decrease the ability of invasion.\n Of clinical significance, we found that SSP1 was upregulated in lung cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and low level of SSP1 was strongly associated with better overall survival.\n Our results suggest that SPP1 enhanced the second-generation EGFR TKI resistance in lung cancer, and inhibiting SPP1 might be a

the expression of VEGF.\n An inhibitor to MEK or curcumin significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and expression of VEGF.\n MMP9 knockdown reduces the secretion but not the expression of VEGF.\n Moreover, MMP9 knockdown increases the release of angiostatin, a key protein that suppresses angiogenesis.\n Conditioned media from PC3 cells treated with curcumin or MEK inhibitor inhibited tube formation in vitro in human microvascular endothelial cells.\n Similar inhibitory effect on tube formation was found with conditioned media collected from PC3 cells expressing mutant-osteopontin at integrin-binding site and knockdown of osteopontin or MMP9. We conclude that MMP9 activation is associated with angiogenesis via regulation of secretion of VEGF and angiostatin in PC3 cells.\n Curcumin is thus a potential drug for cancer treatment because it

these effects.\n The study focused on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and glial cells (astrocytes, Müller cells, and resident microglia) in 3- and 20-month-old mice.\n The number of RGCs in the retina was quantified and the area occupied by astrocytes was measured.\n In addition, the morphology of Müller cells and microglia was examined in retinal sections.\n The deficiency in OPN reduces RGC density by 25.09% at 3 months of age and by 60.37% at 20 months of age.\n The astrocyte area was also reduced by 51.01% in 3-month-old mice and by 57.84% at 20 months of age, although Müller glia and microglia did not seem to be affected by the lack of OPN.\n This study demonstrates the influence of OPN on astrocytes and RGCs, whereby the absence of OPN in the retina diminishes the area occupied by astrocytes and produces a secondary reduction in the number of RGCs.\n Accordingly, OPN could be a target to develop therapies to combat neurodegenerative diseases and astrocytes may represent a

of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).\n However, the substrate repertoire of ADAMTS8 and regulation of its activity are incompletely understood.\n Although considered a proteoglycanase because of high sequence similarity and close phylogenetic relationship to the proteoglycan-degrading proteases ADAMTS1, 4, 5, and 15, as well as tight genetic linkage with ADAMTS15 on human chromosome 11, its aggrecanase activity was reportedly weak.\n Several post-translational factors are known to regulate ADAMTS proteases such as autolysis, inhibition by endogenous inhibitors, and receptor-mediated endocytosis, but their impacts on ADAMTS8 are unknown.\n Here, we show that ADAMTS8 undergoes autolysis at six different sites within its spacer domain.\n We also found that in contrast to ADAMTS4 and 5, ADAMTS8 levels were not regulated through low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)-mediated endocytosis.\n Additionally, ADAMTS8 lacked significant activity against the proteoglycans aggrecan, versican, and biglycan.\n Instead, we found that ADAMTS8 cleaved osteopontin, a phosphoprotein whose expression is upregulated in PAH.\n Multiple ADAMTS8 cleavage sites were identified using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry.\n Osteopontin cleavage by ADAMTS8 was efficiently inhibited by TIMP-3, an endogenous inhibitor of ADAMTS1, 4, and 5, as well as by TIMP-2, which has no previously reported inhibitory activity against other ADAMTS proteases.\n These differences in post-translational regulation and substrate repertoire differentiate ADAMTS8 from other family members and may help to elucidate its role in PAH.\n","id":"PMC8577114","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular

circulation, ingested milk OPN may influence physiological processes.\n The aim of this study was to investigate OPN interaction with intestinal cells and its transport across models of the intestinal barrier.\n Immunodetection of OPN incubated with Caco-2 cells at 4 °C and 37 °C showed that OPN binds to the intestinal cells, but it is not internalised.\n Transepithelial transport was studied using mono- and co-cultures of Caco-2 cells and mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells in transwell membranes.\n OPN was shown to cross the barrier models in a time-, temperature-, and energy-dependent process inhibited by wortmannin, indicating that the transport takes place via the transcytosis pathway.\n Analyses of the naturally occurring milk mixture of full-length and N-terminal fragments showed that the N-terminal fragments of OPN bound intestinal cells most effectively and that the fragments were transported across the intestinal membrane models.\n This suggests that proteolytic processing of

participate in the niche produce varying amounts of OPN in response to stimulation.\n Using studies that combine OPN-deficient mice and exogenous OPN, we demonstrate that OPN modifies primitive hematopoietic cell number and function in a stem cell–nonautonomous manner.\n The OPN-null microenvironment was sufficient to increase the number of stem cells associated with increased stromal Jagged1 and Angiopoietin-1 expression and reduced primitive hematopoietic cell apoptosis.\n The activation of the stem cell microenvironment with parathyroid hormone induced a superphysiologic

Review and Meta-Analysis","abstract":"Simple Summary\nThe role of innate immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), more specifically the presence of the tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), is becoming more important in the prognosis and treatment of patients diagnosed with malignancies.\n\n The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the potential prognostic value of CD206-expressing TAMs, a subclass of macrophages, which were previously proposed to negatively impact the patient’s prognosis.\n\n We identified 27 manuscripts describing the role of CD206 in patient prognosis for 14 different tumor types.\n\n Despite a large heterogeneity in the results, we identified a significantly worse overall and disease-free survival for patients with increased CD206-expressing TAMs in the TME.\n\n The use of CD206-expressing TAMs could therefore be used as a prognostic marker in patients diagnosed with solid malignancies.\n\n\nAbstract\nAn increased presence of CD206-expressing tumor associated macrophages in solid cancers was proposed to be associated with worse outcomes in multiple types of malignancies, but contradictory results are published.\n\n We performed a reproducible systematic review and meta-analysis to provide increased evidence to confirm or reject this hypothesis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement.\n\n The Embase, Web of Science, and MEDLINE-databases were systematically searched for eligible manuscripts.\n\n A total of 27 papers studying the prognostic impact of CD206 in 14 different tumor types were identified.\n\n Meta-analyses showed a significant impact on the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).\n\n While no significant differences were revealed in progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS), a shift towards negative survival was correlated with increased CD206-expresion.\n\n As a result of the different tumor types, large heterogeneity was present between the different tumor types.\n\n Subgroup analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancers revealed no heterogeneity, associated with a significant negative impact on OS in both groups.\n\n The current systematic review displays the increased presence CD206-expressing macrophages as a significant negative prognostic biomarker for both OS and DFS in patients diagnosed with solid cancers.\n\n Because a heterogenous group of tumor types was included in the meta-analysis, the results cannot be generalized.\n\n These results can, however, be used to further lead follow-up research to validate the specific prognostic value of CD206 in individual tumor types and therapeutic approaches.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8305473","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Jens

antibody-mediated immunotherapy in adult T-cell leukemia","abstract":"Background\nAdult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a CD4+ T-cell neoplasm with a poor prognosis.\n\n A previous study has shown that there is a strong correlation between the secreted matricellular protein osteopontin (OPN) level and disease severity in ATL patients.\n\n Here, we investigated the role of OPN in ATL pathogenesis and the possible application of anti-OPN monoclonal antibody (mAb) for ATL immunotherapy in NOD/Shi-scid,IL-2Rgnull (NOG) mice.\n\n\nResults\nSubcutaneous inoculation of ATL cell lines into NOG mice increased the plasma level of OPN, which significantly correlated with metastasis of the inoculated cells and survival time.\n\n Administration of an SVVYGLR motif-recognizing anti-OPN mAb resulted in inhibition not only of tumor growth but also of tumor invasion and metastasis.\n\n The number of fibroblast activating protein-positive fibroblasts was also reduced by this mAb.\n\n We then co-inoculated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from wild-type (WT) or OPN knockout mice together with ATL-derived TL-OmI cells into the NOG mice.\n\n The mice co-inoculated with WT MEFs displayed a significant decrease in survival relative to those injected with TL-OmI cells alone and the absence of OPN in MEFs markedly improved the survival rate of TL-OmI-inoculated mice.\n\n In addition, tumor volume and metastasis were also reduced in the absence of OPN.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe showed that the xenograft NOG mice model can be a useful system for assessment of the physiological role of OPN in ATL pathogenesis.\n\n Using this xenograft model, we found that fibroblast-derived OPN was involved in tumor growth and metastasis, and that this tumor growth and metastasis was significantly suppressed by administration of the anti-OPN mAbs.\n\n Our findings will lead to a novel mAb-mediated immunotherapeutic strategy targeting against the interaction of OPN with integrins on the tumor of ATL patients.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12977-015-0225-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to

patients expression of OPN has been associated with poor prognosis in several tumor types including breast, lung, and colorectal cancers.\n Despite wide expression in tumor cells and stroma, there is limited evidence supporting role of OPN in tumor progression and metastasis.\n Using phage display technology we identified a high affinity anti-OPN monoclonal antibody (hereafter AOM1).\n The binding site for AOM1 was identified as SVVYGLRSKS sequence which is immediately adjacent to the RGD motif and also spans the thrombin cleavage site of the human OPN.\n AOM1 efficiently inhibited OPNa binding to recombinant integrin ?v?3 with an IC50 of 65 nM.\n Due to its unique binding site, AOM1 is capable of inhibiting OPN cleavage by thrombin which has been shown to produce an OPN fragment that is biologically more active than the full length OPN.\n Screening of human cell lines identified tumor cells with increased expression of OPN receptors (?v?3 and CD44v6) such as mesothelioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast, and non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLC).\n CD44v6 and ?v?3 were also found to be highly enriched in the monocyte, but not lymphocyte, subset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs).\n In vitro, OPNa induced migration of both tumor and hPBMCs in a transwell migration assay.\n AOM1 significantly blocked cell migration further validating its specificity for the ligand.\n OPN was found to be enriched in mouse plasma in a number of pre-clinical tumor model of non-small cell lung cancers.\n To assess the role of OPN in tumor growth and metastasis and to evaluate a potential therapeutic indication for AOM1, we employed a KrasG12D-LSLp53fl/fl subcutaneously implanted in vivo model of NSCLC which possesses a high capacity to metastasize into the lung.\n Our data indicated that treatment of tumor bearing mice with AOM1 as a single agent or in combination with Carboplatin significantly inhibited growth of large metastatic

Thrombin?Cleaved Osteopontin","abstract":"Background\nPressure overload of the heart occurs in patients with hypertension or valvular stenosis and induces cardiac fibrosis because of excessive production of extracellular matrix by activated cardiac fibroblasts.\n\n This initially provides essential mechanical support to the heart, but eventually compromises function.\n\n Osteopontin is associated with fibrosis; however, the underlying signaling mechanisms are not well understood.\n\n Herein, we examine the effect of thrombin?cleaved osteopontin on fibrosis in the heart and explore the role of syndecan?4 in regulating cleavage of osteopontin.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nOsteopontin was upregulated and cleaved by thrombin in the pressure?overloaded heart of mice subjected to aortic banding.\n\n Cleaved osteopontin was higher in plasma from patients with aortic stenosis receiving crystalloid compared with blood cardioplegia, likely because of less heparin?induced inhibition of thrombin.\n\n Cleaved osteopontin and the specific osteopontin peptide sequence RGDSLAYGLR that is exposed after thrombin cleavage both induced collagen production in cardiac fibroblasts.\n\n Like osteopontin, the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan?4 was upregulated after aortic banding.\n\n Consistent with a heparan sulfate binding domain in the osteopontin cleavage site, syndecan?4 was found to bind to osteopontin in left ventricles and cardiac fibroblasts and protected osteopontin from cleavage by thrombin.\n\n Shedding of the extracellular part of syndecan?4 was more prominent at later remodeling phases, at which time levels of cleaved osteopontin were increased.\n\n\nConclusions\nThrombin?cleaved osteopontin induces collagen production by cardiac fibroblasts.\n\n Syndecan?4 protects osteopontin from cleavage by thrombin, but this protection is lost when syndecan?4 is shed in later phases of remodeling, contributing to progression of cardiac fibrosis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7033859","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Kate

Update of the Interplay Between Bone and the Immune System","abstract":"Immunology, already a discipline in its own right, has become a major part of many different medical fields.\n However, its relationship to orthopedics and trauma surgery has unfortunately, and perhaps unjustly, been developing rather slowly.\n Discoveries in recent years have emphasized the immense breadth of communication and connection between both systems and, importantly, the highly promising therapeutic opportunities.\n Recent discoveries of factors originally assigned to the immune system have now also been shown to have a significant impact on bone health and disease, which has greatly changed how we approach treatment of bone pathologies.\n In case of bone fracture, immune cells, especially macrophages, are present throughout the whole healing process, assure defense against pathogens and discharge a complex variety of effectors to regulate bone modeling.\n In rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis, the immune system contributes to the formation of the pathological and chronic conditions.\n Fascinatingly, prosthesis failure is not at all solely a mechanical problem of improper strain but works in conjunction with an active contribution of the immune system as a reaction to irritant debris from material wear.\n Unraveling conjoined mechanisms of the immune and osseous systems heralds therapeutic possibilities for ailments of both.\n Contemplation of the bone as merely an unchanging support pillar is outdated and obsolete.\n Instead it is mandatory that this highly diverse network be incorporated in our understanding of the immune system and hematopoiesis.\n","id":"PMC7004969","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

Immune Privilege of the Intervertebral Disc: Implications for Intervertebral Disc Degeneration Treatment","abstract":"The intervertebral disc (IVD) is the largest avascular organ of the body.\n It is composed of three parts: the nucleus pulposus (NP), the annulus fibrosus (AF) and the cartilaginous endplate (CEP).\n The central NP is surrounded by the AF and sandwiched by the two CEPs ever since its formation.\n This unique structure isolates the NP from the immune system of the host.\n Additionally, molecular factors expressed in IVD have been shown inhibitive effect on immune cells and cytokines infiltration.\n Therefore, the IVD has been identified as an immune privilege organ.\n The steady state of immune privilege is fundamental to the homeostasis of the IVD.\n The AF and the CEP, along with the immunosuppressive molecular factors are defined as the blood-NP barrier (BNB), which establishes a strong barrier to isolate the NP from the host immune system.\n When the BNB is damaged, the auto-immune response of the NP occurs with various downstream cascade reactions.\n This effect plays an important role in the whole process of IVD degeneration and related complications, such as herniation, sciatica and spontaneous herniated NP regression.\n Taken together, an enhanced understanding of the immune privilege of the IVD could provide new targets for the treatment of symptomatic IVD disease.\n However, the underlying mechanism above is still not fully clarified.\n Accordingly, the current study will extensively review and discuss studies regarding the immune

369 diseases and injuries in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019","abstract":"Background\nIn an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential.\n\n The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries.\n\n\nMethods\nGBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories.\n\n Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources.\n\n Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression.\n\n Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates.\n\n Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs.\n\n A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes.\n\n Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs.\n\n We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years.\n\n Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution.\n\n\nFindings\nGlobal health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates.\n\n After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable.\n\n Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990–2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0–9-year age group.\n\n Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth).\n\n In adolescents aged 10–24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth).\n\n Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10–24 years were also in the top ten in the 25–49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth).\n\n In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50–74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups.\n\n Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries.\n\n In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden.\n\n Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAs disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies.\n\n With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes.\n\n The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates

countries and territories: a secondary analysis of the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study","abstract":"Objective\nTo evaluate the global burden of musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders, as well as the five common conditions, and their relevant risk factors from 1990 to 2019.\nDesign\nData from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 were used in this study.\n\n\nSetting and participants\nIndividuals of all ages and genders from 204 countries and territories in 21 regions.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nThe outcomes were the numbers and age-standardised rates (ASRs) of incident cases, deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of MSK disorders.\n\n The average annual percent changes (AAPCs) in the ASRs were calculated using joinpoint regression analysis to estimate the trends.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 322.75 million incident cases, 117.54 thousand deaths and 150.08 million DALYs of MSK disorders in 2019. The age-standardised incidence rate and age-standardised DALY rate in 2019 (incidence: AAPC=?0.32, 95% CI ?0.34 to ?0.31; DALYs: AAPC=?0.05, 95% CI ?0.06 to ?0.04) were lower than those in 1990. However, the age-standardised death rate showed a stable trend (AAPC 0.05, 95% CI ?0.05 to 0.15) from 1990 to 2019. The peak age of onset and DALYs of MSK disorders was 50–54 years in 2019. The burden of MSK disorders in females was much higher than that in males (1.29 times more incident cases, 2.24 times more deaths and 1.45 times more DALYs in females than in males).\n\n A significant negative correlation was observed between the AAPCs in the ASRs and the Sociodemographic Index (SDI) score.\n\n Occupational risk exhibited the highest contribution to MSK disorders, and tobacco use and high body mass index were also major risk factors.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates that the burden of MSK disorders tends to be lower in high-SDI regions than in lower-SDI regions.\n\n Strengthening the effectiveness of preventive measures against occupational risks may reduce the burden of MSK disorders.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9244680","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ

pathologies involving cartilage, subchondral bone and (increasingly recognized) inflammation of the synovium.\n The synovium may show significant changes, even before visible cartilage degeneration has occurred, with infiltration of mononuclear cells, thickening of the synovial lining layer and production of inflammatory cytokines.\n The combination of sensitive imaging modalities and tissue examination has confirmed a high prevalence of synovial inflammation in all stages of OA, with a number of studies demonstrating that synovitis is related to pain, poor function and may even be an independent driver of radiographic OA onset and structural progression.\n Treating key aspects of synovial inflammation therefore holds great promise for analgesia and also for structure modification.\n This article will review current knowledge on the prevalence of synovitis in OA and its role in symptoms and structural progression, and explore lessons learnt from targeting synovitis

due to chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), the dominant non-immune cells of synovial tissues, mainly contribute to joint destruction via multiple mechanisms.\n In RA, FLS respond to endogenous ligands of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and inflammatory cytokines as non-immune cells.\n In addition, FLS aid in the activation of immune responses by interacting with immune cells and by supporting ectopic lymphoid-like structure (ELS) formation in synovial tissues.\n Moreover, FLS directly cause the pathogenicity of RA

Introduction\nIntercontinental air travel can be stressful, adding extra strain on passenger's physical and psychological health. Studies have investigated the occurrence of nasal dryness, the increased risk of developing upper respiratory disorders such as allergic rhinitis and dry coughs, and attracting virus- or bacteria-induced respiratory infections such as the common cold during long-haul flights. Almost 50% of travellers experience some kind of illness while abroad, the most common being an upper respiratory infection, typically leading to 3-day debilitation during a 14-day trip. Acute respiratory tract infections like the common cold are mostly caused by rhinoviruses and respiratory viral infections are also recognised as the most frequent cause of acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \nTo reduce adverse reactions to long distance flights, various interventions such as air humidification and oxygen supplementation have been trialled; however, no research has investigated the possible benefit of a herbal medicine. Herbal medicines, amongst other complementary and alternative medicines, are used by over half of the population worldwide, and amongst the most widely used herbal medicines is Echinacea, with millions of units sold annually. \nDue to Echinacea's in vitro anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immuno-modulating effects, numerous clinical trials have investigated its efficacy for the treatment of the common cold. Although most studies demonstrated positive effects such as decreased severity and duration of symptoms of the common cold when Echinacea is given at first sign of infection, outcomes are inconsistent because of the variations in treatment protocols, applied outcome measures, and Echinacea preparations.\nPreparations from three different species, Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea purpurea, and Echinacea pallida, are generally referred to as Echinacea preparations; however their phytochemical profile and activity can differ significantly. Clinical trials mainly support efficacy for preparations from E. purpurea and partially E. angustifolia to treat symptoms of the common cold and to have an effect on stress-induced factors: hsp70 and white blood cell counts. Alkylamides are considered to be part of the active constituents in Echinacea as their bioavailability was confirmed by human pharmacokinetic studies with alkylamides detectable in plasma of healthy volunteers 30 minutes after Echinacea tablet ingestion. They have shown to affect the immune response through cannabinoid type 2 dependent and independent pathways, modulating the production of cytokines such as TNFalpha and IL-2.\n Echinacea's preventative effects for respiratory illness are still debated and difficult for consumers to ascertain. Some previous studies used artificial rhinovirus inoculation or were not blinded and placebo controlled. The aim of our research was to identify whether an alkylamide-standardised, bioavailable Echinacea formulation is safe and effective in the prevention of respiratory and other travel-related symptoms during travel involving long-haul flights.\n2. Material and Methods\n2.1. Study Design\nA randomised, double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial was conducted between February 2009 and May 2010 in Australia with economy class passengers travelling back, for a period of 1 to 5 weeks, from Australia to America, Europe, or Africa on commercial flights with a flying time of 15-25 hours and less than 12-hour stopovers. The clinical trial received ethical approval from the institutional Human Research Ethics Committee (PHM0608HREC) and was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (http://www.anzctr.org.au/ (ANZCTR 083687)).\n Figure 1 outlines the study design for a participant travelling for 35 days. For all participants treatment would commence 14 days before flying overseas and would complete 14 days after returning to Australia. The actual treatment time varied between participants depending on their travel duration. It ranged from a minimum of 5 weeks (if 7 days/1week of travel) to 9 weeks (if 35 days/5 weeks of travel).\nEach participant completed three surveys: at 14 days before travel (baseline), &lt;1 week after travel (return), and at 4 weeks after returning from travel (followup). The surveys contained questions relating to upper respiratory symptoms, jet lag duration, headache, sleep disturbances, and cold sore covering a period of the previous 4 weeks at each individual time point (baseline, return, and followup).\n2.2. Study Participants and Randomisation\nParticipants were recruited through travel agencies, radio, newspaper, and TV advertisements, and emails circulated to all staff and students at a university and a teaching hospital on the Gold Coast, Australia. Volunteers were included if they were 18-65 years of age, in good general health and suffered from no previous or current serious illness. Volunteers were excluded if they had a known plant allergy, were suffering from respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma, COPD), had any other condition that could compromise the study or the participants health (e.g., autoimmune disease, cystic fibrosis), had received flu vaccination within 20 days of starting the trial, were lactating, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, or were on regular treatment with Echinacea, antibiotics, corticosteroids, antihistamines, and immunosuppressants.\nOne hundred and seventy-five volunteers met the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to trial tablets. The random allocation sequence provided by the sponsor was computer generated using a randomisation plan from http://www.randomization.com/ with randomisation in blocks of 10. A list of consecutive study numbers was generated. Treatment groups were allocated by trial staff, but the allocation was concealed by providing each participant with a number. Participants, chief investigators, and trial staff were blinded to group allocation. To confirm that blinding was effective, a subgroup of participants (n = 11 on placebo and n = 10 on Echinacea) were asked to speculate whether they were taking Echinacea or placebo. Eleven participants identified themselves correctly, whereas 12 identified themselves incorrectly. There was an even distribution of mismatches in the placebo and Echinacea group providing further evidence of effective randomisation.\n2.3. Clinical Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis\nUpper respiratory symptom-related quality of life (QoL) was measured using the questions from the 44-item Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-44), which was the primary outcome variable. The WURSS-44 is a responsive, reliable, and valid instrument for evaluating QoL outcomes related to respiratory illness, measuring all significant health-related dimensions that are negatively affected by the common cold. It has been shown to be a more powerful instrument for assessing respiratory-related QoL then the general-health-related QoL, instrument SF-36 and measurements correlate well with laboratory-assessed biomarkers. The WURSS-44 includes 1 global severity item, 32 symptom-based items, 10 functional QoL items, and 1 global change item, all of which are based on 7-point Likert-type severity scales. A previous validation of the instrument showed that a cumulative score should be calculated by summing the severity scores of the first 43 items with high severity scores indicating high symptom load. The median WURSS-44 score was calculated and compared for both treatment groups using the nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for median differences in independent samples. Symptoms in our survey were assessed over the past 4 weeks rather than for the past 24 h to accommodate the travel trial setting. A minimal important difference (MID) is the term generally used to quantify the minimum amount of positive change that patients perceive and would accept an associated treatment as being beneficial or worth taking:a clinically significant effect. For the WURSS-44 score, an MID of 16.7 points was determined. Therefore, individuals that presented with a respiratory disorder symptoms score of 17 and above (RDS+) were compared in both groups at baseline, return, and followup. Difference in the prevalence (or proportion) of RDS+ individuals between groups at followup was statistically compared using a 2 x 2 chi-squared test of independence and the Odds Ratio. The amount of missing data was different among variables but on average was less than 10%. We analysed observed data, only that is, did not impute data or conduct missing at random analyses.\nIn addition 15 questions were designed and assessed as secondary outcome measures for occurrence and duration of jet lag, headache, sleep pattern, and herpes simplex sores. t-tests and chi-square tests were used to analyse differences between groups regarding headache, cold sore, and sleep disturbances. Results were considered significant when the P value was &lt;=0.05. All statistical analysis carried out was based on intention to treat (ITT) using the program PASW Statistics (SPSS) version 18.0.\nStudy participants were asked to complete a diary during the trial to record any upper respiratory symptoms, possible travel stress symptoms such as jet lag duration, headache, sleep disturbances, cold sore, headache, administration of sick dose, as well as additional health issues or disease symptoms and additional medication taken. The diary helped participants with recalling information when completing the surveys and allowed researchers to identify possible inconsistencies in data documentation. Participants were contacted by trial staff via phone a couple of days before leaving Australia and following their return to Australia, to ensure participants well-being, correct dosing, compliance, diary completion and to make final appointments. Participants were provided with an emergency phone number which they could contact 24 hours, 7 days a week, especially while being overseas.\n2.4. Sample Size Calculation\nStudies estimate the incidence of respiratory problems from 11%:in flight emergencies:based on respiratory problems to 50% health-related problems with the 2nd most common cause being respiratory problems. For this study it was estimated that 4 out of 10 participants in the placebo group (40%) will be RDS+ at followup compared to 20% in the Echinacea group, which equates to a clinically significant decreased risk of RDS (OR~2). It was also previously reported that using the WURSS-44 to assess symptomatic patients a two-armed RCT would require 92 participants in total to detect an MID as being statistically significant. We concluded that a sample size of approximately 180 would yield at least 80% power to detect a treatment effect as statistically significant at the 0.05 alpha level.\n2.5. Treatment\nThe Echinacea tablet preparation used was the commercially available Echinacea Premium tablets (MediHerb brand) manufactured by Integria Healthcare Pty Ltd. (AustL no. 75124) standardised to 4.4 mg alkylamides. The tablets contained 112.5 mg Echinacea purpurea 6 : 1 extract (equivalent to 675 mg dry root) and 150 mg Echinacea angustifolia 4 : 1 extract (equivalent to 600 mg dry root). Phytochemical profiles for these tablets were established for previous batches and also determined for the batch used in this study (Table 1). Placebo tablets were manufactured to match the Echinacea tablets in size, excipients, and colour. Both sets of tablets were coated with a brown colour and hypromellose to make them indistinguishable. Tablets were packed in identical amber glass bottles with identical labelling. Labelling only identified the patient number.\n2.6. Dosing\nFor our study medication, the manufacturer recommends for adult patients one tablet three times daily (3825 mg dry root equivalent/day) and if required an increase to two tablets three times daily. This lies within the dosage range commonly recommended for Echinacea formulations. For ease of adherence and compliance with the dosing schedules whilst travelling and experiencing time zone changes, dosing was undertaken twice daily, either as one tablet (priming, overseas, and after-travel dose) or two tablets during the stressful flying time (flying dose). An example of the protocol for 5 weeks of travel is given below in Table 2 (also see Figure 1 for study layout), with Day 0 being the first day of travel and Day 35 being the return day. For shorter travel periods, the period for the overseas dose between days 8 and 32 was shortened, reflecting the time the participant was spending abroad. All other dosing, before and after travel including during the washout period, remained the same for each participant.\nParticipants were allowed to take a sick dose (three tablets twice a day) if cold- or flu-like symptoms occurred. The sick dose could only be taken for up to 8 consecutive days or twice for 4 days during the whole travel period. Compliance was assessed by calculating the percentage of tablets taken against total tablets expected to be taken of the treatment period.\n3. Results\nThe flow of participants through the trial between February 2009 and May 2010 is summarised in Figure 2. Six hundred and fifty-eight people were screened, with a number deemed ineligible by inclusion criteria: plant allergy, inappropriate destination, and/or extended stopovers during travel (&gt;12 h). Reasons for declining participation included not wanting to be on placebo, travel cancellation, tablet size, and personal circumstances. Of the 175 trial participants, 170 completed the initial survey. Thus ITT analysis was performed on 170 participants. All three completed surveys were returned by 143 participants while 27 were lost to followup.\n3.1. Baseline Analysis\nOf the 170 participants analysed, 85 were assigned Echinacea tablets and 85 were assigned placebo. Sixty-seven percent of participants were women.  Table 3 shows the baseline characteristics of the trial groups. On average, participants were 43 years old, weight 76 kg, had normal blood pressure, and travelled for 23 days. Travel was mostly holiday related. There were no statistically significant differences between the Echinacea and placebo group for the test variables at baseline (Table 3). Thus, the two treatment groups can be considered reasonably well balanced at baseline.\n3.2. Primary Outcomes\n Figure 3 shows the median WURSS-44 symptom scores for the placebo and Echinacea group at each time point. Compared to baseline (before travel), the average WURSS-44 scores for both groups increased during travel (measured retrospectively at return) (P &lt; 0.0005). When comparing both groups with each other at each individual time point, the WURSS-44 scores did not differ significantly before travel (baseline) (P = 0.17) and during the 4 weeks after travel (measured retrospectively at followup) (P = 0.18). However, at during travel (measured retrospectively at return), the placebo group had significantly higher WURSS-44 scores on average compared to the Echinacea group (26 versus 13, P = 0.05).\nWhen comparing the percentage of participants considering themselves to be affected by respiratory illness (score &gt; 17), there was no significant difference between both groups at baseline (before travel) (P = 0.19). However, the results from the survey completed immediately after return from travel showed a significantly reduced percentage of RDS+ affected participants in the Echinacea group compared to placebo (43% versus 57%, P = 0.05) during travel. This difference was further substantiated during the 4 weeks after travel (survey at followup) where there was a significantly lower percentage of illness in the Echinacea-treated group compared to placebo (i.e., 25% versus 39%) which corresponds to ~50% relative reduction (P = 0.03). This implies that patients will be 50% less likely to suffer respiratory disorder symptoms scores of 17 and above (RDS+), which they consider treatment worthy.\n3.3. Secondary Outcomes\nGiven Echinacea's anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects we also investigated whether this herbal medicine could be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of headache and cold sores, respectively. However, there was no significant difference between the placebo and Echinacea group with regards to sleep disturbances and the prevalence of headache and cold sores at any of the time points (data not shown).\n3.4. Compliance and Adverse Events\nTreatment compliance was high in both groups with no significant difference in their compliance to the study medication (Echinacea = 92.5% versus Placebo = 95%, P = 0.49). Similarly, the use of sick doses was not significantly different between both groups (Echinacea = 47% versus Placebo = 53%, P = 0.77).\nOverall, treatment was well tolerated. Adverse events such as (i) vomiting and headache, (ii) heartburn, and (iii) diarrhoea were reported by only 3 participants, respectively, but a causal relationship between Echinacea and the events could not be established. The participant who reported headache and vomiting was later unblinded as taking placebo tablets and the participant who reported heartburn and diarrhoea were later unblinded as taking Echinacea tablets. However, the participants who reported heartburn was also taking aspirin and several other medicines such as sleeping tablets.\nHowever, two participants, who were later identified as taking Echinacea, reported symptoms that were regarded as potential adverse effects from Echinacea. Both participants reported tingling and burning of the tongue and mouth immediately after taking tablets. While one participant stopped the tablets immediately and the symptoms disappeared within 24 h, the other participant continued the trial medication for over 3 weeks while symptoms worsened (sore throat, achy head, swollen legs, fever, rash, redness and itchiness on feet and legs, and a general feeling of being unwell). Following the cessation of the trial medication, symptoms disappeared within 1-21 days depending on severity and affected areas. A full blood count was normal for all parameters 3 weeks after stopping the tablets.\n4. Discussion\nIn this study, both placebo and Echinacea groups experienced respiratory illness during travel, which was indicated by raised upper respiratory symptom scores and a higher percentage of respiratory disease symptom-affected participants. This is an expected outcome as previous research has reported increased medical issues including respiratory symptoms associated with commercial flights independent of aircraft types. Studies estimate the incidence of respiratory problems between 11% as in flight emergencies based on respiratory problems and 50% as health-related problems with the 2nd most common cause being respiratory problems. Importantly, this study provides some indication that, at return from travel, participants using Echinacea displayed a lower respiratory symptom score and the overall percentage of participants affected by respiratory disease symptoms was marginally lower in the Echinacea group compared to placebo. This suggests that the Echinacea treatment may had a protective effect against the development of respiratory symptoms during the period of travel.\nThis study is the first prevention trial for Echinacea use that employs the recommended WURSS-44 as an outcome measure for respiratory-illness-related QoL. In contrast to a recent prevention trial it describes a well-powered, high-quality, placebo-controlled study. Moreover, it uses a common scenario of travel as a risk factor of attracting respiratory illness rather than artificial virus inoculation.\nThe reported discrepancy in previous clinical trial results for Echinacea is attributed to variations in applied outcome measures, treatment protocols, and, most importantly, varying Echinacea preparations. Specifically, the evaluation of herbal study medications is essential for the interpretation of clinical trial results, and the evidence of efficacy (and safety) for herbal medicines should be considered to be extract specific. This study utilised a standardised Echinacea formulation for which a phytochemical profile and pharmacokinetic data exist and which has been marketed for reducing the incidence and symptoms of cold- and flu-like symptoms in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, the USA, Canada, and South Africa.\nSimilar to the three previously mentioned prevention and inoculation trials where they used 7-14-day pre- and 5-day postinoculation treatment, participants in this study were treated 14 days prior to travel, during travel, and 14 days after travel, thus using a similar pre-, but slightly longer posttreatment. During travel (measured at return from travel) the differences between the Echinacea and placebo group were borderline significant for symptom scores and the number of participants who suffered from treatment worthy respiratory disorder symptoms (scores of 17 and above (RDS+)). This difference was further substantiated during the 4 weeks after travel (measured at follow-up), as a ~50% relative reduction of illness in the Echinacea treated group compared to placebo was observed. Our results suggest that 1 in 2 patients who suffer RDS+ would have benefited from Echinacea supplementation during travel.\nOf note, an influence of travel duration on the results is excluded as no significant difference was found between both treatment groups.\nPreparations and dosing schedules used in previous treatment and prevention trials vary widely. Our results indicate that the dosing chosen in this study will be sufficient to have a beneficial effect on respiratory health while travelling.\nThe WURSS-44 originally developed for the assessment of patients affected by cold and flu was strongly recommended for Echinacea trials and was therefore utilised in this study. Whether Echinacea will benefit general QoL is still debated, and whether it affects headache, sleep pattern, jet lag, and herpes simplex duration should be investigated by future studies using appropriate outcome measures.\nNumerous human trials have found that Echinacea is well tolerated with a slight risk of transient, reversible adverse events involving mainly gastrointestinal upsets and rashes. In rare cases, Echinacea can be associated with allergic reactions that may be severe or exacerbate asthma. Hence, plant allergy and asthma became exclusion criteria in this trial. As expected, Echinacea was generally well tolerated in this trial. We observed only two adverse events which displayed a highly likely relationship to Echinacea as they classified as allergic reactions and mimic description of allergic reactions previously described for Echinacea. Importantly, both participants recalled mild reactions to some weeds in the past. Given these findings, it should be considered to alert consumers and patients to the possibility of allergic reactions to Echinacea if they are allergic to plants in general. It is also important to note that one participant had taken other Echinacea products previously without experiencing adverse effects. This again highlights the importance of well-characterized and standardized herbal products to be able to compare efficacy and safety outcomes.\nAs with all RCTs, this study had several limitations. Whilst diaries were used to document events during participants' travel and help with the recollection of dosing, symptoms, and compliance, a certain amount of recall bias has to be expected when the surveys were completed at return and followup. This study used travel including long-haul intercontinental flights, time zone, and climate change as a model to see whether Echinacea is effective in preventing upper respiratory symptoms. Whether these findings can be generalised for other populations is debatable. In addition, the appropriateness of Echinacea use needs to be established for each individual traveller, especially those suffering from respiratory diseases (e.g., COPD, asthma, pneumonia) or immune disorders as they belong to the group of people who were excluded from this trial.\n5. Conclusion\nAlthough respiratory symptoms for both groups increased significantly during travel periods associated with long-haul flights, the increase of these symptoms for the Echinacea group was significantly lower than for the placebo group. This highlights a beneficial effect from Echinacea supplementation in adults if tablets contain 4.4 mg alkylamides from E. purpurea and E. angustifolia and are taken 14 days before and during travel. The incidence of adverse effects was low and may be predicted by thoroughly assessing the patient's medical history for plant allergies and counselling on the above-mentioned signs and symptoms of allergy thus enabling consumers to stop Echinacea formulations at the onset of an allergic response.\nMedical issues associated with commercial flights\nChanges in ocular and nasal signs and symptons among air crew in relation to air humidification on intercontinental flights\nAllergic rhinitis and ear pain in flight\nSpectrum of viruses and atypical bacteria in intercontinental air travelers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection\nRisks of travel, benefits of a specialist consult\nClinical effects of rhinovirus infections\nViral infections in exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nPerception of cabin air quality in airline crew related to air humidification, on intercontinental flights\nComplementary and alternative medicine use in Australia: a national population-based survey\nComplementary and alternative medicine use in Canada and the United States\nABC of complementary medicine: users and practitioners of complementary medicine\nEchinacea increases arginase activity and has anti-inflammatory properties in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, indicative of alternative macrophage activation\nEchinacea as an antiinflammatory agent: the influence of physiologically relevant parameters\nAntiviral activity of characterized extracts from Echinacea spp. (Heliantheae: Asteraceae) against Herpes simplex virus (HSV-I)\nInduction of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines by respiratory viruses and reversal by standardized Echinacea, a potent antiviral herbal extract\nEnhancement of innate and adaptive immune functions by multiple Echinacea species\nAlkylamides from Echinacea are a new class of cannabinomimetics.
