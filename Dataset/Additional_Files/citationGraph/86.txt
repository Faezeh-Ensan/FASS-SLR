COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic outbreak since January 2020. Taiwan has effectively contained COVID-19 community transmission. We aimed to validate whether fighting COVID-19 could help to control other respiratory infections in Taiwan.\nMethod\nWe collected week-case data of severe influenza, invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae disease and death toll from pneumonia among 25 calendar weeks of the influenza season for four years (2016-2020), which were reported to Taiwan CDC. Trend and slope differences between years were compared.\nResult\nA downturn trend of severe influenza, invasive S. pneumoniae disease and the death toll from pneumonia per week in 2019/2020 season and significant trend difference in comparison to previous seasons were noted, especially after initiation of several disease prevention measures to fight potential COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan.\nConclusions\nFighting COVID-19 achieved collateral benefits on significant reductions of severe influenza burden, invasive S. pneumoniae disease activity, and the death toll from pneumonia reported to CDC in Taiwan.\nBackground\nInfluenza seasons usually run from November (calendar week 44) to following April (calendar week 16) each year. The number of cases commonly peaks during January and February. Influenza virus infection is associated with a high disease burden. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that influenza was associated with 45 million illnesses, 21 million medical visits, 810,000 hospitalizations, and 61,000 deaths during the 2017/2018 influenza season in the United States. \nA recent study in Japan reported that influenza activity was significantly lower in the 2019/2020 season versus the 2014 to 2019 seasons. The reasons for changing influenza activity might include the closure of schools, suspension of large events, and measures to reduce the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission among the Japanese public from early in the year.\nIn January 2020, the Taiwan government assembled a taskforce to contain the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, which was initially described in Wuhan, China. Taiwan had reported 440 laboratory-confirmed cases (including 55 indigenous cases, 349 imported cases and 36 Navy members aboard a combat fleet) after examining 68,335 suspicious persons by May 14 (https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En). Taiwan effectively contained community transmission by deployments of disease prevention measures, several policy decisions, and use of information technology. The success in the containment of the COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan could verify the collateral benefit of containing influenza activity.\nWe proposed that collateral benefits on changing influenza activity and other respiratory infection activity (invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae disease) and outcome (death toll from pneumonia) would have happened in Taiwan.\nMethods\nWe use Taiwan CDC national data (https://nidss.cdc.gov.tw/en/ and https://nidss.cdc.gov.tw/ch/misc_query.aspx?dc=death_flu&amp;dt=4&amp;position=5) recording the number of PCR-confirmed severe influenza cases requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), invasive S. pneumoniae disease and overall patients died in pneumonia per week among 25 calendar weeks of the influenza season each year (2016-2020). Theil-Sen trend test was used to calculate the trend of each whole influenza season and slope difference in comparison between years (http://www.singlecaseresearch.org/calculators/theil-sen). The slope between the upward trend (before the peak) or downward trend (after the peak) was compared season by season of each year using linear trend estimation method. SAS 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for statistical analyses.\nResults\nInfluenza seasons run 25 weeks from November to following April each year. Taiwan's national severe influenza (2019/2020) case number dropped from a peak in January down to zero in March 2020 (A). The severe influenza and invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae activities were reversed from initiation of the measures to fight the COVID-19 outbreak in January (A and B). The death toll from pneumonia in the 2019/2020 influenza season was slightly downward in contrast to escalating trends of previous influenza seasons (C).\nIn Fig. 1 A, the peak weekly number of severe influenza cases increased from 2016/2017 season to 2019/2020 seasons, including 32, 74, 82, 109 cases per week in the four years respectively. The peak occurred in February (2017/2018 and 2018/2019 seasons) and January (2019/2020 season). If the peak in 2019/2020 season occurred in February as usual like the past two seasons, there would be a large outbreak of severe influenza in 2020. Nonetheless, the presumed outbreak did not happen in 2020, and a potential large influenza epidemic was abruptly shortened and reversed in January.\nA noteworthy dropping of severe influenza from the top of a 2019/2020 season (109 cases at 2nd calendar week of the year) downhill to zero cases at the 9th calendar week (in early March). During the dramatic decrease in severe influenza cases in the later period of 2019/2020 season, a substantial of cases with severe influenza-like illness up to 66 cases in calendar week 6 and a total of 230 cases in March and April (for 8 weeks) was reported to Taiwan CDC. These cases were confirmed to be negative influenza tests (Fig. 1A). The number of reported negative influenza patients with influenza-like illness among the same 8 weeks in 2020 remained similar to 2019 (totally 216, p  = 0.297) and even more than 2018 (totally 172, p  = 0.048).\nCollateral benefits on national severe influenza, invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae disease and the death toll from pneumonia while fighting COVID-19 from January 2020 in Taiwan, evidenced by significant slope difference compared to previous influenza seasons (25 weeks, from November to April of the following years).\nTable 1	 	\nInfluenza seasons	2016/2017	2017/2018	2018/2019	2019/2020	p-valuea	 	Severe influenza	 	 Mean (n/week) +- SD	13.96 +- 6.50	28.28 +- 21.87	34.60 +- 20.93	33.80 +- 34.02	0.007	 	 Theil-Sen trend (slope, 90% C.I.)	-0.50 (-0.81, -0.19)	1.03 (0.02, 2.03)	1.00 (0.16, 1.84)	-1.53 (-2.49, -0.57)		 	 Slope difference, p-value	1.03, 0.093	2.56, 0.003	2.53, 0.001	Reference		 	 :  : 	 	Invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae disease	 	 Mean (n/week) +- SD	12.16 +- 3.95	10.68 +- 5.65	9.72 +- 3.92	8.68 +- 5.16	0.069	 	 Theil-Sen trend (slope, 90% C.I.)	-0.17 (-0.37, 0.02)	0.19 (-0.04, 0.42)	0.06 (-0.08, 0.20)	-0.41 (-0.62, -0.20)		 	 Slope difference, p-value	0.24, 0.169	0.60, 0.001	0.47, 0.002	Reference		 	 :  : 	 	Death toll from pneumonia	 	 Mean (n/week) +- SD	402.29 +- 36.08	454.04 +- 70.35	442 .00 +- 49.96	457.63 +- 48.54	0.001	 	 Theil-Sen trend (slope, 90% C.I.)	1.33 (-1.27, 3.92)	6.06 (2.87, 9.24)	4.22 (1.95, 6.49)	-1.19 (-3.82, 1.43)		 	 Slope difference, p-value	2.52, 0.262	7.25, 0.004	5.41, 0.010	Reference		 	\nBy using one-way ANOVA; SD, standard deviation; C.I., confidence interval.\nThe trends of severe influenza weekly case number in 2017/2018, 2018/2019, and 2019/2020 revealed slopes of 1.03, 1.00, and -1.53, respectively. Compared to 2019/2020 influenza, the slope difference tests of influenza seasons were 2.56 (p  = 0.003) in 2017/2018 and 2.53 (p  = 0.001) in 2018/2019, both reaching statistical significance (Table 1 ). The trend also showed a downturn of weekly cases of invasive S. pneumoniae disease (slope, -0.41) in 2019/2020 influenza seasons, and compared to which, the trend difference tests were 0.60 (p  = 0.001) in 2017/2018 and 0.47 (p  = 0.002) in 2018/2019, both reaching statistical significance (Table 1 and Fig. 1B). Although the death toll from pneumonia in 2019/2020 influenza season is the highest (mean, 455) among the four-year influenza seasons (p  = 0.001), the trend of the weekly death toll from pneumonia dropped significantly in 2019/2020 (slope = -1.19), which was significantly different to 2017/2018 (slope difference = 7.25, p  = 0.004) and 2018/2019 (slope difference = 5.41, p  = 0.010) (Table 1 and Fig. 1C).\nThe slope differences between different time periods of each influenza season.\nTable 2	 	\nYearly difference by linear trend estimation (p value)	Severe influenza	Streptococcus pneumoniae	Weekly death toll from pneumonia	 		Before peak	After peak	Before peak	After peak	Before peak	After peak	 	2016/2017 vs. 2017/2018	 	 Slope difference (95% C.I.)	-2.61 (-5.73, 0.51)	1.53 (-0.25, 3.32)	0.36 (-1.61, 2.33)	-0.35 (-1.04, 0.34)	0.68 (-11.98, 13.34)	-1.60 (-8.02, 4.82)	 	 p-value	0.092	0.090	0.695	0.304	0.907	0.615	 	 :  : 	 	2017/2018 vs. 2018/2019	 	 Slope difference (95% C.I.)	-1.21 (-3.33, 0.90)	1.19 (-2.83, 2.01)	-0.75 (-2.07, 0.57)	0.43 (-0.25, 1.10)	12.00 (-1.75, 25.75)	1.22 (-7.35, 4.92)	 	 p-value	0.230	0.732	0.235	0.207	0.080	0.688	 	 :  : 	 	2018/2019 vs. 2019/2020	 	 Slope difference (95% C.I.)	1.96 (-4.49, 0.56)	1.22 (2.80, 7.79)	-0.00 (-1.35, 1.35)	0.67 (0.24, 1.10)	-13.89 (-29.27, 1.49)	7.53 (1.91, 13.14)	 	 p-value	0.114	0.0001	0.999	0.003	0.072	0.010	 	\nWe further look into if time trend (upward slope) of influenza before the peak in 2016/2017, which was insignificantly different from the slope in 2017/2018 (slope difference = -2.61, p  = 0.092) (Table 2 ). The statistical insignificance was also found in the results of 2017/2018 vs. 2018/2019 (slope difference = -1.21, p  = 0.230) and 2018/2019 vs. 2019/2020 (slope difference = 1.96, p  = 0.114). For the downward trend difference after the peak, there was no significant difference in the results of 2016/2017 vs. 2017/2018 (slope difference = 1.53, p  = 0.090) and 2017/2018 vs. 2018/2019 (slope difference = 1.19, p  = 0.732). However, the slope difference between 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 reached statistical significance (slope difference = 1.22, p  = 0.0001). The results were consistent in significant downward slope difference between 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 when examining weekly cases of invasive S. pneumoniae disease (slope difference = 0.67, p  = 0.003) and the weekly number of patients died from pneumonia (slope difference = 7.53, p  = 0.010), whereas the upward slope differences before the peak between different years were statistically insignificant (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nThe healthcare systems should report severe influenza cases to CDC in their clinical practice by the law on the prevention and control of infectious diseases in Taiwan. The decreasing influenza activity in February 2020 was not due to the negligence of physicians while focusing on fighting COVID-19 events, because substantial cases of severe influenza-like illness were still reported to the CDC in the same period, and they were turned out to be negative influenza tests. In addition, the reported death toll from pneumonia during late influenza seasons in 2020 was similar to or even higher than those in the same period of previous seasons. Finally, as COVID-19 outbreak prevailed in Wuhan, the influenza-like illness surveillance was suspended to handle the COVID-19 epidemic from the calendar week 3 (January) in Wuhan, China. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic did not really happen in Taiwan, so the CDC did not suspend the usual reporting practice. These facts would not support considering whether fighting against COVID-19 might have an influence on the physicians to report less for other respiratory infections.\nThe Theil-Sen slope, also known as the nonparametric linear regression slope, is an alternative to the standard linear regression slope and has relatively strong power and precision when data are non-normal and skewed. Therefore, we first use this method to measure the weekly case number of diseases through an influenza season. We found a significant downward trend and slope difference of severe influenza, invasive S. pneumoniae disease and death toll of pneumonia in comparison to previous seasons. Then we use the standard linear trend estimation to measure different periods before and after the peak of an influenza season, and we documented significant downward slope difference occurring after initiation of fighting COVID-19 in February 2020.\nThe Taiwan government did not lockdown cities nor close schools, restaurants, and nursing institutes. Why Taiwan could effectively contain the COVID-19 outbreak? SARS-CoV-2 was not tested by mass screening but was tested for risk persons who exposed to infected cases and for targeted indications of anyone with a fever, upper respiratory tract symptoms, or pneumonia of unknown etiology. For example, our hospital has conducted surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in 3268 patients with relevant illness from outpatient clinics, wards, and ICUs by April 28. Among them, only 1 imported case was detected (data from the intranet of Chi Mei Medical Center). Our results supported limited community transmission in Taiwan.\nTaiwan government has made several policies to integrate individual information to health care systems and the eMask ordering system. What other measures did Taiwanese public do with additional contributions to the significant reduction of severe influenza burden, invasive S. pneumoniae disease activity and the death toll from pneumonia? We herein sum up the preparedness and response to the Taiwan essential bundles according to published literature as follows: traffic flow control in hospitals to separate patients who were infected; alcohol sanitizer dispensers broadly used for hand washing and disinfection; isolation and quarantine persons confirmed or suspected to be infected; wearing a mask in public for everyone while entering a hospital or in the crowd; aerosol transmission reduced by social distancing; and no touching the face by hand and keeping safe on mask removal. \nThe limitation of the study included retrospective data analysis and thus we are unable to discern which measure of the disease prevention bundles, such as universal masking practice or hand hygiene was an independent factor responsible for the successful containment of other respiratory infections. During fighting COVID-19, patients might avoid visiting a hospital for relatively mild respiratory tract infections. However, this would not influence reported severe influenza cases requiring ICU admission.\nConclusions\nWe found collateral benefits of a significant reduction of weekly cases from severe influenza, invasive S. pneumoniae disease and the death toll from pneumonia during fighting COVID-19 in Taiwan. People raising public awareness, participating in disease prevention measures, together with hospital preparedness and response, helped the Taiwan government to contain transmission of respiratory infectious diseases and the outcome of pneumonia during the epidemic of COVID-19. The collateral benefit of nearly eradicating severe influenza supports to further study on the critical step of the disease prevention bundles, which may offer enormous help to prevent the epidemic influenza burden in the future.\nAuthor contributions\nDr Yu had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nConcept and design: Dr Yu.\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: All authors.\nDrafting of the manuscript: All authors.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: All authors.\nFinancial support\nNone declared.\nConflict of interest\nNone reported.\nReferences\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. 2017-2018 Estimated influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths and estimated influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by vaccination in the United States. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden-averted/2017-2018.htm\nSeasonal influenza activity during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Japan\nResponse to COVID-19 in Taiwan: big data analytics new technology, and proactive testing\nInitial rapid and proactive response for the COVID-19 outbreak - Taiwan's experience\nPolicy decisions and use of information technology to fight 2019 novel Coronavirus disease, Taiwan\nInterrupting COVID-19 transmission by implementing enhanced traffic control bundling: implications for global prevention and control efforts\nSARS-CoV-2 detection in patients with influenza-like illness\nTraditional and proposed tests of slope homogeneity for non-normal and heteroscedastic data\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2017-2018 Estimated influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths and estimated influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by vaccination in the United States. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden-averted/2017-2018.htm","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.6173","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Seasonal influenza activity during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Japan","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.3151","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Response to COVID-19 in Taiwan: big data analytics new technology, and proactive testing","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jfma.2020.03.007","date":"2020-03-15","title":"Initial rapid and proactive response for the COVID-19 outbreak — Taiwan's experience","abstract":"","id":"PMC7118675","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Formosan Medical Association.

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese

data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

Amid the global crisis caused by the pandemic, various public health interventions have been introduced in Korea from advice about social distancing, and personal hygiene, to testing for the virus, contact tracing, and isolation and quarantine measures.\nSocial distancing was initiated in South Korea in late February and aimed to reduce disease transmission, thereby reducing pressure on the health services. Empirical evidence during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic has shown social distancing resulted in lowering the curve of the epidemic.\nIn South Korea, national surveillance of influenza comprises of 200 sentinel sites that report the percentage of visits to healthcare centers due to influenza-like-illness (ILI), and 52 sentinel sites that send respiratory specimens from patients with ILI to national laboratories. Between the 2015-2016 and 2018-2019 flu seasons, there were multiple, distinctive waves of influenza epidemics (Figure 1A, line graph).\nIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak, civil movement and social distancing rules were implemented around late February, and included reminders regarding personal hygiene, avoiding mass gatherings, and emphasizing the staying-at-home message. On March 2nd, 2020, the government postponed the planned re-opening of schools, and on March 22nd, 2020, the government announced an intensified social distancing policy by recommending working from home, closure of religious facilities, bars, after-school clubs, and recreational facilities, and avoidance of mass gathering events. Since surveillance Week 6 of the 2019-2020 flu season, the percentage of patients with ILI decreased compared with the previous 4 flu seasons (Figure 1A). In the 2018-2019 flu season, after the first peak of influenza A (H1N1) had diminished during the surveillance Weeks 3-6, a second wave from influenza B and influenza A (H3N2) peaked during surveillance Weeks 9-19 (Figure 1B). In the 2019-2020 flu season, social distancing measures were imposed and a second wave of influenza virus was not observed.\nThe Korean national influenza virus surveillance data suggests that social distancing measures introduced in response to COVID-19 may have reduced the transmission of the virus and flattened the curve of the epidemic.\nIn a recent article, Cowling et al reported that non-pharmaceutical interventions were associated with a reduced transmission of COVID-19 and were also likely to have reduced transmission of the influenza in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, surveillance of patients with ILI depends on these patients accessing healthcare, which may have been limited by social distancing and avoidance of seeking medical care. Evidence from other geographical regions could add validity to this finding and further highlight the role played by social distancing in the transmission of circulating respiratory viruses.\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\nReferences\nDevelopment and utilization of a rapid and accurate epidemic investigation support system for COVID-19\nCoronavirus Disease-19: Quarantine Framework for Travelers Entering Korea\nAssociation of Public Health Interventions with the Epidemiology of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Wuhan, China\nNonpharmaceutical interventions implemented by US cities during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic\nThe National Influenza Surveillance System of Korea\nImpact assessment of non-pharmaceutical interventions against coronavirus disease 2019 and influenza in Hong Kong: An observational study\n(A) Impact of social distancing on influenza activity, and (B) on virus subtype detection in the Republic of Korea.\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Development and utilization of a rapid and accurate epidemic investigation support system for COVID-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.1.09","date":"2020-02-18","title":"Contact Transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea: Novel Investigation Techniques for Tracing Contacts","abstract":"In the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease, investigating, classifying, tracking, and managing contacts by identifying the patient’s route are important for preventing further transmission of the disease.\n However, omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is performed through only a proxy interview with the patient.\n To overcome these limitations, methods that can objectively verify the patient’s claims (medical facility records, Global Positioning System, card transactions, and closed-circuit television) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 contact investigations in South Korea.\n","id":"PMC7045882","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","authors":[{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30144-4","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study","abstract":"Background\nAn outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95?333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Science ;, The Lancet Pub.

This excess was highest in the 15-64 age group.\nConclusions\nCOVID-19 cases may have been present in the Catalan population when the first imported case was reported on 25 February 2020. COVID-19 carriers may have been misclassified as influenza diagnoses in primary care, boosting community transmission before public health measures were taken. The use of clinical codes could misrepresent the true occurrence of the disease. Serological or PCR testing should be used to confirm these findings. In future, this surveillance of excess influenza could help detect new outbreaks of COVID-19 or other influenza-like pathogens, to initiate early public health responses.\nStrengths and limitations of this study\nWe used good quality data covering &gt;6 million people and &gt;85% of the Catalan population, obtained directly from primary record records.\nData had previously been validated against gold-standard influenza sentinel systems.\nWe used ecological data and modelled it using data from previous seasons, therefore assuming a direct link between excess influenza cases and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nExcess influenza cases could also have been due to a panic effect, where current coronavirus epidemic had encouraged people to consult healthcare professionals more frequently and for milder symptoms than usual.\nWe lack confirmatory tests or antigenic data for the estimated excess influenza cases, but our results agree with the proportion of influenza samples that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a recent study.\nBackground\nA new infectious disease, now named COVID-19, was identified by Chinese authorities on 7 January 2020 as the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan. Caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 is asymptomatic or presymptomatic in a high proportion of patients, with estimates around 15%-30%. Most patients present mild influenza-like symptoms, including fever, dry cough, fatigue, sore throat, dyspnoea, headache and myalgia. Around 15%-20% of symptomatic cases present severe forms of disease that require hospital admission. Older people, men and those with multiple comorbidities appear more likely to suffer more serious types of COVID-19. Conversely, children seem to have a similar probability of infection, but milder and often asymptomatic forms of the disease. \nCases of COVID-19 have grown exponentially and have been reported all over the world. The first three cases in Europe were reported in France on 24 January 2020. The first imported COVID-19 case in Spain was dated 31 January 2020 in La Gomera, and the first in Catalonia reported a month after, on 25 February 2020. The total number of confirmed cases in Catalonia then increased exponentially, with 715 cumulative cases reported by 14 March 2020 and a striking 4203 on 20 March 2020. Despite these official figures, it is uncertain whether SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in the community before the first official cases. It is difficult to believe, for example, that this airborne infection did not cross the uncontrolled borders between Catalonia and France for a whole month. Some have thus speculated that undetected COVID-19 cases may have been categorised as influenza before the first official case was reported in Spain. \nCatalonia is fortunate to have a reliable system for influenza surveillance in place. A network of 60 sentinel general practitioners (GPs) covering 1% of the total population report daily cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) and take samples for differential diagnosis and confirmation of influenza infections in the region. A specialised hospital-based system takes samples from severe hospitalised influenza cases. A community-based surveillance system called Diagnosticat also extracts counts of ILI diagnoses from a network of GP health records in real-time, covering 85% of the population. This last approach allows us to examine trends with granularity and to stratify analyses by age and other factors.\nAs the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Catalonia during the influenza epidemic season and the disease shares some symptomatology with influenza, we hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 could have been circulating in the community before the first confirmed case, resulting in an excess of influenza diagnoses. We aimed to estimate the number of excess influenza cases in Catalonia, globally and by age, and to examine its relationship with the number of clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases.\nMethods\nWe used a time-series study of influenza and COVID-19 cases. We extracted data from primary-care electronic medical records covering about 85% of the population of Catalonia, around 6 million people. The study period included all influenza seasons from autumn-winter 2010-2011 to autumn-winter 2019-2020.\nThe key study outcomes were diagnoses of influenza and COVID-19. Daily frequency of influenza cases recorded in primary-care records were obtained from electronic medical records, as is routinely done for the Diagnosticat database. \nDiagnosticat is a website that reports in real-time all influenza diagnoses recorded by all GPs working at any of the primary-care centres run by the Institut Catala de la Salut (ICS). ICS is the main primary-care health service provider in Catalonia and covers about 85% of practices in the region, who all use the same electronic medical record software, ECAP. Diagnosticat includes all clinical influenza diagnosis codes (International Classification of Diseases-10 codes in online supplementary table 1) and is updated from ECAP daily (since 2010). It presents the frequency of daily influenza cases and the weekly incidence rates per 105 population, a unit that allows diagnoses to be compared between territories independently of the number of inhabitants. Influenza data on Diagnosticat has been shown to accurately represent that in a gold-standard source, the sentinel network of influenza infection reports data set. \nThe number of COVID-19 clinical diagnoses were extracted and aggregated using the same data source and methods as for influenza diagnoses. Clinical diagnoses of COVID-19 have been recorded in ECAP since 27 February 2020, when bespoke codes were introduced (online supplementary table 1). Since 15 March 2020, Catalan policies have advocated for cases to be defined based on symptoms alone, with serological or PCR confirmation only required when patients are admitted to hospital or are healthcare staff. \nStatistical analysis\nDaily counts of influenza and COVID-19 cases were computed based on the frequency of cases recorded in the previous 7-day period to avoid weekly effects on recording practice. All influenza seasons in the study period (2010-2011 to 2019-2020) were analysed separately to characterise annual epidemic curves for seasonal influenza.\nInfluenza seasons with a visually similar epidemic curve and similar peak case number to that of the 2019-2020 season were selected to model predictions for 2019-2020. We selected these specific seasons after an assessment of the number of cases at the peak to maximise comparability with the current influenza season before the COVID-19 outbreak. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were fitted to the seasons included in the analysis for the whole population and for three age groups, paediatric patients (under 15), adults (15-64) and elderly (over 64 years old).\nFrom the fitted time series, the expected speed of decrease in the number of weekly influenza cases for the 2019-2020 influenza season was calculated for each day after the peak. The expected speed of decrease was defined as the difference between the number of influenza diagnoses predicted between the current day t and the previous day t-1, divided by the number of diagnoses predicted for the previous day t-1 ((casest(casest-1)-1). Expected influenza cases were calculated using the sequence Gt = G0 * t k=1 Vk, where Gt was the expected influenza cases in the period t, G0 the number of cases at the peak and Vk the speed of decrease at day k.\nThe expected influenza cases for each day on the 2019-2020 season were calculated from the day of the season peak to 20 March 2020, the day of the data extraction. Excess influenza cases were defined as the number of observed minus expected cases, estimated daily as above. We calculated 95% CIs for each estimate. All analyses were performed in R V.3.5.1. \nWe further tested our method, as a sensitivity analysis, with data from the most recent (2018-2019) season as a negative control. We checked whether the method was able to identify the season as a 'regular' influenza season not detecting excess influenza cases.\nPatient and public involvement\nThis research was done without patient involvement. Patients were not invited to comment on the study design and were not consulted to develop patient relevant outcomes or interpret the results. Patients were not invited to contribute to the writing or editing of this document for readability or accuracy.\nResults\nPrevious influenza epidemic curves\nFour of the previous nine influenza season curves (2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2016-2017) had an epidemic curve and number of influenza cases during the peak similar to the 2019-2020 season, as shown in figure 1. These four curves were used to estimate the number of expected cases of influenza in 2019-2020. The mean peak number of cases in the included and excluded seasons was 12 762 and 14 680, respectively. The peak number of cases in 2019-2020 was 12 066.\nEpidemic curves showing the weekly number of new influenza cases during the influenza seasons from autumn-winter 2010-2011 to autumn-winter 2019-2020 in Catalonia, Spain. Curves in solid lines were similar to the 2019-2020 season and included in further modelling. Curves in dashed lines were not similar to the 2019-2020 season and were excluded from further modelling.\nARIMA models were fitted using the included seasons. Online supplementary table 2 shows the full modelling process and the fitted parameters.\n2019-2020 influenza epidemic description\nIn Catalonia, the 2019-2020 influenza epidemic reached its peak on 4 February 2020, with 12 066 cases in the previous 7 days. Figure 2 shows the evolution of the season compared with past seasons, centred on the day of the peak. By eye, the downwards trend after the peak initially looks very similar to the previous seasons. However, 20 days after the peak, the curve starts to flatten, and the slope slows down. This abnormal pattern in the descending part of the curve differs from the pattern in the previous seasons.\nEpidemic curves for the 2019-2020 Catalonia influenza season (solid line) and the four seasons in the past decade with a similar peak number of cases (dotted lines: 2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2016-2017), centred on the day of the peak number of cases in each curve.\nExpected versus observed cases\n Figure 3 shows the observed and estimated numbers of weekly new influenza cases (with 95% CI) after the peak of the 2019-2020 influenza season. The estimated expected number of cases were predicted using the selected previous influenza seasons.\nObserved and expected (with 95% CI) weekly new influenza cases each day after the peak of the 2019-2020 Catalonia influenza season, in the full population and in each age group.\nIn the whole population, observed cases were greater than expected after the seasonal influenza peak, but not always significant during the whole study period. The difference was statistically significant for 23 days between 4 February 2020 and 20 March 2020. Most of these days fell after 8 March 2020, when the difference between observed and expected increased significantly and observed cases remained above the 95% CI band for expected cases for 2 weeks.\nThere was a greater difference between observed and expected cases among people aged 15-64 years than in both the total population and other age groups, with 25 total days of significant difference. The observed and expected cases diverged earlier than for the total population, separating around 26 February 2020 and remaining significantly different for the rest of the study period.\nObserved and expected cases were generally similar in those older than 64 years, until 6 March 2020. Observed cases then quickly rose above expected cases, with the difference becoming significant on 11 March 2020 and remaining so for 9 days, until 19 March 2020.\nThe shape of the observed cases curve for people younger than 15 years was similar to that for people aged 15-64 years. However, the difference between observed and expected cases was only significantly different for 11 days, between 6 March 2020 and 16 March 2020.\nWe estimated 8017 excess influenza cases (95% CI: 1841 to 14 718) between 4 February 2020 and 20 March 2020. This excess is presented stratified by age in table 1.\nNumber of excess influenza cases in Catalonia from 4 February 2020 to 20 March 2020, after the peak of the seasonal influenza epidemic, and the percentage of all influenza cases in that period that they make up, overall and by age group\nAge group	Estimated number of excess influenza cases(95% CI)	Percentage of all influenza cases in this age group made up by the estimated excess cases(95% CI)	 	Younger than 15	2078 (160 to 4078)	13.6 (1.0 to 26.7)	 	Between 15 and 64	4670 (2387 to 7124)	20.9 (10.7 to 31.8)	 	Older than 64	142 (33 to 260)	8.9 (2.1 to 16.3)	 	Total	8017 (1841 to 14 718)	20.4 (4.7 to 37.5)	 	\nResults for our negative control influenza season are shown in online supplementary figure 1. We found no excess influenza in the previous (2018-2019) influenza season using the same method.\nExcess influenza cases compared with COVID-19 diagnoses\n Figure 4 depicts the number of excess influenza cases and COVID-19 diagnoses each day after the peak of the 2019-2020 seasonal influenza epidemic. Excess influenza cases increased rapidly from 24 February 2020, peaking on 7 March 2020. They steeply declined from 15 March 2020, coinciding with an increase in the number of COVID-19 diagnoses.\nExcess influenza cases and clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases in Catalonia, Spain, as number of cases in the previous 7-day period, from the peak of the 2019-2020 seasonal influenza epidemic (4 February 2020).\nThere were 4347 excess influenza cases and 1497 clinical diagnoses of COVID-19 on 14 March 2020, comparing with just 2575 excess influenza cases (40% less) and a striking 16 547 (539% increase) clinical diagnoses of COVID-19 on 20 March 2020.\nDiscussion\nIn mid-February 2020, we observed an unusually high, larger than expected number of influenza cases in the daily published data. In Catalonia, the 2019-2020 seasonal influenza epidemic reached its peak on 4 February 2020. Based on previous years' data, influenza diagnoses were expected to decrease rapidly over the following weeks. However, the number of influenza diagnoses instead remained stable, which was counterintuitive and inconsistent with data from past influenza seasons. This increase in observed influenza diagnoses over those expected, here named 'excess influenza', correlates over time with the observed number of COVID-19 cases. Excess influenza cases could be used in future for the early detection of competing outbreaks.\nUsing four of the previous nine influenza seasons as a benchmark, we detected 8017 excess influenza cases between 4 February 2020 and 20 March 2020. This excess was higher in people aged 15-64 years, with over 20% more cases than expected. The excess started to decrease after 15 March 2020. Worryingly, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could have already been circulating in the Catalan population when the first imported case was reported on 25 February 2020. People infected with COVID-19 may have been masked under ILI diagnoses in primary care, allowing continuing community transmission of COVID-19 before public health measures were taken.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study attempting to quantify the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in Spain by comparing the number of reported ILI cases with the expected figures based on previous influenza seasons. The excess influenza cases metric could be useful for monitoring future outbreaks of COVID-19 and other competing viral epidemics.\nOur study has several limitations. We used ecological data and modelled it using data from previous seasons, therefore assuming a direct causal link between excess influenza cases and the COVID-19 pandemic. As our method is based on crude count of influenza cases, major changes in denominator and population structure could limit the use of the proposed method, but population age and gender has remained relatively stable in the study period. Our main limitation is the possible misclassification of disease status due to limitations related to the use of clinical codes. We lack serological tests or antigenic data for confirmation, and this should be investigated to confirm our findings. Our results agree with a study that tested all influenza samples in Los Angeles for SARS-CoV-2, finding 2.2%-10.7% of the tested samples positive for the pathogen, and a centre for disease control report that times the start of limited community transmission round mid-January to February. \nThe observed excess influenza cases could have been due to a panic effect, in which the current coronavirus infodemic, a rapid spread of misinformation, has encouraged people to consult healthcare professionals more frequently and for milder symptoms than usual. However, our data showed that the number of influenza diagnoses dropped drastically and COVID-19 diagnoses increased after 15 March 2020. New COVID-19 guidelines were released on 15 March 2020 in Spain that recommended only testing hospital-admitted patients and healthcare staff and encouraging GPs to diagnose COVID-19 clinically without PCR confirmation. At least some of the excess ILI cases were thus likely to have actually been COVID-19 cases.\nOur study also has strengths. The data used were good quality, as demonstrated in many previous publications, were obtained directly from primary-care records, and have been validated against gold-standard sentinel systems. This existing database covers over 85% of the population of Catalonia, which allowed us to rapidly detect excess influenza cases across the whole population and in different age groups.\nIn conclusion, the full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic is still unknown. The confirmed number of cases may be just the tip of the iceberg, due to the lack of testing of patients presenting mild COVID-19 symptoms. We need comprehensive, well-designed, seroprevalence studies to know how many people have been infected. This novel analysis approach could offer a quantitative approach to population surveillance that may be useful for other institutions/regions/countries and could be easily integrated into current information systems. This surveillance of excess influenza cases using widely available primary-care electronic medical records could help detect new outbreaks of COVID-19 and other ILI-causing pathogens, supporting early testing and public health responses.\nSupplementary Material\nContributors: ECR, NM, AP-U, FFA, MM and DP-A contributed to the design of the study, the interpretation of the results, and reviewed the manuscript.

aimed to identify clinical characteristics and epidemiological factors associated with influenza among community-dwelling adults aged ?60 years presenting to emergency departments.\n\n\nMethods\nWe identified patients with influenza-compatible chief complaints presenting to emergency departments of six acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 influenza seasons.\n\n Clinical characteristics, medical history and demographics were collected by patient interview, chart review and by contacting vaccine providers.\n\n Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza using polymerase chain reaction.\n\n We modeled predictors of influenza using multivariable logistic regression models that compared individuals with and without influenza.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1318 participants, 151 (11 %) had influenza (98 A/H3N2, 12 A/H1N1, 4 A [not sub-typed], 37 B).\n\n In the multivariable model, clinical symptoms associated with influenza were cough (OR 6.4, 95 % CI 3.2, 13.0), feverishness and/or triage temperature ?37.2 °C (OR 3.0, 95 % CI 2.0, 4.7), 2–5 days from symptom onset to the emergency department visit (OR 2.2, 95 % CI 1.5, 3.2), and wheezing (OR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.3, 3.3).\n\n The effect of cough on influenza increased with older age.\n\n Epidemiological factors associated with increased odds for influenza included weeks when ?10 % influenza tests from provincial laboratories were positive (OR 5.1, 95 % CI 1.2, 21.7) and exposure to a person with influenza-like illness (OR 1.9, 95 % CI 1.3, 2.8).\n\n Among participants with influenza, only 47 (31 %) met the U.\n\nS.\n\n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for influenza-like illness (temperature ?37.8 °C and cough and/or sore throat).\n\n\nConclusions\nAs in younger adults, cough and feverishness are the two symptoms most predictive of influenza in the elderly.\n\n Current influenza-like illness definitions did not adequately capture influenza in older adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5084347","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

influenza, in the late 2011–2012 season in Spain, among population targeted for vaccination","abstract":"Background\nIn Spain, the influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated in the last three seasons using the observational study cycEVA conducted in the frame of the existing Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System.\n\n The objective of the study was to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI) among the target groups for vaccination in Spain in the 2011–2012 season.\n\n We also studied influenza VE in the early (weeks 52/2011-7/2012) and late (weeks 8-14/2012) phases of the epidemic and according to time since vaccination.\n\n\nMethods\nMedically attended patients with ILI were systematically swabbed to collect information on exposure, laboratory outcome and confounding factors.\n\n Patients belonging to target groups for vaccination and who were swabbed &lt;8 days after symptom onset were included.\n\n Cases tested positive for influenza and controls tested negative for any influenza virus.\n\n To examine the effect of a late season, analyses were performed according to the phase of the season and according to the time between vaccination and symptoms onset.\n\n\nResults\nThe overall adjusted influenza VE against A(H3N2) was 45% (95% CI, 0–69).\n\n The estimated influenza VE was 52% (95% CI, -3 to 78), 40% (95% CI, -40 to 74) and 22% (95% CI, -135 to 74) at 3.5 months, 3.5-4 months, and &gt;4 months, respectively, since vaccination.\n\n A decrease in VE with time since vaccination was only observed in individuals aged???65 years.\n\n Regarding the phase of the season, decreasing point estimates were only observed in the early phase, whereas very low or null estimates were obtained in the late phase for the shortest time interval.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe 2011–2012 influenza vaccine showed a low-to-moderate protective effect against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza in the target groups for vaccination, in a late season and with a limited match between the vaccine and circulating strains.\n\n The suggested decrease in influenza VE with time since vaccination was mostly observed in the elderly population.\n\n The decreasing protective effect of the vaccine in the late part of the season could be related to waning vaccine protection because no viral changes were identified throughout the season.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3848794","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

surveillance in Europe: comparing intensity levels calculated using the moving epidemic method","abstract":"Objectives\nAlthough influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) surveillance are well established in Europe, the comparability of intensity among countries and seasons remains an unresolved challenge.\n\n The objective is to compare the intensity of ILI and ARI in some European countries.\n\n\nDesign and setting\nWeekly ILI and ARI incidence rates and proportion of primary care consultations were modeled in 28 countries for the 1996/1997–2013/2014 seasons using the moving epidemic method (MEM).\n\n We calculated the epidemic threshold and three intensity thresholds, which delimit five intensity levels: baseline, low, medium, high, and very high.\n\n The intensity of 2013/2014 season is described and compared by country.\n\n\nResults\nThe lowest ILI epidemic thresholds appeared in Sweden and Estonia (below 10 cases per 100 000) and the highest in Belgium, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Serbia, and Slovakia (above 100 per 100 000).\n\n The 2009/2010 season was the most intense, with 35% of the countries showing high or very high intensity levels.\n\n The European epidemic period in season 2013/2014 started in January 2014 in Spain, Poland, and Greece.\n\n The intensity was between low and medium and only Greece reached the high intensity level, in weeks 7 to 9/2014. Some countries remained at the baseline level throughout the entire surveillance period.\n\n\nConclusions\nEpidemic and intensity thresholds varied by country.\n\n Influenza-like illnesses and ARI levels normalized by MEM in 2013/2014 showed that the intensity of the season in Europe was between low and medium in most of the countries.\n\n Comparing intensity among seasons or countries is essential for understanding patterns in seasonal epidemics.\n\n An automated standardized model for comparison should be implemented at national and international levels.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4548993","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd","authors":[{"firstname":"Tomás","surname":"Vega","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"José E","surname":"Lozano","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tamara","surname":"Meerhoff","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"René","surname":"Snacken","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Julien","surname":"Beauté","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pernille","surname":"Jorgensen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Raúl","surname":"Ortiz de Lejarazu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lisa","surname":"Domegan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joël","surname":"Mossong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jens","surname":"Nielsen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rita","surname":"Born","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amparo","surname":"Larrauri","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Caroline","surname":"Brown","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1750-2659.2012.00422.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Influenza surveillance in Europe: establishing epidemic thresholds by the Moving Epidemic Method","abstract":"\nPlease cite this paper as: Vega et al.\n (2012) Influenza surveillance in Europe: establishing epidemic thresholds by the moving epidemic method.\n Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(4), 546–558.","id":"PMC5855152","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","authors":[{"firstname":"Tomás","surname":"Vega","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jose Eugenio","surname":"Lozano","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tamara","surname":"Meerhoff","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"René","surname":"Snacken","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joshua","surname":"Mott","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Raul","surname":"Ortiz de Lejarazu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Baltazar","surname":"Nunes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1017/S0950268814001757","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Harmonizing influenza primary-care surveillance in the United Kingdom: piloting two methods to assess the timing and intensity of the seasonal epidemic across several general practice-based surveillance schemes","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Opatowski L, Baguelin M, Eggo RM.

regional surveillance networks: Case study with the influenza epidemic?","abstract":"Background\nEarly knowledge of influenza outbreaks in the community allows local hospital healthcare workers to recognise the clinical signs of influenza in hospitalised patients and to apply effective precautions.\n\n The objective was to assess intra-hospital surveillance systems to detect earlier than regional surveillance systems influenza outbreaks in the community.\n\n\nMethods\nTime series obtained from computerized medical data from patients who visited a French hospital emergency department (ED) between June 1st, 2007 and March 31st, 2011 for influenza, or were hospitalised for influenza or a respiratory syndrome after an ED visit, were compared to different regional series.\n\n Algorithms using CUSUM method were constructed to determine the epidemic detection threshold with the local data series.\n\n Sensitivity, specificity and mean timeliness were calculated to assess their performance to detect community outbreaks of influenza.\n\n A sensitivity analysis was conducted, excluding the year 2009, due to the particular epidemiological situation related to pandemic influenza this year.\n\n\nResults\nThe local series closely followed the seasonal trends reported by regional surveillance.\n\n The algorithms achieved a sensitivity of detection equal to 100% with series of patients hospitalised with respiratory syndrome (specificity ranging from 31.9 and 92.9% and mean timeliness from ?58.3 to 20.3 days) and series of patients who consulted the ED for flu (specificity ranging from 84.3 to 93.2% and mean timeliness from ?32.3 to 9.8 days).\n\n The algorithm with the best balance between specificity (87.7%) and mean timeliness (0.5 day) was obtained with series built by analysis of the ICD-10 codes assigned by physicians after ED consultation.\n\n Excluding the year 2009, the same series keeps the best performance with specificity equal to 95.7% and mean timeliness equal to ?1.7 day.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe implementation of an automatic surveillance system to detect patients with influenza or respiratory syndrome from computerized ED records could allow outbreak alerts at the intra-hospital level before the publication of regional data and could accelerate the implementation of preventive transmission-based precautions in hospital settings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4227032","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

every year.\n\n Despite Influenza variability, fast and reliable outbreak detection is required for health resource planning.\n\n Clinical health records, as published by the Diagnosticat database in Catalonia, host useful data for probabilistic detection of influenza outbreaks.\n\n\nMethods\nThis paper proposes a statistical method to detect influenza epidemic activity.\n\n Non-epidemic incidence rates are modeled against the exponential distribution, and the maximum likelihood estimate for the decaying factor ? is calculated.\n\n The sequential detection algorithm updates the parameter as new data becomes available.\n\n Binary epidemic detection of weekly incidence rates is assessed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the absolute difference between the empirical and the cumulative density function of the estimated exponential distribution with significance level 0 ? ? ? 1.\nResults\nThe main advantage with respect to other approaches is the adoption of a statistically meaningful test, which provides an indicator of epidemic activity with an associated probability.\n\n The detection algorithm was initiated with parameter ?0 = 3.8617 estimated from the training sequence (corresponding to non-epidemic incidence rates of the 2008-2009 influenza season) and sequentially updated.\n\n Kolmogorov-Smirnov test detected the following weeks as epidemic for each influenza season: 50?10 (2008-2009 season), 38?50 (2009-2010 season), weeks 50?9 (2010-2011 season) and weeks 3 to 12 for the current 2011-2012 season.\n\n\nConclusions\nReal medical data was used to assess the validity of the approach, as well as to construct a realistic statistical model of weekly influenza incidence rates in non-epidemic periods.\n\n For the tested data, the results confirmed the ability of the algorithm to detect the start and the end of epidemic periods.\n\n In general, the proposed test could be applied to other data sets to quickly detect influenza outbreaks.\n\n The sequential

MEDLINE database of biomedical articles","abstract":"Background\nReceiving extraneous articles in response to a query submitted to MEDLINE/PubMed is common.\n\n When submitting a multi-word query (which is the majority of queries submitted), the presence of all query words within each article may be a necessary condition for retrieving relevant articles, but not sufficient.\n\n Ideally a relationship between the query words in the article is also required.\n\n We propose that if two words occur within an article, the probability that a relation between them is explained is higher when the words occur within adjacent sentences versus remote sentences.\n\n Therefore, sentence-level concurrence can be used as a surrogate for existence of the relationship between the words.\n\n\nResults\nWe have developed 'Relemed', a search engine for MEDLINE.\n\n Relemed increases specificity and precision of retrieval by searching for query words within sentences rather than the whole article.\n\n It uses sentence-level concurrence as a statistical surrogate for the existence of relationship between the words.\n\n It also estimates a relevance score and sorts the results on this basis, thus shifting irrelevant articles lower down the list.\n\n\nConclusion\nBy using sentence-level matching, Relemed can deliver higher specificity, thus eliminating more false-positive articles.\n\n By introducing an appropriate relevance metric, the most relevant articles on which the user wishes to focus are listed first.\n\n Relemed also shrinks the displayed text, and hence the

(web-based) client application design.\n\n Users can introduce and edit their own data consisting of a series of weekly influenza incidence rates.\n\n The system returns the probability of being in an epidemic phase (via e-mail if desired).\n\n When the probability is greater than 0.5, it also returns the probability of an increase in the incidence rate during the following week.\n\n The system also provides two complementary graphs.\n\n This system has been implemented using statistical free-software (? and WinBUGS), a web server environment for Java code (Tomcat) and a software module

during the 2009 Influenza Virus A (H1N1) Pandemic","abstract":"Background\nGoogle Flu Trends (GFT) uses anonymized, aggregated internet search activity to provide near-real time estimates of influenza activity.\n\n GFT estimates have shown a strong correlation with official influenza surveillance data.\n\n The 2009 influenza virus A (H1N1) pandemic [pH1N1] provided the first opportunity to evaluate GFT during a non-seasonal influenza outbreak.\n\n In September 2009, an updated United States GFT model was developed using data from the beginning of pH1N1.\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe evaluated the accuracy of each U.\n\nS.\n\n GFT model by comparing weekly estimates of ILI (influenza-like illness) activity with the U.\n\nS.\n\n Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet).\n\n For each GFT model we calculated the correlation and RMSE (root mean square error) between model estimates and ILINet for four time periods: pre-H1N1, Summer H1N1, Winter H1N1, and H1N1 overall (Mar 2009–Dec 2009).\n\n We also compared the number of queries, query volume, and types of queries (e.\n\ng.\n\n, influenza symptoms, influenza complications) in each model.\n\n Both models' estimates were highly correlated with ILINet pre-H1N1 and over the entire surveillance period, although the original model underestimated the magnitude of ILI activity during pH1N1. The updated model was more correlated with ILINet than the original model during Summer H1N1 (r?=?0.95 and 0.29, respectively).\n\n The updated model included more search query terms than the original model, with more queries directly related to influenza infection, whereas the original model contained more queries related to influenza complications.\n\n\nConclusions\nInternet search behavior changed during pH1N1, particularly in the categories “influenza complications” and “term for influenza.\n\n” The complications associated with pH1N1, the fact that pH1N1 began in the summer rather than winter, and changes in health-seeking behavior each may have played a part.\n\n Both GFT models performed well prior to and during pH1N1, although the updated model performed better during pH1N1, especially during the summer months.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3158788","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Samantha","surname":"Cook","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Corrie","surname":"Conrad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ashley L.","surname":"Fowlkes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthew H.","surname":"Mohebbi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Seguiment de la grip a Catalunya","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.medcli.2012.01.020","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Base de datos SIDIAP: La historia clinica informatizada de Atencion Primaria como Fuente de informacion para La investigacion epidemiologica","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Guia d'actuacio enfront de casos d'infeccio pel nou coronavirus SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Territorial and demographic indicators.

Of Cancer Diagnoses In Electronic Health Records: Results From The Information System For Research In Primary Care (SIDIAP) In Northeast Spain","abstract":"Background\nElectronic health records are becoming an increasingly valuable resource for epidemiology but their data quality needs to be quantified.\n\n We aimed to validate twenty-five types of incident cancer cases in the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) in Catalonia with the population-based cancer registries of Girona and Tarragona as the gold-standard.\n\n\nMethods\nWe calculated the sensitivity, positive predictive values (PPV), and the time-difference between the date of diagnosis entered into the SIDIAP and into the registries.\n\n We added hospital discharge cancer diagnoses to the SIDIAP to assess sensitivity changes.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 27,046 incident cancer diagnoses in the SIDIAP from 2009–2015 among the 949,841 residents of Girona and Tarragona.\n\n The cancer types with the highest sensitivity were breast (89%, 95% CI: 88–90%), colorectal (81%, 95% CI: 80–82%), and prostate (81%, 95% CI: 80–83%).\n\n Trachea, bronchus and lung cancers had the highest PPV (76%, 95% CI: 74%-78%) followed by stomach (72%, 95% CI: 68–75%) and pancreas (71%, 95% CI: 67–75%).\n\n Most cancer diagnoses were reported with less than three months of difference between the SIDIAP and the registries.\n\n More cases were registered first in the registries than in the SIDIAP.\n\n By adding cancer diagnoses based on hospital discharge data, sensitivity increased for all cancers, especially for gallbladder and biliary tract for which the sensitivity increased by 21%.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe SIDIAP includes 76% of the cancer diagnoses in the cancer registries but includes a considerable number of cases that are not in the registries.\n\n The SIDIAP reports most of the cancer diagnoses within a three-month period difference from the date of diagnosis in the cancer registries.\n\n Our results support the use of the SIDIAP cancer diagnoses for epidemiological research when cancer is the outcome of interest.\n\n We recommend adding hospital discharge data to the

large population-based patient databases.\n These routinely generated longitudinal records have an enormous potential for epidemiological and clinical research [1–3].\n EHR contain information on the health of an individual and are an electronic version of a patient's medical history.\n This contrasts with administrative claims data, whose main purpose is administration of reimbursement of medical services to healthcare providers.\n Due to the immense size of EHR, they can offer high statistical power and can often be representative of a population.\n Linkage between different EHR can further improve the completeness of the data.\n However, the primary raison d’être of most of these EHR is for clinical, administrative or audit purposes, which is a major challenge to their use for health research.\n Data elements that would be useful for research can therefore be wrongly classified, insufficiently specified or missing.\n Misclassified data can lead to systematic measurement errors.\n Missing data can lead to selection bias and counteract the statistical power provided by the magnitude of EHR [4].\n","id":"PMC6395976","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European

to large medical records databases to establish population-scale associations between deprivation and disease.\n\n\nObjective\nTo study the association between deprivation and incidence of common cancer types in a Southern European region.\n\n\nMethods\nRetrospective ecological study using the SIDIAP (Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care) database of longitudinal electronic medical records for a representative population of Catalonia (Spain) and the MEDEA index based on urban socioeconomic indicators in the Spanish census.\n\n Study outcomes were incident cervical, breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung cancer in 2009–2012. The completeness of SIDIAP cancer recording was evaluated through linkage of a geographic data subset to a hospital cancer registry.\n\n Associations between MEDEA quintiles and cancer incidence was evaluated using zero-inflated Poisson regression adjusted for sex, age, smoking, alcoholism, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.\n\n\nResults\nSIDIAP sensitivity was 63% to 92% for the five cancers studied.\n\n There was direct association between deprivation and lung, colorectal, and cervical cancer: incidence rate ratios (IRR) 1.82 [1.64–2.01], IRR 1.60 [1.34–1.90], IRR 1.22 [1.07–1.38], respectively, comparing the most deprived to most affluent areas.\n\n In wealthy areas, prostate and breast cancers were more common: IRR 0.92 [0.80–1.00], IRR 0.91 [0.78–1.06].\n\n Adjustment for confounders attenuated the association with lung cancer risk (fully adjusted IRR 1.16 [1.08–1.25]), reversed the direction of the association with colorectal cancer (IRR 0.90 [0.84–0.95]), and did not modify the associations with cervical (IRR 1.27 [1.11–1.45]), prostate (0.74 [0.69–0.80]), and breast (0.76 [0.71–0.81]) cancer.\n\n\nConclusions\nDeprivation is associated differently with the occurrence of various cancer types.\n\n These results provide evidence that MEDEA is a useful, area-based deprivation index for analyses of the SIDIAP database.\n\n This information will be useful to improve screening programs, cancer prevention and management strategies, to reach patients more effectively, particularly in deprived urban areas.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4203762","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Garcia-Gil","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Josep-Maria","surname":"Elorza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marta","surname":"Banque","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Comas-Cufí","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jordi","surname":"Blanch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rafel","surname":"Ramos","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Leonardo","surname":"Méndez-Boo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eduardo","surname":"Hermosilla","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bonaventura","surname":"Bolibar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Prieto-Alhambra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lorenzo G.","surname":"Mantovani","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lorenzo G.","surname":"Mantovani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.medcli.2012.01.020","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Base de datos SIDIAP: la historia clinica informatizada de Atencion Primaria como fuente de informacion para la investigacion epidemiologica","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Construction and validation of a scoring system for selection of high quality data in a Spanish population primary care database (SIDIAP)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Conjunt minim basic de dades (CMBD)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hospital morbidity Survey: general methodology","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1093/annonc/mdq094","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Population-based cancer registries in Spain and their role in cancer control","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":" Indices of data Quality: All sites except non-melanoma skin (C00-96 exc.

These measures relied heavily on massive mobility restrictions, universal fever screening in all settings, and neighbourhood-based, household-focused social distancing that was enforced by large teams of community workers, as well as pervasive deployment of artificial intelligence-based social media applications and the use of big data. Whether some or all of these measures would be acceptable and feasible in settings outside of mainland China has been questioned. \nHong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China that operates with a large degree of autonomy. It is located outside the mainland on the southern coast of China, neighbouring Guangdong province:which has recorded the largest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (1490 cases as of March 31, 2020) outside of Hubei. Having been one of the most heavily affected epicentres during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, the community in Hong Kong has been prepared to respond to emerging infectious diseases. A range of public health measures have been implemented to delay and reduce local transmission of COVID-19, and there have been major changes in population behaviour.\nThe initial containment or current suppression measures used to control COVID-19 in Hong Kong include intense surveillance for infections, not only in incoming travellers but also in the local community, with around 400 outpatients and 600 inpatients tested each day in early March, 2020. Once individuals are identified to be positive for COVID-19, they are isolated in hospital until they recover and cease virus shedding. Their close contacts are traced (from 2 days before illness onset) and quarantined in special facilities, including holiday camps and newly constructed housing estates. Because not every infected person will be identified, containment measures only work if social distancing measures or behavioural changes also reduce so-called silent transmission in the community as a whole.\nResearch in context\n Evidence before this study \nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in late December 2019, in a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan. Infections increased through January until the implementation of a lockdown of Wuhan and other affected cities. Since January, 2020, COVID-19 cases have been reported outside China in increasing numbers, with many countries not taking strong control measures, such as lockdowns, until relatively larger numbers of cases had been reported. In Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan public health measures to prevent community epidemics were quickly implemented and were able to avoid the need for complete lockdowns. We searched PubMed on March 31, 2020, for studies reporting the impact of alternative public health measures against COVID-19 using keywords including &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;2019-nCoV&quot;, &quot;novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia&quot;, &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;, &quot;lockdown&quot;, &quot;social distancing&quot;, &quot;isolation&quot;, &quot;contact tracing&quot;, and &quot;quarantine&quot;. We scanned 227 published studies and found six that estimated the impact of public health measures in Wuhan or elsewhere in mainland China, one study that described the early application of testing and contact tracing in Singapore, and one study reporting the impact of quarantine on transmission on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.\n Added value of this study \nWe estimated the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in Hong Kong as a measure of transmissibility over time and found that it has remained at approximately 1 for the past 8 weeks. We described the public health measures that have been introduced to contain COVID-19 transmission and the behavioural changes reported by the population, and found that distancing measures and changes in behaviour were associated with rapid declines in influenza activity. The speed of decline in influenza activity in 2020 was quicker than in previous years in which school closures were implemented but there were no other social distancing measures or voluntary changes in behaviour.\n Implications of all the available evidence \nThe experience in Hong Kong indicates that COVID-19 transmission can be contained with a combination of testing and isolating cases, plus tracing and quarantining their close contacts, along with some degree of social distancing to reduce community transmission from unidentified cases.\nHong Kong offers an opportunity to study the impact of public health interventions and population behavioural changes that could be rolled out in resource-sufficient settings in other countries. We aimed to quantify the effect of containment measures on COVID-19. In addition, to identify whether social distancing and behavioural changes have been associated with reducing silent transmission of COVID-19, we analysed data on influenza activity as a proxy for potential changes in transmission of infection in line with the interventions implemented, assuming a similar mode and efficiency of spread of influenza and COVID-19. The specific objective of this study was to quantify population behavioural changes in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to describe the likely impact of the behavioural changes and public health measures on COVID-19 transmission and influenza transmission in the community.\nMethods\nData collection\nData on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were obtained from the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection, which provides daily updates with individual case data on a dedicated webpage.\nWe obtained sentinel surveillance data on influenza-like illnesses in a network of around 60 general outpatient clinics from the Centre for Health Protection. These include weekly reports on the proportion of outpatient consultations that were in patients with influenza-like illness, defined as fever plus cough or sore throat. We obtained laboratory surveillance data from the Public Health Laboratory Services on influenza testing results on specimens from public hospitals and sentinel surveillance sites, including the weekly number of specimens tested and the number testing positive for influenza by type and subtype. Data on the current population of Hong Kong by age and sex were obtained from the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong Government. We obtained the daily hospitalisation rates for influenza-positive cases among children in Hong Kong using the daily hospital admissions for influenza to the paediatric departments of two large hospitals in Hong Kong and the relevant catchment populations. \nWe did three cross-sectional telephone surveys among the general adult population in Hong Kong, on Jan 20-23, Feb 11-14, and March 10-13, 2020. The methods and survey instruments used were similar to those used for surveys during the SARS epidemic in 2003, the influenza A H1N1 pandemic in 2009, and the influenza A H7N9 outbreak in China in 2013. Participants were recruited using random-digit dialling of both landline and mobile telephone numbers. Telephone numbers were randomly generated by a computer system. Calls were made during both working and non-working hours by trained interviewers to avoid over-representation of non-working groups. Respondents were required to be at least 18 years old and able to speak Cantonese Chinese or English. New respondents were recruited for each survey round. Within each household, an eligible household member with the nearest birthday was invited to participate in the survey, which was not necessarily the person that initially answered the telephone. Survey items included measures of risk perception, attitudes towards COVID-19, and behaviours taken against contracting COVID-19, including hygiene, face masks, and reduction of social contact. In the second and third surveys, respondents who were parents of school-age children were asked to answer additional questions about social contact patterns of their children because schools were closed at the time of the interviews. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong. All participants gave verbal informed consent.\nStatistical analysis\nMeans and proportions of survey responses were directly weighted by sex and age to the general population. Categorical variables with ordinal Likert-type response scales, including risk perception and attitudes towards COVID-19, were first dichotomised as either above or below a threshold. Responses to perceived susceptibility were dichotomised as 1 (likely, very likely, or certain) versus 0 (never, very unlikely, unlikely, or even chance); responses to perceived severity were dichotomised as 1 (serious or very serious) versus 0 (very mild, mild, or moderate); responses about worry were dichotomised as 1 (moderately worried or very worried) versus 0 (not at all worried or slightly worried); responses about attitudes towards COVID-19 were dichotomised as 1 (agree or strongly agree) versus 0 (strongly disagree, disagree, or neutral).\nWe estimated changes in COVID-19 transmissibility over time via the effective reproduction number (R t), which represents the mean number of secondary infections that result from a primary case of infection at time t. Values of R t exceeding 1 indicate that the epidemic will tend to grow, whereas values below 1 indicate that the epidemic will tend to decline. We estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers from serial intervals and incidence of COVID-19 cases over time, assuming a serial interval of 7 5 days. We extended the approach used by Thompson and colleagues to allow for undetected cases due to censoring and imperfect detection of local cases. We assumed that 99% of imported cases and 80% of local cases would be detected. We developed a data-augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to jointly estimate the time-varying reproduction number, the delay distribution from onset to reporting which can be used to inform censoring and undetected cases. Time-varying estimates of reproduction numbers were made with a 7-day sliding window.\nTo measure changes in influenza transmissibility over time, we first calculated the influenza proxy for influenza A H1N1 during the 2019-20 winter by multiplying the weekly influenza-like illness consultation rates by the weekly proportions of specimens positive for influenza A H1N1, which was the predominant strain. This influenza proxy is a better correlate of the incidence of influenza virus infections in the community than either influenza-like illness rates or laboratory detection rates alone. We interpolated daily influenza proxy values from the weekly influenza proxy values with use of flexible cubic splines. \nUsing the daily influenza proxy, we estimated daily transmissibility via the daily effective reproduction number, R t. We used a simple branching process model for epidemic spread to estimate the time-varying intensity of transmission. We assumed the serial interval distribution for influenza followed a gamma distribution with a mean of 2 85 days and SD of 0 93 days. We repeated these analyses for the daily influenza A H1N1 hospitalisation rates among children in two large local hospitals (Queen Mary Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital). We evaluated the changes in transmissibility by comparing the R t values during the 2 weeks before and after the start of the school closures (including the Chinese New Year holidays) for the 2019-20 winter influenza season. The 95% CIs for the change in R t were calculated using Fieller's theorem. We compared the reductions in 2019-20 with reductions in previous years when the Chinese New Year holidays occurred during influenza epidemics. All analyses were done with R version 3.6.2.\nRole of the funding source\nThe funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\nResults\nCOVID-19 cases in Hong Kong by date of reporting (A) and date of symptom onset (B)\nThe Chinese New Year, a major winter festival in Hong Kong, was on Jan 25, and there were public holidays on Jan 25-28. Most schools started holidays on Jan 22 and were scheduled to resume on Feb 3. The Hong Kong Government has deferred class resumption several times and closures are now until further notice without an expected resumption date. 94 asymptomatic cases are not shown in panel B. All dates are in 2020. COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.\nAs of March 31, 2020, Hong Kong had confirmed 715 cases of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, including 386 individuals that were presumed to have acquired infection outside of Hong Kong (imported cases), 142 cases that could not be linked to any other case (unlinked local cases), and 187 cases that were linked to the other known cases (secondary cases; appendix p 1). Among these 715 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 94 were asymptomatic infections and 621 were symptomatic infections. Figure 1 shows the timeline of interventions that were implemented by the government in Hong Kong, including travel restrictions and bans, flexible working arrangements, and school closures from kindergartens up to tertiary and post-tertiary institutions, including tutorial centres. Some religious organisations cancelled services from Feb 13 onwards, and many conferences and other local mass gatherings have been cancelled. Quarantine orders have been issued to the close contacts of individuals with confirmed infection, as well as travellers arriving from affected countries (figure 1).\nIncidence and transmissibility of COVID-19 in Hong Kong\n(A) Incidence of local COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong (dark blue bars) and cases infected overseas but detected locally (light blue bars). Augmented incidence includes estimated additional cases that have occurred but have not yet been identified due to reporting delays. (B) Estimates of the daily Rt of COVID-19 over time. The pink shaded area indicates 95% CIs. The dashed line indicates the critical threshold of Rt=1. All dates are in 2020. COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019. Rt=effective reproduction number.\nAlthough unlinked COVID-19 cases have been detected in increasing numbers since early March, transmissibility (R t) remains around the critical threshold of 1 (figure 2 ). Increases in local cases could be attributed to the transmission of infections into the community, resulting from an increasing number of imported infections since early March. With a local effective reproduction number of 1, a gradual increase in the incidence of local infections would be expected.\nIncidence, hospitalisation rate, and Rt of influenza A (H1N1) in 2019-20\n(A) Weekly incidence, calculated as the weekly consultation rate multiplied by the proportion of laboratory specimens testing positive for influenza A (H1N1). (B) Daily hospitalisation rate with influenza A (H1N1) in children in two large hospitals in Hong Kong. (C) Estimated Rt in Hong Kong based on the influenza proxy data, with 95% CIs indicated by the pink shaded region. (D) Estimated Rt in Hong Kong based on the hospitalisation data, with 95% CIs indicated by the pink shaded region. We stopped estimating Rt when the local epidemic ended, indicated by a reduction in influenza proxy to very low levels and no further influenza hospitalisations in children. Dashed lines indicate the critical threshold of Rt=1. Shaded bars show the dates of Chinese New Year (light blue) and school closures (grey). Rt=effective reproduction number.\nData on influenza activity based on the community influenza proxy were consistent with the rate of hospitalisation of children with influenza A H1N1 in Hong Kong (figure 3A, B ). Influenza incidence peaked in the third week of January, with influenza A H1N1 predominating, and declined to low levels by the second week of February. The R t for influenza A H1N1 gradually declined from the second week of January but was greater than 1 before the start of the school closures and Chinese New Year. The R t then declined to less than 1 shortly after the school closures and continued to decrease until early February (figure 3C, D). The estimated R t was 1 28 (95% CI 1 26-1 30) during the 2-week period before the start of the school closures and 0 72 (0 70-0 74) during the first 2 weeks of school closures, corresponding to a 44% (34-53%) reduction in transmissibility (figure 3C). Similarly, the R t calculated from hospitalisation data was 1 10 (1 06-1 12) before the start of the school closures and reduced to 0 73 (0 68-0 77) after school closures, corresponding to a 33% (24-43%) reduction in transmissibility (figure 3D).\nIncidence and Rt of influenza in 2010-11 and 2014-15\nWeekly incidence of influenza (all type and subtypes) was calculated as the weekly consultation rate multiplied by the proportion of laboratory specimens testing positive for influenza in the winter influenza season of 2010-11 (A) and 2014-15 (B). Rt in Hong Kong was estimated based on the influenza proxy data, with 95% CIs indicated by the pink shaded region, for the winter influenza season of 2010-11 (C) and 2014-15 (D). Dashed lines indicate the critical threshold of Rt=1. Shaded bars show the dates of Chinese New Year (light blue) and school holidays (grey). Rt=effective reproduction number.\nIn comparison, during the 2010-11 winter, we estimated the reduction in transmissibility of influenza associated with the Chinese New Year holidays to be 15% (95% CI 11-19%), declining from an R t of 1 10 (1 08-1 13) in the 11-day period before the start of the school holidays to 0 95 (0 92-0 96) during the 11-day school holiday (figure 4 ). In the 2014-15 winter, the reduction in transmissibility associated with the Chinese New Year holidays was 14% (7-22%), declining from an R t of 0 94 (0 93-0 96) in the 11-day period before the start of the school holidays to 0 81 (0 75-0 86) during the 11-day school holiday.\nPublic attitudes, risk perceptions, and behavioural responses towards COVID-19 and seasonal influenza in three telephone surveys in Hong Kong\n	Survey 1, Jan 20-23 (n=1008)	Survey 2, Feb 11-14 (n=1000)	Survey 3, March 10-13 (n=1005)	 	Risk perception of COVID-19	 	Perceived susceptibility to COVID-19*	186 (18 9%; 16 0-21 9)	185 (17 4%; 14 8-20 1)	140 (15 2%; 12 6-17 8)	 	Perceived severity of COVID-19 	916 (89 6%; 85 8-93 3)	902 (90 5%; 86 4-94 7)	829 (82 0%; 78 6-85 4)	 	Worried about being infected with COVID-19 	551 (52 5%; 48 7-56 3)	558 (53 9%; 49 9-57 9)	471 (46 5%; 42 9-50 0)	 	Risk perception of seasonal influenza	 	Perceived susceptibility to seasonal influenza*	260 (25 1%; 22 0-28 3)	231 (22 5%; 19 4-25 6)	NA	 	Perceived severity of seasonal influenza 	406 (42 3%; 38 4-46 3)	311 (32 7%; 28 9-36 6)	NA	 	Worried about being infected with seasonal influenza 	370 (36 5%; 32 9-40 0)	283 (30 3%; 26 6-33 9)	NA	 	Attitudes towards COVID-19 	 	I'm confident that I can take measures to protect myself against COVID-19	518 (50 5%; 46 6-54 4)	594 (59 2%; 54 9-63 5)	679 (68 0%; 64 3-71 7)	 	I believe that the Hong Kong Government can take effective measures to control the spread of COVID-19 in Hong Kong	338 (33 5%; 29 9-37 1)	271 (31 8%; 27 8-35 8)	336 (35 8%; 32 2-39 3)	 	I believe that the Central Chinese Government can take effective measures to control COVID-19	308 (31 7%; 28 1-35 3)	352 (39 0%; 34 8-43 2)	NA	 	I believe that complete border closure is an effective measure to prevent COVID-19 spreading from mainland China to Hong Kong	NA	784 (76 4%; 72 3-80 5)	NA	 	Complete border closure will seriously affect the life of citizens	NA	298 (33 2%; 29 2-37 1)	NA	 	I worry about medical supplies, such as face masks, in Hong Kong	NA	860 (84 1%; 80 0-88 2)	NA	 	I worry about the living supplies in Hong Kong due to border closure	NA	244 (27 7%; 24 0-31 4)	NA	 	Preventive measures taken against COVID-19 	 	Avoided going to crowded places	627 (61 3%; 57 2-65 4)	920 (90 2%; 86 2-94 2)	860 (85 1%; 81 7-88 4)	 	Avoided visiting mainland China	800 (78 1%; 73 9-82 2)	NA	NA	 	Avoided contact with people with respiratory symptoms	687 (66 8%; 62 7-70 9)	834 (80 0%; 76 0-84 0)	806 (78 7%; 75 3-82 1)	 	Used face masks	778 (74 5%; 70 4-78 6)	976 (97 5%; 93 5-100 0)	992 (98 8%; 96 0-100 0)	 	Washed hands more often (including using hand sanitiser)	726 (71 1%; 67 0-75 2)	938 (92 5%; 88 6-96 5)	941 (93 0%; 90 0-96 0)	 	Avoided touching public objects or used protective measures when touching public objects (eg, use tissue)	387 (36 4%; 32 3-40 5)	767 (73 8%; 69 8-77 9)	746 (73 1%; 69 6-76 7)	 	House disinfection	NA	897 (89 3%; 85 2-93 4)	899 (89 6%; 86 4-92 8)	 	Used serving utensils when eating	NA	686 (66 0%; 61 9-70 1)	692 (67 7%; 64 1-71 3)	 	Stayed at home as much as possible	NA	894 (88 0%; 83 9-92 1)	868 (83 8%; 80 5-87 1)	 	Avoided going to health-care facilities	NA	832 (81 0%; 77 0-85 1)	759 (74 7%; 71 1-78 3)	 	\nData are n (%; 95% CI).

Respondents included a broad cross-section of the adult population of Hong Kong (appendix p 2). Respondents perceived that they had similar susceptibility to COVID-19 as they did to seasonal influenza, but that COVID-19 was a much more serious infection, and around half of the respondents reported worrying about being infected with COVID-19 compared with around a third of respondents for seasonal influenza (table ). In survey 2, 76 4% of respondents agreed with the statement that complete border closure would be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 to Hong Kong, 84 1% were worried about the availability of medical supplies, including face masks, but only 27 7% were worried about the availability of living supplies, including food and household goods, in Hong Kong (table).\nWe identified considerable increases in the use of preventive measures in response to the threat of COVID-19. In recent years, face masks have mainly been used by individuals in the general community who are ill and by those who feel particularly susceptible to infection and want to protect themselves. We found that 74 5%, 97 5%, and 98 8% of respondents wore masks when going out; 61 3%, 90 2%, and 85 1% avoided going to crowded places; and 71 1%, 92 5%, and 93 0% reported washing or sanitising their hands more often, in surveys 1, 2, and 3, respectively (table). In surveys 2 and 3, 88 0% and 83 8% reported staying at home as much as possible.\nIn surveys 2 and 3, we asked the subset of respondents who were parents of school-age children about their support for school closures and the activities of their children during the school closures. Among respondents who were parents, 249 (95 4%) of 261 and 192 (93 7%) of 205 agreed or strongly agreed that school closure was needed as a control measure for COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and 209 (80 1%) of 261 and 141 (68 8%) of 205 responded that their children had no contact with people other than their household members on the preceding day.\nDiscussion\nOur findings suggest that the package of public health interventions (including border entry restrictions, quarantine and isolation of cases and contacts, and population behaviour changes, such as social distancing and personal protective measures) that Hong Kong has implemented since late January, 2020, is associated with reduced spread of COVID-19. In the 10 weeks (corresponding to about ten generation times) since the first known individual with COVID-19 in Hong Kong began to show symptoms, there has been little sustained, local transmission of the disease. Our findings strongly suggest that social distancing and population behavioural changes:that have a social and economic impact that is less disruptive than total lockdown:can meaningfully control COVID-19.\nThe increasing number of imported infections in March poses a challenge to suppression efforts. This increase has occurred at the same time as relaxation of some voluntary avoidance behaviours in the general community. Without a strengthening of social distancing measures, local infections are likely to continue to occur, given that the effective reproduction number is approximately 1 or slightly higher than 1. Travel measures and testing, tracing, and treating efforts are particularly important in maintaining suppression, although these measures will be increasingly difficult to implement as case numbers increase.\nIn addition to the identification of cases with isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, social distancing has also likely played an important role in suppressing transmission. We found that control measures and changes in population behaviour coincided with a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early February, 2020. This observation suggests that the same measures would also have affected COVID-19 transmission in the community, because there will be some similarities:as well as some differences:in the modes of transmission of influenza and COVID-19. The potentially higher basic reproduction number for COVID-19 indicates that it might be more difficult to control than influenza. Because a variety of measures were used simultaneously, we were not able to disentangle the specific effects of each one, although this may become possible in the future if some measures are strengthened or relaxed locally, or with use of cross-national or subnational comparisons of the differential application of these measures.\nThe estimated 44% reduction in influenza transmission in the general community in February, 2020, was much greater than the estimated 10-15% reduction in transmission associated with school closures alone during the 2009 pandemic, and the 16% reduction in transmission of influenza B associated with school closures during the 2017-18 winter in Hong Kong. We therefore estimate that the other social distancing measures and avoidance behaviours have had a substantial effect on influenza transmission in addition to the effect of school closures. However, if the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Hong Kong exceeds 2, (it was 2 2 in Wuhan), we would need more than a 44% reduction in COVID-19 transmission to completely avert a local epidemic. A reduction of this magnitude could, however, substantially flatten the peak of and area under the epidemic curve, thus reducing the risk of exceeding the capacity of the health-care system, and potentially saving many lives, especially among older adults.\nThe postponement of class resumption in local schools in Hong Kong after the Chinese New Year holiday is technically a class dismissal or suspension rather than a school closure, because most teachers are still required to go to school premises to plan e-learning activities and set homework. Full school closures have been implemented locally in previous years, including during the SARS epidemic in 2003, during the influenza pandemic in 2009, and to control seasonal influenza epidemics in 2008 and 2018. Although school closures can have considerable effects on influenza transmission, their role in reducing COVID-19 transmission would depend on the susceptibility of children to infection and their infectiousness if infected. Both of these factors are major unanswered questions at present. Despite this acknowledged uncertainty, our surveys revealed considerable local support for school closures.\nIndividual behaviours in the Hong Kong population have changed in response to the threat of COVID-19. People have been choosing to stay at home, and in our most recent survey, 85% of respondents reported avoiding crowded places and 99% reported wearing face masks when leaving home. Using similar surveys, face mask use during the SARS outbreak in 2003 was 79%, and it reached a maximum of 10% during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009. These changes in behaviour indicate the level of concern among the population about this particular infection, and the extent of voluntary social distancing in addition to the distancing created by school closures. However, we did identify evidence of reductions in voluntary social distancing behaviours in our third survey in March, perhaps indicating some fatigue with these measures.\nOur study has some limitations. First, we could not identify which measure was potentially the most effective and whether border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, or behavioural changes are most important in suppressing COVID-19 transmission. It is likely that each plays a part. Unlinked cases have been identified in the community and will continue to be identified, indicating that not every chain of transmission has been identified by contact tracing from known cases. Although we have noted major effects of control measures and behavioural changes on influenza transmission, the effects could be of a different magnitude for COVID-19 because of differences in transmission dynamics. Second, our surveys of population behaviours could have been affected by response bias, because we relied on self-reported data. They also could have been affected by selection bias away from working adults, although this should have been reduced by conducting surveys in non-working as well as working hours:we were unable to assess potential selection bias. Without a baseline survey before Jan 23, 2020, we could not compare changes in behaviours, although the results of similar surveys from previous epidemics can be used for comparison. Finally, although we identified reductions in the incidence of influenza virus infections in outpatients and paediatric inpatients, it is possible that these time series were affected by reduced health-care-seeking behaviours and limited health-care access that probably resulted from private clinic closure, which occurred around the period of the Chinese New Year holiday.\nIn conclusion, our study suggests that measures taken to control the spread of COVID-19 have been effective and have also had a substantial impact on influenza transmission in Hong Kong. Although the transmission dynamics and modes of transmission of COVID-19 have not been precisely elucidated, they are likely to share at least some characteristics with influenza virus transmission, because both viruses are directly transmissible respiratory pathogens with similar viral shedding dynamics. The measures implemented in Hong Kong are less drastic than those used to contain transmission in mainland China, and are probably more feasible in many other locations worldwide. If these measures and population responses can be sustained, avoiding fatigue among the general population, they could meaningfully mitigate the impact of a local epidemic of COVID-19.\nData sharing\nData on the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 and influenza activity are freely available from the Centre for Health Protection website (https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/index.html).

mathematical modelling study","abstract":"Background\nAn outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95?333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Science ;, The Lancet Pub.

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

The COVID-19 pandemic could increase public concern to prevent infectious disease. The present study aimed to assess the relationship between the COVID-19 epidemic and the potential decrease in seasonal influenza cases.\nMethods\nThis study was performed to show trends in seasonal influenza cases from the 2014-2015 season to the 2019-2020 season in 11 countries and regions, and evaluate whether the trends in the 2019-2020 season were different before and after the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous seasons using a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference design.\nResults\nIn East Asia, the number of seasonal influenza cases in the 2019-20 season was lower after the COVID-19 transmission compared to previous years. However, this was not the case in American countries or in European countries.\nConclusion\nThe COVID-19 epidemic might have altered health behaviors, resulting in an unexpected reduction of seasonal influenza cases.\nIntroduction\nThe number of people infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has surged worldwide since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has been featured extensively in both traditional and social media, leading to high levels of attention to a previously unknown respiratory disease and to risk perception among the public. Moreover, infection prevention and control strategies to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in community settings have aligned with those used for other common respiratory viral infections such as influenza; such strategies have included hand hygiene, cough etiquette, and avoiding close contact with sick persons. We aimed to identify the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the incidence of seasonal influenza in different regions and countries.\nMethods\nThe subjects resided in the following 11 countries and regions: Northern China, Southern China, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Canada, the United States (US), England, France, and Germany. We extracted weekly reports of seasonal influenza data from the 2014-15 season through to the 2019-20 season, from epidemiological (EPI) week 40 to EPI week 10, using the open-access databases of each public health authority. The seasonal influenza data was summarized by country and by region. We conducted a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference (DID) design to examine whether the trend in the number or proportion of patients with influenza before and after January 20 of this season (2019-20) was different from those of the previous five seasons (2014-15 to 2018-19). Of note, the Chinese healthcare authorities officially reported human-to-human transmission on January 20, 2020. Therefore, we proceeded on the premise that public concern presumably derived from the COVID-19 pandemic affected the incidence of influenza after January 20, 2020 (EPI week 4).\nResults\nTrends in patients with influenza in 11 countries/regions over six seasons. ILI = influenza-like illness; PMP = private medical practitioner; ILINet = Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network; GP = general practitioner.\nFigure 1\nSince EPI week 4 of the 2019-20 season, the US, Canada, and European countries have experienced similar trends in the fluctuation of seasonal influenza cases to those experienced in previous seasons. In contrast, some Asian regions experienced different trends in influenza incidence this season from those experienced in past seasons (Figure 1 ). In Northern and Southern China, the number of influenza patients fluctuated without following any consistent trend in the 2019-20 season. The number of patients infected with influenza in Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan was significantly lower after EPI week 4 of the 2019-20 season than in previous influenza seasons. The numbers of influenza cases this season did not peak in these countries as they had in past seasons. Conversely, the number of influenza cases in the Republic of Korea in the 2019-20 season was similar to the number of cases seen in previous years. Although we also investigated the number of influenza specimens tested, the data were unavailable for most countries and regions. We could collect the data in Northern China, Southern China, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, and the US (Supplementary material). Based on the available data, the number of influenza tests in the Republic of Korea gradually decreased after EPI week 4 in this season compared to previous seasons. However, the COVID-19 epidemic seems to have had a minor impact on influenza tests in other Asian regions and the US.\nDiscussion\nSince Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan are geographically proximal to China, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in China might have affected the public more directly in these countries than in other countries. Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan reported imported cases from China in the evolving phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, and public concern about the COVID-19 outbreak could have risen dramatically as a result. The citizens of these areas might have taken robust preventive measures, including wearing masks, hand hygiene, and even self-imposed physical distancing. Consequently, these precautionary measures may have helped to prevent influenza transmission.\nWe propose that not only geographic differences but also cultural differences could have enhanced self-protective habits. For instance, although the degree of protection from virus transmission offered by wearing face masks is uncertain, people in Asian regions routinely wore masks in public even before the COVID-19 outbreak, whereas this practice was not commonly seen in the US or in European countries. Also, norms concerning interpersonal distance, hugging, and handshakes vary from culture to culture.\nThe findings of the present study have limitations. First, this study was an ecological study. Therefore, we could not directly analyze the association between the COVID-19 outbreak and behavior changes to avoid respiratory virus infection. Second, our findings might be affected by the number of influenza tests during the COVID-19 epidemic. Still, the present study's results provide some insight into the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the reduction of other infectious diseases.\nFunding\nThis research was partly supported by Institute for Health Economics and Policy, Japan.\nEthics approval\nBecause this study involved secondary analysis of publicly available, de-identified data, it was exempt from institutional review board review.\nConflict of interest\nAll authors have no conflict of interest to declare.\nReferences\nRisk, ritual and health responsibilisation: Japan's 'safety blanket' of surgical face mask-wearing\nHow to Protect Yourself\nQualitative study on the shifting sociocultural meanings of the facemask in Hong Kong since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak: implications for infection control in the post-SARS era\nPreferred interpersonal distances: a global comparison\nWHO emergency group to meet on spreading China virus\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation reports\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: when and how to use masks\nSupplementary data\nThe following is Supplementary data to this article: \nSupplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.088.\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk, ritual and health responsibilisation: Japan's 'safety blanket' of surgical face mask-wearing","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"How to Protect Yourself","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Qualitative study on the shifting sociocultural meanings of the facemask in Hong Kong since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak: implications for infection control in the post-SARS era","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World Health Organization.
